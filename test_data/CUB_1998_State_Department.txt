 CUBA
 Cuba is a totalitarian state controlled by President Fidel Castro, who is Chief of
 State, 'Head of Government, First Secretary of the Communist Party, and com-
 mander in chief of the armed forces. President Castro exercises control over all as-
 pects of Cuban life through the Communist Party and its affiliated mass organiza-
 tions, the government bureaucracy, and the state security apparatus. The Com-
 munist Party is the only legal political entity, and President Castro personally
 chooses the membership of the Politburo, the select group that heads the party.
 There are no contested elections for the 601-member National Assembly of People's
 Power (ANPP), which meets twice a year for a few days to rubber stamp decisions
 and ]poicies already deided by the Government. The Party ontrols all government
 positions, including judicial offices. The judicary is completely subordinate to the
 Government and to the Communist Party.t
 The Ministry of Interior is the principal organ of state security and totalitarian
 control. Offiers of the Revolutionry Armed Frces (FAR), which are led by Presi-
 dent Castro's brother Raul, have been assigned to the majority of key positions in
 the Ministry of Interior in recent years. In addition to the routine law enforcement
 functions of regulating migration and controlling the Border Guard and the regular
 police forces, the Interior Ministry's Department of State Security investigates and
 actively suppresses opposition and dissent. It maintains a pervasive system of vigi-
 lance through undercover agents, informers, the rapid response brigades, and the
 Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR's). While the Government tradi-
 tionally used the CDR's to mobilize citizens against dissenters, impose ideological
 conformity, and root out "counter-revolutionary' behavior, severe economic problems
 have reduced the Government's ability to reward participation in the CDR's and
 hence the willingness of citizens to participate in them, thereby lessening the CDR's
 
 
 effectiveness. Other mass organizations also inject government and Communist
 Party control into citizens' daily activities at home, work, and school. Members of
 the security forces committed serious human rights abuses.
 The Government continued to control all significant means of production and re-
 mained the predominant employer, despite permitting some carefully controlled for-
 eign investment in joint ventures with the Government. In most cases, foreign em-
 ployers are allowed to contract workers only through state agencies, which receive
 large hard currency payments for the workers' labor but in turn pay the workers
 a small fraction of this, usually 5 percent, in local currency. In May the Government
 continued its retractions of changes that had led to the rise of legal nongovern-
 mental business activity when it further tightened restrictions on the self-employed
 sector by reducing the number of categories allowed and by exacting relatively high
 taxes on self-employed persons. According to the Government's official press, the
 number of self-employed persons dropped by almost one-fourth to less than 150,000.
 The Government admits that the economic growth rate fell to about 1 percent, de-
 spite forecasts that it would be some 2.5 to 3.5 percent. The economy remained de-
 pressed due to the inefficiencies of the centrally controlled economic system; the col-
 lapse of trade with the former Soviet bloc; the loss of billions of dollars of annual
 Soviet subsidies; the ongoing deterioration of plant, equipment, and the transpor-
 tation system; and the continued poor performance of the important sugar sector.
 The 1997-98 sugar harvest appears to have been the worst in more than 50 years.
 For the eighth straight year, the Government continued its austerity measures
 known euphemistically as the "special period in peacetime." Agricultural markets,
 legalized in 1994, gave consumers wider access to meat and produce, although at
 prices beyond the reach of most citizens living on peso-only incomes or pensions.
 Given these conditions, the flow of hundreds of millions of dollars in remittances
 from the exile community significantly helps those who receive dollars to survive.
 Tourism remained a key source of revenue for the Government. The system of "tour-
 ist apartheid" continued, with foreign visitors who pay in hard currency receiving
 preference over citizens for food, consumer products, and medical services. Citizens
 remain barred from tourist hotels, beaches, and resorts.
 The Government's human rights record remained poor. It continued systemati-
 cally to violate fundamental civil and political rights of its citizens. Citizens do not
 have the right to change their government peacefully. There were several credible
 reports of death due to excessive use of force by the police. Members of the security
 forces and prison officials continued to beat and otherwise abuse detainees and pris-
 oners. The Government failed to prosecute or sanction adequately members of the
 security forces and prison guards who committed such abuses. Prison conditions re-
 mained harsh. The authorities routinely continued to harass, threaten, arbitrarily
 arrest, detain, imprison, and defame human rights advocates and members of inde-
 pendent professional associations, including journalists, economists, doctors, and
 lawyers, often with the goal of coercing them into leaving the country. The Govern-
 ment used internal and external exile against such persons, and political prisoners
 were offered the choice of exile or continued imprisonment. The Government denied
 political dissidents and human rights advocates due process and subjected them to
 unfair trials. The Government infringed on citizens' rights to privacy. The Govern-
 ment denied citizens the freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and association. It
 limited the distribution of foreign publications and news to selected party faithful
 and maintained strict censorship of news and information to the public. The Govern-
 ment restricts some religious activities but permits others. It allowed a visit by Pope
 John Paul II, permitted some public processions on feast days, and reinstated
 Christmas as an official holiday, but has not responded to the Papal appeal that
 the Church be allowed to play a greater role in Cuban society. In November the
 Government allowed some new priests and religious workers to enter the country,
 but the applications of many other priests and religious workers remained pending.
 The Government kept tight restrictions on freedom of movement, including foreign
 travel. The Government was sharply and publicly antagonistic to all criticism of its
 human rights practices and sought to discourage and thwart foreign contacts with
 human rights activists. Racial discrimination often occurs. The Government severely
 restricted worker rights, including the right to form independent unions. The Gov-
 ernment employs forced labor, including that by children.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings. However, there were several credible reports of deaths due to the
 
 
 578
 excessive use of force by the national police; government sanctions against perpetra-
 tors were nonexistent or light.
 On March 30, police detained Wilfredo Martinez Perez, a member of a human
 rights organization, for disorderly conduct at a public festival near his home in Ha-
 vana. Martinez's body was delivered to a funeral home in Guines the next day
 where his family and other witnesses claimed that his body showed contusions and
 bruises, which suggested that he died as a result of a beating while in police cus-
 tdy. Human rights groups did not attach a political motive to the death, but as
 end there were no reports of an investigation into the matter.
 ay 26  olice engaged in a foot chase of a suspect entered the home of Yuset
 Ochotereno in avana and mistakenly shot and kilfed him. At his funeral 2 days
 later in central Havana's Plaza of the Revolution, over 1,000 persons participated
 in a spontaneous demonstration against police excesses. At year's end, there were
 no reports that the shooting had been investigated properly.
 Human Rights Watch reported that on June 30 Havana police arrested Reinery
 Marrera Toledo on a charge of accessory to illegai sacrifice of livestock. On July 9,
 the authorities told his family that he had committed suicide by hanging himself
 with a sheet. However, a family member who viewed the body noted heavy bruising,
 raisin questions about the police account of Marrera's death.
 In October 1996, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR)
 issued its final report on the Government's July 13, 1994, sinking of the "13th of
 March" tugboat, which killed 41 persons, including women and children The
 IACHR concluded that the Government violated the American Declaration on the
 Rights and Duties of Man and found the Government legally obligatd to indemnify
 the survivors and the relatives of the victims for the damages caused. At year's en,
 the Government had not done so. The Government actively sought to intimidate
 family members and human rights activists to prevent them from commemorating
 the killings (see Section 2.b.).
 There were no developments in the case of El Salvadoran citizen Raul Ernesto
 Cruz Leon, who was arrested in September 1997 and charged with being the "mate-
 rial author" of the killing of an Italian tourist that month with a bomb, one of a
 series of explosions in Havana. Four other suspects remained in custody; no trials
 had been scheduled as of year's end.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punzshment.-
 The Constitution prohibits abusive treatment of detainees and prisoners; however,
 there were instances in which members of the security forces beat and otherwise
 abused human rights advocates, detainees, and prisoners. There have been numer-
 ous reports of disproportionate police harassment of black youths (see Section 5).
 In April guards reportedly beat Fidel Basulto Garcia, a prisoner at the Combinado
 del Est prison outside Havana, because he refused to give them a ring he was
 wearing. In the same month, inmates convicted of common crimes at a prison in
 Sancti Spirits beat political prisoner Adiane Jordan Contreras, reportedly at the
 instigation of prison officials who had been unable to force Jordan to shout
 progovernment slogans.
 On April 16, a prison guard and one of the prison's state security officers beat
 independent journaist Bernardo Arevalo Padron, who was jailed at Ariza prison in
 Cienfuegos. Although the authorities reportedly forced the prison guard to retire,
 they only transferred the state security officer to similar duties at another prison
 after a brief suspension.
 On June 5, authorities at Combinado de Guantanamo prison severely beat politi-
 cal prisoner Nestr Rodriguez Lobaina, president of the Youth for Democracy move-
 ment. The authorities then aggressively harassed Rolando Mazo Perez, an inmate
 who witnessed the beating, to intimidate Mazo and prevent him from providing tes-
 timony about the incident. Human rights monitors reported that the pressure on
 Mazo caused him to attempt suicide on June 25. A month later, a large group of
 prison guards agi reportedly beat Rodriguez and another prisoner, Francisco Diaz,
 who tried to help Rodriguez. In November the authorities released Rodriguez from
 prison; in December he requested an exit permit to attend a ceremony in Paris but
 they ignored his request (see Section 2.d.). When Rodriguez attempted to stage a
 hunger strike outside the Foreign Ministry, the authorities detained him and his fa-
 ther, who was accompanying him. They forcibly returned Rodriguez to Santiago de
 Cuba under guard and warned him not to return to Havana.
 State security officials on two separate occasions told the elderly, pensioned moth-
 er of political prisoner Jesus Chamber Ramirez to travel 700 miles from her home
 in Santiago de Cuba to Havana because, they claimed, her son was being taken to
 a diplomatic mission to process his departure from the country. Chamber was not
 brought to Havana; the ploy was a state security ruse to bring pressure on Chamber
 
 
 by making his mother undertake the expensive and arduous journey. Chamber, who
 was sentenced to 10 years in prison for 'enemy propaganda" and "disrespect for gov-
 ernment authority," regularly was denied family visits because of his insistence on
 treatment as a political rather than a common prisoner. Chamber held numerous
 hunger strikes of short duration to protest poor prison conditions. Human rights ac-
 tivists reported that while in prison, he continued to be beaten and punished for
 demanding better treatment. On November 20, the authorities released Chamber
 and another political prisoner at the request of the Spanish Foreign Minister, on
 the condition that both men leave the country for Spain (see Section 1.d.).
 According to eyewitnesses, on November 27 special brigade riot police repeatedly
 punched and kicked a number of prodemocracy advocates, including Milagros Cruz,
 who is blind. Those assaulted were participating in a demonstration outside Hava-
 na's provincial courthouse in support of independent journalist Mario Viera. Viera
 was scheduled to go on trial that day for allegedly defaming a government official
 (see Section 2.a.). Police moved against the dissidents a   a group of about 100
 progovernment rapid response brigade members appeared on the scene and began
 to taunt, shove, and hit the somewhat smaller group of Viera supporters (see Sec-
 tion 2.b.). In Havana police chased, beat, and detained 10 activists outside a church
 (see Section 2.c.).
 The Government continued to subject those who disagree with it to "acts of repu-
 diation." At government instigation, members of state-cntrolled mass organizations,
 fellow workers, or neighbors of intended victims are obliged to stage public protests
 against those who dissent with the Government's policies, shouting obscenities and
 often causing damage to the homes and property of those targeted; physical attacks
 on the victims sometimes occur. Police ade state security agents are often present
 but take no action to prevent or end the attacks. Those who refuse to participate
 in these actions face disciplinary action, including loss of employment.
 On September 18, local CDR, state security, and Communst Party officials staged
 an act of repudiation outside the home of Miriam  Garcia Chavez, president of the
 independent teachers association in Havana. Some 60 primary school students in
 school uniform were compelled to line up and join adult leaders in chants of "Viva
 a revolucion" and "Viva Fidel," as well as other chants that disparaged prodemoc-
 racy activists for half an hour during a rainstorm. On the same day, insulting leaf-
 lets were thrown in front of the home of Dr. Augstin Madrigal, leader of an inde-
 pendent medical association. In the days following these incidents, garbage was
 piled outside the home of independent labor activist Jose Orlando Bridon, which
 also was painted with graffiti.
 On October 2, Communist Party, local government, and state security  personnel
 staged an act of repudiation against the family of independent journalist Manuel
 Antonio Gonzalez in San German, Holgin province. This action followed Gonzalez's
 detention on October 1 at a local police station on charges of disrespect for allegedly
 insulting Fidel Castro. On October 2, Gonalez family members, reportedly angered
 by the treatment they received when they inquired at the police station about Gon-
 zalez's situation, wrote antigovernment graffiti on their home. Local party and gov-
 ernment officials then assembled workers from two local enterprises, as well as pri-
 mary and secondary students from nearby schools, at the Gonzalez house and led
 the crowd in chanting insults and progoverment slogans. According to eye-
 witnesses, men in plainclothes battered in the door and beat several of the persons
 inside. The police arrested four of the victims, while officials ordered the crowd to
 paint over the graffiti. Human rights activists characterized the attack as the larg-
 est and most violent such incident in over 10 years.
 Prison conditions continued to be harsh, and conditions in detention facilities also
 are harsh. The Government claims that prisoners have rights, such as family visita-
 tion, adequate nutrition, pay for work, the right to request parole, and the right to
 petition the prison director. However, police and prison officials often denied these
 rights and used beatings, neglect, isolation, and denial of medical attention against
 detainees and prisoners, including those convicted of political crimes or those who
 persisted in expressing their views. There are separate prison facilities for women
 and for minors.
 Prison officials regularly denied prisoners other rights, such as the right of cor-
 respondence, and continued to confiscate medications and food brought by family
 members for political prisoners. State security officials in Havana's Vaa Marista fa-
 cility took medications brought by family members for inoaes and then refused to
 givetta the tine the medicine, despite repeated assurances that they would. Pris-
 on authorities also routinely denied religious workers access to detainees and pris-
 oners.
 The rights to adequate nutrition and medical attention while in prison also were
 violated regularly. In 1997 the IACHR described the nutritional and hygienic situa-
 
 
 580
 tion in the prisons, together with the deficiencies in medical care, as "alarming."
 Both the IACHR and the former U.N. Special Rapporteur on Cuba, as well as other
 human rights monitoring organizations, reported the widespread incidence in pris-
 ons of tuberculosis, scabies, hepatitis, parasitic infections, and malnutrition.
 Prison guards and state security officials also subjected human rights and pro-
 democracy activists to threats of physical violence; systematic psychological intuni-
 dation; and with detention or imprisonment in cells with common and violent crimi-
 nals, aggressive homosexuals, or state security agents posing as prisoners. Political
 prisoners are required to comply with the rules for common criminals and often are
 punished severely if they refuse. Detainees and prisoners often are subjected to re-
 peated, vigorous interrogations designed to coerce them into signing incriminating
 statements, to force collaboration with authorities, or to intimidate victims.
 The four members of. the internal dissident working group (economist Martha
 Beatriz Roque, economist and former military officer Vladimiro Roca, professor Felix
 Bonne, and lawyer Renee Gomez Manzano) were allowed access to a priest only
 after frequent requests and letters to prison, civil, and religious authorities. Roca's
 request for baptism was granted only after direct appeals to Cuban Cardinal Jaime
 Ortega and the Vatican. The authorities in Manto Negro women's prison placed
 Roque in a cell with other prisoners convicted of violent crimes. These inmates, in
 collusion with the authorities, repeatedly threatened Roque with violence and
 sought to provoke her. After nearly a year of requesting medical attention, Roque
 was transferred temporarily in July to the Carlos Finlay hospital for examination
 and treatment, but was placed in a room with a suicide-prone, mentally disturbed,
 convicted prisoner. Prison authorities also encouraged other prisoners to threaten
 Roque with violence.
 On May 25, political prisoner Jorge Luis Garcia Perez, also known as "Antunez,"
 reportedly began a 23-day hunger strike at the Guantanamo provincial prison to
 press his demands for medical attention and access to religious counsel as well as
 a transfer to a prison closer to his family in Villa Clara, over 300 miles away. Garcia
 Perez ended the strike after prison officials agreed to allow a priest to visit him.
 In October the authorities transferred Garcia Perez to the Nieves Morejon prison
 in Sancti Spiritus province. While this prison is cioser to his family, the authorities
 at the new prison continued to harass him severely and also beat him. In 1995 Gar-
 cia Perez had founded the Pedro Luis Boitel political prisoner organization, named
 for a political prisoner who died as a result of a hunger strike in 1972.
 In Cienfuegos prison, the authorities repeatedly refused to allow priests access to
 political prisoners, such as Benito Fojaco, even though the priests occasionally were
 allowed to enter the prison.
 The Government does not permit independent monitoring of prison conditions by
 international or national human rights monitoring groups. The Government has re-
 fused prison visits by the International Commission of the Red Cross since 1989 and
 continued to refuse requests to renew such visits. Nonetheless, human rights activ-
 ists continued to seek information on conditions inside jails despite the risks to
 themselves and to their prison sources. There were reports of a confidential visit to
 prisons by a delegation from the Latin American Parliament in September. One de-
 tainee reported being moved from cell to cell during the visit, apparently in order
 to keep the detainee from speaking with the visitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrest and detention continued
 to be problems. The Law of Penal Procedures requires poice to file formal charges
 and either release a detainee or bring the case before a prosecutor within 96 hours
 of arrest. It also requires the authorities to provide suspects with access to a lawyer
 within 7 days of arrest. However, the Constitution states that all legally recognized
 civil liberties can be denied to anyone who actively opposes the "decision of the
 Cuban people to build socialism." The authorities invoke this sweeping authority to
 deny due process to those detained on purported state security grounds.
 The authorities routinely engage in arbitrary arrest and detention of human
 rights advocates, subjecting them to interrogations, threats, and degrading treat-
 ment and conditions for hours or days at a time.
 In June state security agents detained human rights activisit Juan Francisco
 Fernandez Gomez and held him for 57 days (see Section l.f). On October 1, police
 detained independent journalist Manuel Antonio Gonzales on charges of disrespect
 for allegedly insulting Fidel Castro. His family was subjected to a violent act of re-
 pudiation (see Section l.c.).
 The Government also arbitrarily arrested and detained independent journalists
 (see Section 2.a.) and demonstrators. In April the authorities temporarily detained
 the president of an independent farmers' association (see Section 2.b.). The Govern-
 ment also placed under preventive detention activists who attempted to celebrate
 religious events (see Section 2.c.).
 
 
 The four members of the internal dissident working group remained detained
 without trial since July 1997, when they were arrested for expressing peacefully
 their disagreement with the Government. In September prosecutors issued their
 provisional conclusions in the State's 14-month investigation of the four dissidents,
 and recommended that they be charged with "other acts against the security of the
 State in relation to the crime of sedition." They recommended sentences of 6 years
 for Roca and 5 years for Roque, Gomez Manzano, and Bonne. In 1997 the group had
 sought support from the international community for its concept of peaceful dissent
 from the Government's policies. It publicly distributed a paper, "The Homeland Be-
 longs to All," which presented a moderate response to the platform released by the
 Communist Party for its Fifth Party Congress. The working group also made a pub-
 lic appeal to citizens to abstain from participating in national elections. It is legal
 for Cubans to refrain from voting.
 The Penal Code includes the concept of "dangerousness," defined as the "special
 proclivity of a person to commit crimes, demonstrated by his conduct in manifest
 contradiction of socialist norms." If the police decide that a person exhibits signs of
 dangerousness, they may bring the offender before a court or subject him to "ther-
 apy" or "political reeducation." Government authorities regularly threaten prosecu-
 tion under this article. Both the United Nations Human Rights Commission
 (UNHRC) and the IACHR have criticized this concept for its subjectivity, the sum-
 mary nature of the judicial proceedings employed, the lack of legal safeguards, and
 the political considerations behind its application. According to the IACHR, "the spe-
 cial inclination to commit crimes referred to in the Cuban Criminal Cede amounts
 to a subjective criterion used by the Government to justify violations of the rights
 to individual freedom and due process of persons whose sole crime has been an incli-
 nation to hold a view different from the official view." In December a Havana mu-
 nicipal court sentenced dissident Lazaro Constantin to 4 years in jail for dangerous-
 ness and public disorder. The Government temporarily detained several other dis-
 sidents to prevent them from going to the court building on the day of Constantin's
 trial. They were released within 24 to 48 hours.
 The Government also used exile as a tool for controlling and eliminating the inter-
 nal opposition. Amnesty International has noted that the Government had changed
 its tactics in dealing with human rights advocates, and "rather than arresting them
 and bringing them to trial, the tendency was to repeatedly detain them for short
 periods and threaten them with imprisonment unless they gave up their activities
 or left the country." The Government used these incremental aggressive tactics to
 compel Heriberto Leyva, in June, and Radames Garcia de la Vega, in September
 (both members of the Youth for Democracy movement), among others, to leave the
 country.
 The Government also has pressured imprisoned human rights activists and politi-
 cal prisoners to apply for emigration and regularly conditioned their release on ac-
 ceptance of exile. In February in response to an appeal by the Vatican for clemency
 following the Pope's visit, the Government agreed to release 300 prisoners, 99 of
 whom were political prisoners. Of the latter group, 19 prisoners were required to
 go into exile. Canada accepted 17 of these persons, including long-term political pris-
 oner Omar del Pozo Marrero. The Church had requested that all those released be
 allowed to remain and resume their activities in Cuba. On several occasions, state
 security officers facilitated passes to prisoners to come to Havana for the express
 purpose of initiating exit procedures with foreign diplomatic missions.
 Amnesty International has expressed "particular concern" about the Government's
 practice of threatening to charge, try, and imprison human rights advocates and
 independent journalists prior to arrest or sentencing if they did not leave the coun-
 try. According to Amnesty International, this practice "effectively prevents those
 concerned from being able to act in public life in their own country."
 The Government continued to harass dissident leader Leonel Morejon Almagro in
 an effort to force him to leave the country. Morejon alleged government coercion of
 his wife's family, who share their home, which has had a negative impact on his
 infant daughter and wife.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-Although the Constitution provides for independ-
 ent courts, it explicitly subordinates them to the National Assembly of the People's
 Power and the Council Df State, which is headed by Fidel Castro. The ANPP and
 its lower level counterparts choose all judges. The subordination of the courts to the
 Communist Party, which the Constitution designates as "uperior directive force of
 the society and the State," further compromises the judiciary's independence.
 Civil courts exist at municipal, provincial, and supreme court levels. Panels com-
 posed of a mix of professionally certified and lay judges preside over them. Military
 tribunals assume jurisdiction for certain counterrevolutionary cases.
 
 
 582
 The law and trial practices do not meet international standards for fair public
 trials. Almost all cases are tried in less than a day; there are no jury trials. While
 most trials are public, trials are closed when state security allegedly is involved.
 Prosecutors may introduce testimony from a CDR member as to the revolutionary
 background of a defendant, which may contribute to either a longer or shorter sen-
 tence. The law recognizes the right of appeal in municipal courts but limits it in
 provincial courts to cases such as those involving maximum prison terms or the
 death penalty. Appeals in death penalty cases are automatic. The death penalty
 must ultimately be affirmed by the Council of State.
 Criteria for presenting evidence, especially in cases of human rights advocates,
 are arbitrary and discriminatory. Often the sole evidence provided, particularly in
 political cases, is the defendant's confession, usually obtalned under duress and
 without the legal advice or knowledge of a defense lawyer. The authorities regularly
 deny defendants access to their lawyers until the day of the trial. Several dissidents
 who have served prison terms reported that they were tried and sentenced without
 counsel and were not allowed to speak on their own behalf. Amnesjt International
 has concluded that "trials in all cases fall far short of internationa standards .for
 a fair trial."
 The law provides the accused with the right to an attorney, but the control that
 the Government exerts over the livelihood of members of the state-controlled law-
 yers collectives--especially when they defend persons accused of state security
 crimes--copromises their ability to represent  ients.Attor  e have reported re-
 luctance to dndthose charged in political cases due to feyso eprdzn      hi
 own careers
 Human rights monitoring groups inside the country estimate that the number of
 political prisoners in Havana stands at 850 to 400 persons. The authorities have im-
 prisoned such persons on charges such as disseminating enemy propaganda, illicit
 association, contempt for the authorities (usually for criticizing Fidel1Castro), clan-
 destine printing, or the broad charge of rebellion, ofen brought against advocates
 of peacel democratic change. Other estimates by human rights activists inside and
 outside the country put the number as high as 1,600 persons. Among those, con-
 victed on political charges were independent journalist and prodemocracy activist
 Reinaldo Alfaro Garcia on August 28 for "dissemination of false news;" Democratic
 Solidarity Party (PSD) vice delegate Cecffio Monteagudo Sanchez on February 13 for
 enemy propaganda; independent journalist Juan Carlos Recio Martinez, also on Feb-
 ruary 13, for failing to denounce Monteagudo to the authorities; and Julio Cesar
 Coizeau Rizo, member of the Geraldo Gonzalez Ex-Political Prisoners Club, for dis-
 respect (see Section 2.a.). Also, in March a Cienfuegos court convicted five members
 of the Pro Human Rights Party of Cuba-Israel Garcia Hidalgo, Benito Fojaca Iser,
 Angel Nicolas Gonzalo, Jose Ramon Lopez Filgueira, and Reynaldo Sardnas
 Delgado-of "other acts against state security." Garcia and Fojaca each were sen-
 tenced to two years in prison, Filgueira to 1 year, and Gonzalo and Sardinas to 1
 year in a labor camp. In December dissident Lazaro Constantin was sentenced for
 dangerousness and public disorder (see Section 1.d.).
 In 1997. the Government tried and sentenced a group of human rights activists
 who had held a prolonged fast to protest the jailing of Daula Carpio Matas. The
 court handed out sentences ranging from 18 months in prison to 1 year of house
 arrest. Daula Carpio, ileana Pesnlver, and Lilian Meneses were serving terms in
 Guamajal women's prison and reported continued health problems associated with
 their prolonged fast and also constant harassment from inmates acting on behalf of
 the prison authorities. Ivan Leias was held at the Pre prison in Santa Clara where
 he also reported being harassed by inmates. Prison authorities reportedly moved
 him from the hosital ward where he was being treated for inflammation of internal
 organs before his medical condition had been fully treated. Jose Antonio Alvarada
 was in Guajamal men's prison, where he claimed that he had been subjected to
 blackmail attempts and attempts to suggest that he is a homosexual. Jose Manuel
 Yera was held at the Pendlente prison in Santa Clara and also claimed harassment
 for his dissident views by prison inmates and officials. Rosana Carpio was sentenced
 to 18 months in jail but placed under house arrest because she was pregnant.
 The number of political prisoners fell in 1998, particularly after the release of 99
 of these prisoners beginning in February as part of the Government's response to
 an appeal by Pope John Paul II for clemency. The Government, in a rare public
 statement following the Pope's visit, implicitly admitted that Cuba held political
 prisoners, saying that there were 70 counterrevolutionary prisoners that it would
 never release. The Government also would notrelease some19 prisoners unless
 they went into exile; 17 were accepted by Canada (see Section 1.d.). On November
 20, the Government released Jesus Chamber Ramirz, who was serving a 10-year
 sentence for enemy propaganda and disrespect against authority, and Dr. Dessy
 
 
 583
 Mendoza, who received an 8-year sentence in 1997 for enemy propaganda, after an
 appeal on their behalf by the Spanish Government. The authorities effectively condi-
 tioned the release of Chamber and Mendoza on their departure from the country,
 and by year's end both had left for Spain.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Al-
 though the Constitution provides for the inviolability of a citizen's home and cor-
 respondence, official surveillance of private and family affairs by government-con-
 trolled mass organization, such as the CDR's, remains one of the most pervasive
 and repressive features of Cuban life. The State has assumed the right to interfere
 in the lves of citizens, even those who do not actively oppose the Government and
 its practices. The mass organizations' ostensible purpose is to "improve the citi-
 zenry," but in fact their goal is to discover and discourage nonconformity. Citizen
 participation in these mass organizations has declined; the economic crisis has both
 reduced the Government's ability to provide material incentives for their participa-
 tion and forced many persons to engage in black market activities, which the mass
 orgaizations are supposed to report to the authorities.
 The authorities utilize a wide range of social controls. The Interior Ministry em-
 ploys an intricate system of informants and block committees (the CDR's) to monitor
 and control public opinion. While less capable than in the past, CDR's continue to
 report on suspicious activity, including conspicuous consumption; unauthorized
 meetings, including those with foreigners; and defiant attitudes toward the Govern-
 ment and the revolution.
 The Department of State Security often reads international correspondence and
 monitors overseas telephone calls and conversations with- foreigners. The Govern-
 ment controls all access to the Internet, and all electronic mail messages are subject
 to censorship. Citizens do not have the right to receive publications from abroad,
 although newsstands in foreigners-only hotels and outside certain hard currency
 stores sell foreign newspapers and magazines. The Government continued to jam
 the U.S.-operated Radio Marti and Television Marti. Radio Marti broadcasts gen-
 erally overcame the jamming attempts on shortwave bands, but its medium wave
 transmissions are blocked completely in Havana. The Government generally suc-
 ceeded in jamming Television Marti transmissions. Security agents subjected dis-
 sidents, foreign diplomats, and journalists to harassment and surveillance, including
 electronic surveillance.
 On June 10, state security agents detained veteran human rights activist Juan
 Francisco Fernandez Gomez at his home in Villa Clara and held him without
 charges for 57 days at the state security facility of Villa Marista in Havana after
 he received an overseas telephone call. They also questioned the 63-year-old activist
 about persons with whom he met during an earlier trip to the United States. At
 year's end, Fernandez was under house arrest pending further investigations.
 The authorities regularly search people and their homes, without probable cause,
 to intimidate and harass them. State security agents searched the homes of hun-
 dreds of human rights advocates and independent journalists, seizing typewriters,
 personal and organizational documents, books, and foreign newspapers. The au-
 thorities harass and target acts of repudiation at both dissidents and their family
 members. At times those taking part in such acts of repudiation invade and damage
 homes, as well as physically attack occupants (see Section 1.c.). Friends and rel-
 atives of independent journalists also are subjected to harassment (see Sections 1.c.
 and 2.a.).
 The authorities regularly detained human rights advocates after they visited for-
 eign diplomatic missions, confiscated their written reports of human rights abuses,
 and seized copies of foreign newspapers and other informational material, including
 copies of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). In September anti-
 abortion activist Dr. Elias Biscet was harassed during a Mass in Havana and briefly
 detained by state security personnel, who confiscated copies of the UDHR he had
 been carrying. Also in September, independent journalist Efren Martinez was evict-
 ed from his rented rooms (see Section 2.a.).
 There were numerous credible reports of forced evictions of squatters and resi-
 dents who lacked official permission to reside in Havana (see Section 5).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government does not allow criticism of the
 revolution or its leaders. Laws against antigovernment propaganda, graffiti, and dis-
 respect of officials carry penalties of from 3 months to 1 year in prison. If President
 Castro or members of the National Assembly or Council of State are the objects of
 criticism, the sentence can be extended to 3 years. Charges of disseminating enemy
 propaganda (which includes merely expressing opinions at odds with those of the
 Government) can bring sentences of up to 14 years. Local CDR's inhibit freedom of
 
 
 584
 speech by monitoring and reporting dissent or criticism. Police and state security
 officials regularly harassed, threatened, and otherwise abused human rights advo-
 cates in- public and private as a means of intimidation and control
 On February 13, a Santa Clara court sentenced Cecilio Monteagudo Sanchez, a
 PSD vice delegate, to 4 years' imprisonment for dissemination of enemy propaganda.
 Monteagudo was prosecuted for writing a document calling on citizens to abstain
 from voting. The court also sentenced Juan Carlos Recio Martinez, an independent
 journalist with the Cuba Press Agency who had been asked to type the document,
 to I year in a labor cam p for failing to denounce Monteagudo. Recio unsuccessfully
 appealed the sentence. On April 24, a Santiago court found Julio Cesar Coizeau
 Rizo, a member of the Geraldo Gonzalez ex-Political Prisoners Club, guilty of dis-
 respect for authority for posting antigovernment flyers and sentenced him to 3
 years' imprisonment.
 The Constitution states that print and electronic media are state property and
 "cannot become in any case private property." The Communist Party controls all
 media-except a few small church-run publications that nevertheless are watched
 closely and denied access to mass printing equipment-as a means to indoctrinate
 the public. All media must operate under party guidelines and reflect government
 views. The Government attempts to shape media coverage to such a degree that it
 not only exerted increased pressure on domestic journalists, but also sought to pres-
 sure groups nominally outside the official realm of control, such as visiting inter-
 national correspondents.
 The Inter-American Press Association (IAPA) reported that the Government de-
 nied visas to about 80 foreign newsmen before the Pope's visit on the grounds that
 they earlier had been critical of the Government in their news coverage. A foreign
 freelance journalist who met with two independent journalists in their home in
 Santiago de Cuba was warned against contact with his hosts, who state security
 agents claimed were "terrorists" and "murderers." Security officials then visited his
 hosts, Mirna Riveron and Manuel del Rio, told them that the reporter was an intel-
 ligence agent, and warned them that they could be put in jail for 20 years for talk-
 ing to him. Foreign journalists claimed that surveillance by the Government has be-
 come more intense and overt outside of Havana.
 On December 10 in a Havana park, members of a group of Communist Party sup-
 porters grabbed the camera of a foreign journalist and destroyed it. The journalist
 was among foreign camera crews that had arrived at the park and tried to interview
 an unidentified dissident who was trying to commemorate the Fiftieth Anniversary
 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The dissident then was assaulted
 and dragged away by the party supporters (see Section 2.b.). State security officers
 moved in to stop the party supporters from attacking the journalist further. The
 crowd then surrounded the other photojournalists and insisted on being filmed
 chanting slogans in support of President Castro and against the foreign media pres-
 ence.
 The Government continued to jam the U.S.-operated Radio Marti and Television
 Marti (see Section 1.f.).
 On November 13, the Associated Press announced that the Government had au-
 thorized it to open a bureau in Havana.
 The temporary suspensions of official media representatives highlighted the dif-
 ficult ideological tightrope that government reporters and editors must walk. Ac-
 cording to the IAPA, newscaster Raquel Mayedo and his crew on the show
 "Contacto" were sanctioned in February for "actions contrary to revolutionary prin-
 ciples." Local independent journalists reported that in June, television journalist
 Guillermo Morales of Havana City Television reportedly was given a 15-day suspen-
 sion and forced to recant publicly before his fellow workers on-air criticisms that he
 made of President Castro.
 The Government continued to subject independent journalists to internal travel
 bans, arbitrary and periodic (overnight or longer) detentions, acts of repudiation (see
 Section 1.c.), harassment of friends and relatives, seizures of written manuals, com-
 puters, office and photographic equipment, and repeated threats of prolonged im-
 prisonment. Several independent journalists were expelled from the country or har-
 assed during the first half of the year, while there nevertheless was general talk
 of a lull in harassment after the Pope's visit in January. This came to an abrupt
 end with the sentencing of Reinaldo Alfaro Garcia in August, and the detentions of
 many independent journalists, along with dissidents, that followed (see Section 1.d.).
 The independent journalists appeared to be a particular focus of Government repres-
 sion.
 On August 28, the State sentenced independent journalist and prodemocracy ac-
 tivist Reinaldo Alfaro Garcia to 3years in prison for "dissemination of false news
 against international peace." The Government alleged that Alfaro had misreported
 
 
 stories regarding the suspicious death of a soldier in 1994 and a separate incident
 involving the beating of a woman by authorities. With the exception of Alfaro's im-
 mediate family, neither international journalists, foreign diplomats, nor members of
 the public were allowed into the courtroom, which the Government had packed with
 its own personnel. Alfaro had been held for 16 months prior to the 5-hour trial. At
 the end of the trial, Alfaro's family members were asked to leave the courtroom and
 were told that they could wait to see him leave for prison at a side door to the court-
 house. State security personnel then spirited Alfaro out another door and 'delib-
 erately drove him in a car behind where his family was standing. On discovering
 the Government's effort to deceive the Alfaro family, some 40 prodemocracy activists
 chased after the vehicle and staged an impromptu public demonstration to protest
 the situation. The Government later attempted to blame the disturbance on agita-
 tion by a foreign diplomat, despite the presence of other diplomats and journalists
 who witnessed the incident.
 Journalists Maria de los Angeles Gonzalez and Luis Lopez Prendes were detained
 in September, ostensibly to prevent them from starting a demonstration at the pro-
 cession of the Virgin of Charity on September 8 in Havana. The authorities detained
 Juan Antonio Sanchez in Havana in connection with the same event and took him
 to Pinar del Rio province where they held him for 6 days. Raul Rivero's telephone
 service was cut after he was named Cuban vice-president of the IAPA Committee
 on Freedom of the Press. State security officials threatened Lopez Prendes with de-
 tention because of an article he wrote on corruption of the local government in the
 Havana municipality of Guanabo; Lopez Prendes' photographer was beaten in his
 own front yard, reportedly by a state security member, and his camera was taken.
 Independent journalist Mario Viera was scheduled to go on trial on November 27
 for allegedly defaming Jose Dionisio Peraza Chapeau, head of the Ministry of For-
 eign Affairs Legal Department, in a commentary Viera wrote that appeared on the
 Internet in June. The court was asked to sentence Viera to 1 year in prison for defa-
 mation and an additional 6 months for refusing to retract his article. However, fol-
 lowing a disturbance outside the court building in which progovernment rapid re-
 sponse brigade members assaulted a group of prodemocracy activists who had gath-
 ered to show support for Viera (see Sections 1.b. and 2.b.), the trial was postponed
 until further notice.
 Family members have been the object of harassment by state security agents
 when pressure on independent journalists has not been successful in making them
 abandon their work or leave the country. Manzanillo journalist Mirta Leyva accept-
 ed refugee status from Spain and departed with her family in September, after her
 husband was jailed and lost his job. This occurred after stones and animal blood
 had been thrown at their house for months at night, which be an to have a serious,
 noticeable effect on the health and well-being of her two sma  children. Journalist
 Isaura Ortega has been fighting battles in court against her former husband for cus-
 tody of her 5-year-old son; her ex-husband charged that her antirevolutionary arti-
 cles proved that she is insane.
 In October the family of independent journalist Manuel Antonio Gonzalez was the
 target of an act of repudiation staged by local authorities in San German, Holguin
 province (see Section 1.c.).
 In September independent journalist Efren Martinez Pulgaron was evicted from
 his rented rooms after his landlord was approached by state security members. Sev-
 eral subsequent attempts to fimd a rental home for himself and his elderly mother
 were unsuccessful, again, after security service personnel visited the would-be land-
 lords.
 Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, IAPA, Reporters without Borders,
 and the Committee to Protect Journalists repeatedly called international attention
 to the Government's continued practice of detaining independent journalists -and
 others simply for exercising their right to free speech.
 The Government rigorously monitored other forms of expression and often ar-
 rested persons for the crimes of disseminating enemy propaganda and false news.
 In the Government's view, enemy propaganda includes materials such as the Uni-
 versal Declaration of Human Rights, international reports of human rights viola-
 tions, and mainstream foreign newspapers and magazines.
 The Government prohibits all diplomatic missions in Havana from printing or dis-
 tributing ublications, particularly newspapers and newspaper clippings, unless
 those publcations deal -exclusively with conditions in the mission's home country
 and receive prior government approval. Many missions do not accept the validity of
 this requirement, but the Government's threats to expel embassy officers who pro-
 vide published materials to Cubans have had a chilling effect on many missions.
 In 1996, the Government passed the "Cuban Dignity and Sovereignty Law," which
 proscribes citizens from providing any information to any representatives of the U.S.
 
 
 586
 Government, or seeking any information from them, that might be used directly or
 indirectly in the application of U.S. legislation. This includes accepting or distribut-
 ing any publications, documents, or other material, from any origin, which the au-
 thorities might interpret as facilitating implementation of such legislation. Although
 no one has been charged with viola   this law, it has raised concern among many
 independent journalists.
 Distribution of information continues to be tightly controlled. During the Pope's
 visit, the Church's ability to distribute even approved information pamphlets was
 constricted by its lack o access  rinting presses. Access to the Internet largely
 is limited to ceritain government offices and foregners. A few citizens can maintain
 accounts to sonde limited electronic message services, strictly controlled by the Inte-
 rior Ministry.
 The Government circumscribes artistic, literary, and academic freedoms, and re-
 peatedly has emphasized the importance of reinforcing revolutionary ideology and
 discipline over any freedom of expression. The educational system teaches that the
 State's interests have precedence over all other commitments. Academics and other
 government officials are prohibited from meeting with some diplomats in Havana
 without prior approval from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry of Edu-
 cation requires teachers to evaluate students' ideological character and that of the
 students' parents, and note it in records that students carry throughout their school-
 ing. These reports directly affect the students' future educational and career pros-
 pects. As a matter of policy, the Government demands that teaching materials for
 courses such as mathematics or literature have an ideological content.
 Government efforts to undermine dissidents included denying them advanced edu-
 cation and professional opportunities. Officials at the University of Havana expelled
 prodemocracy activist'Leonardo Ramon Cavo in June for "holding political ideas dif-
 ferent from those of the State." Calvo was expelled in accordance with the 1984 Dis-
 ciplinary Regulations for Students in Higher Education, which allow for a student
 to be expelled for "very serious violations, including 'maintaining an attitude mani-
 festly contrary to our revolutionary process.'" The same measure was used to expel
 another student for not voting in national elections (see Section 3.). President Castro
 has stated publicly that the universities are available only for those-who share his
 revolutionary beliefs.
 b. Freedom of Peaceul Assembly and Association.-Although the Constitution
 grants limited rights of assembly and association, these rights are subject to the re-
 quirement that they may not be "exercised against the existence and objectives of
 socialist State." The law punishes any unauthorized assembly of more than
 three persons, including those for private religious services in a private home, by
 up to 3 months in prison and a fine. The authorities selectively enforce this prohibi-
 tion and often use it as a legal pretext to harass and imprison human rights advo-
 cates.
 The Government selectively continued to authorize the Catholic Church to hold
 outdoor processions at specific locations on important feast days during the year. It
 also authorized other denominations to hold a few public events. The Seventh Day
 Adventists held a mass baptism in February and the Eastern Baptist Convention
 was permitted to rent a government-owned theater for an annual meeting (see Sec-
 tion 2.c.). However, requests for other processions and events were routinely and ar-
 bitrarily denied. The Government permitted a procession in connection with masses
 in celebration of the feast day on September 8 of Our Lady of Charity in Havana
 for the first time in more than 3 decades.
 On February 8, officials detained 10 members of the Martiana Civic League out-
 side a church following Mass when they attempted to walk to the Havana water-
 front to commemorate the victims of the February 24, 1996 shootdown of 2 civilian
 aircraft over international airspace by the Cuban air force. The 10 were harassed,
 threatened, and subsequently released. On November 27, approximately 100
 progovement rapid response brigade members provoked and then assaulted a
 slightly smaller group of predemocracy activists who had assembled peacefully out-
 side Havana's provincial tribunal building to show support for independent journal-
 ist Mario Viera (see Section 2.a.). The progovernment group began taunting and
 shoving Viera supporters as well as some foreign journalists who were present to
 cover Viera's scheduled trial. As the confrontation escalated, riot police moved
 against the Viera supporters, in some cases beating and kicking them (see Section
 1.c.). Dissidents reported that at least seven persons were arrested.
 The authorities have never approved a public meeting by a human rights group.
 The Government briefly detained about a dozen prodemocracy activists in different
 parts of the country in order to prevent public events that marked the -anniversary
 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Human rights monitors reported
 that in December, state security officers went to the homes of at least 10 dissidents
 
 
 587
 known to have participated in previous public demonstrations and warned them
 against taking part in any public events on December 10 to mark the 50th anniver-
 sary of the UDHR. In Havana officials threatened dissidents planning a related
 event at the home of a prodemocracy activist with preventive arrest. State security
 officers took activist  aros ruz to a Havana mental hospital for observation on
 December 4, after she made known her intention to participate in a reading of the
 UDHR at a Havana park (see Section 1.c.). The hospital released her on December
 14. State security agents detained antiabortion activist Dr. Elias Biscet several
 times in early December and warned him to cancel a planned public reading of the
 UDHR on December 10 at a park in his neighborhood. A group of several hundred
 Communist Party members assembled at the same park on December 10, ostensibly
 in support of the Congress of the Young Communist Union. Eyewitnesses reported
 that a person in the crowd, who was said to be holding copies of the UDHR, began
 shouting human rights slogans and was attacked by the Party supporters, who
 knocked him down and dragged him to a neighboring street. According to the wit-
 nesses, the progovernment demonstrators also assaulted foreign journalists who
 tried to follow the group (see Section 2.a.).
 In April State Security officials temporarily detained the president of an inde-
 pendent farmers' association in Santiago and prevented about 30 members of the
 association from traveling to the site of a planned meeting.
 The Government denies citizens the freedom of association. The Penal Code spe-
 cifically outlaws "illegal or unrecognized groups." The Ministry of Justice, in con-
 sultation with the Interior Ministry, decides whether to give organizations legal rec-
 ognition. The authorities have never approved the existence of a human rights
 group.
 Along with recognized churches, the Roman Catholic humanitarian organization
 Caritas, Masons, small human rights groups, and a number of nascent fraternal or
 professional organizations are the only associations outside the control or influence
 of the State, the Communist Party, and their mass organizations. With the excep-
 tion of the Masons, who have been established in the country for more than a cen-
 try, the authorities continue to ignore these groups' applications for legal recogni-
 tion, thereby subjecting members to potential charges of illegal association. All other
 legally recognized "nongovernmental" groups are at least nominally affiliated with,
 or controlled by, the Government.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-In recent years, the Government has eased the harsher
 aspects of its repression of religious freedom. In 1991 it allowed religious adherents
 to join the Communist Party. In 1992 it amended the Constitution to prohibit reli-
 gious discrimination and removed references to "scientific materialism," i.e., athe-
 ism, as the basis for the Cuban State. Nevertheless, the State prohibits members
 of the armed forces from allowing anyone in their household to observe religious
 practices, except elderly relatives if their religious beliefs do not influence other
 family members and are not "damaging to the revolution."
 On January 21-25, Pope John Paul II made a historic trip to Cuba. The Pope cele-
 brated public Masses in front of hundreds of thousands of persons in Havana, Villa
 Clara, Camaguey, and Santiago de Cuba, which were televised nationally. Persons
 attending-the Mass in Havana chanted "freedom," and the Pope made an a peal for
 the "world to open up to Cuba" and for "Cuba to open up to the world." fn his 11
 discourses while in the country, the Pope emphasized the need to allow fundamental
 freedoms, to respect human rights, and to foster the development of independent
 civil society.
 On May 30, the country's Catholic bishops publicly appealed to the Government
 to recognize the Church's role in civil society and the family, as well as in the tem-
 poral areas of work, the economy, the arts, sports, and the scientific and technical
 worlds. The Government continued to limit strictly the Church's access to the media
 and refused to allow the Church to have a legal independent printing capability. It
 maintained its prohibition against the establishment of religiously affiliated schools.
 However, in September local government authorities allowed the Catholic Church
 to hold an outdoor procession to mark the feast day of Our Lady of Charity in Ha-
 vana for the first time since 1961. State security personnel openly and heavily har-
 assed diplomats during this ceremony. The Cardinal also was allowed a 10-minute
 address on the national classical music station.
 On December 1, the Government announced in a politburo declaration that hence-
 forth citizens would be allowed to celebrate Christmas as an official holiday. (The
 holiday had been cancelled, ostensibly to spur the sugar harvest, in 1969, and re-
 stored for 1997 as part of the preparations for the Pope's visit.) The authorities
 again permitted the Cardinal to speak briefly on national media to commemorate
 Christmas. However, despite the Government's decision to allow citizens to celebrate
 
 
 Christmas as a-national holiday, it also maintained a December 1995 decree prohib-
 iting nativity scenes in public buildings.
 The Government allowed some foreign priests and nuns to enter the country, but
 applications of many other priests and religious workers remained pending at year's
 end. The Government also pressured two foreign Catholic priests to leave the coun-
 try. In one case, American priest Patrick Sullivan left Cuba after Communist Party
 officials objected to his displaying the Universal Declaration of Human Rights inside
 his church, allowing parishioners to elect the church board members, and maintain-
 ing contacts with foreign diplomats. Father Sullivan publicly stated that he did not
 leave of his own volition. In August the authorities at Havana's international air-
 port briefly questioned two Italian members of a Catholic religious order who had
 traveled to Cuba to participate in a religious event and warned them not to return
 to the country.
 The Government continued to enforce a resolution that prevented any Cuban or
 joint enterprise (except those with specific authorization) from selling computers,
 facsimile machines, photocopiers, or other equipment to any church at other than
 the official-and exorbitant--retail prices.
 Students who profess a belief in religion continue to be stigmatized by other stu-
 dents and teachers and have been disciplined formally for bringing Bibles or other
 religious materials to school.
 The Government requires churches and other religious groups to register with the
 provincial Registry of Associations to obtain official recognition. The Government
 prohibits, with occasional exceptions, the construction of new churches, forcing
 many growing congregations to violate the law and meet in private homes. Govern-
 ment harassment of private houses of worship continued, with evangelical denomi-
 nations reporting evictions from houses used for these purposes. Officials of the
 Cuban Couhcil of Churches (CCC) reported that in 1997 the local government au-
 thorities had demolished two homes used as churches in the eastern provinces. In
 one case, provincial government authorities provided a replacement edifice.
 In September independent journalists reported that the Evenecer church in a
 home in Caibarien, Villa Clara province, was confiscated by local officials of the
 Communist Party's office of religious affairs and the Ministry of Interior. The au-
 thorities also have threatened to demolish homes used as churches in Havana prov-
 ince and have evicted congregations from other informal chapels.
 On October 22, the Government expelled a congregation affiliated with the West-
 ern Baptist Convention from a home used as a church in Encrucijada, Villa Clara
 grovince. The authorities confiscated the house and turned it over to the local
 ranch of the Union of Young Communists. Church leaders reported that this was
 the first such action taken against Baptists since the 1960's.
 The Government relaxed restrictions on some religious denominations. In Feb-
 ruary the president of the world association of Seventh Day Adventists was per-
 mitted to visit the country, where he celebrated an open air mass baptism in
 Matanzas province, presided over the reopening of a church in Havana, and met
 with government officials. Jehovah's Witnesses, once considered "active religious en-
 emies of the revolution," were allowed quietly to proselytize door-to-door, and they
 generally were not subjected to overt government harassment.
 CCC officials reported in June that the Council had received the Governmenfs
 permission to broadcast a monthly 15-minute program on a national classical music
 radio station, with the understanding that the program would not include material
 of a political character. The head of the CCC is a member of the government-con-
 trolled ANPP.
 State security officials visited some priests and pastors, prior to significant reli-
 gious events, ostensibly to warn them about dissidents, in an effort to sow discord
 and mistrust between the churches and peaceful prodemocracy activists. State secu-
 rity officers also regularly harassed human rights advocates who sought to attend
 religious services commemorating special feast days or before significant national
 days, including inside churches and during religious ceremonies.
 State security agents in Santiago de Cuba, Havana, and Pinar del Rio visited the
 homes of activists the night before and the morning of July 13-the fourth anniver-
 sary of the Cuban Coast Guard's sinking of the "13th of March" tugboat in which
 41 persons, including 21 children, died-to warn them against commemorating the
 incident. In Havana the police chased, beat, and detained 10 activists outside a
 church. State security officials also visited the homes of some of the family members
 of the victims of the incident and warned them against commemorating the tragedy.
 In connection with the September 8 celebration in honor of Our Lady of Charity,
 state security agents placed 16 activists under preventive detention for up to 72
 hours. State security and uniformed police also detained for about 5 hours some 20
 other dissidents who had gathered in the home of activist Isabel del Pino to prevent
 
 
 them from taking part in the religious event. Similar government harassment of
 human rights and opposition activists occurred during other religious anniversaries.
 Nevertheless, church attendance has grown in recent years in all denominations,
 and has substantially increased at Catholic Church services in the wake of the
 Pope's visit.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government kept tight restrictions on freedom of movement. The
 Government generally has not imposed legal restrictions on domestic travel, exce t
 for persons found to be HIV-positive, whom it initially restricts to sanitoriums for
 treatment and therapy before conditionally releasing them into the community.
 However, in recent years state security officials have forbidden human rights advo-
 cates and independent journalists from traveling outside their home provinces, and
 the Government also has sentenced others to internal exile. In April state security
 agents followed two dissident leaders, Leonel Morejon Almagro and Osvaldo Alfonso
 Maceo, from Havana to Santiago de Cuba, forced them to return to Havana, and
 told them that they could no longer travel outside of the capital. In April state secu-
 rity agents prevented members of an independent farmers association in Santiago
 from traveling to the site of a planned association meeting (see Section 2.b.). In De-
 cember agents detained prodemocracy activist Nestor Rodriguez Lobaina in Havana,
 forcibly took him to Santiago de Cuba under guard, and told him that he could not
 return to the capital.
 In 1997, the Council of Ministers approved Decree 217, aimed at stemming the
 flow of migration from the provinces to the capital city. Human rights observers
 noted that while the decree affected migration countrywide, the decree was targeted
 at individuals and families from the poor, predominantly black and mulatto eastern
 provinces. In March the government newspaper reported that Decree 217 had suc-
 ceeded in reducing the flow of persons to the capital city.
 The Government imposed some restrictions on both emigration and temporary for-
 eign travel. In October the Government denied exit permits to dissidents Elizardo
 Sanchez Cruz and Oswaldo Paya to attend conferences in Europe. The authorities
 later permitted Sanchez to travel outside the country in December to attend an
 event in Paris commemorating Human Rights Day, but refused to acknowledge
 Rodriguez Lobaina's requests to attend the same event. The Government allows the
 majority of persons who qualify for immigrant or refugee status in other countries
 to depart. However, in certain cases the authorities delay or deny exit permits, usu-
 ally without explanation. Some denials involve professionals who have t o emi-
 grate and whom the Government subsequently banned from working in their occu-
 pational field. The Government refused permission to others because it considers
 their cases sensitive for political or state security reasons. The Government also rou-
 tinely denies exit permits to young men approaching the age of military service, and
 until they reach the age of 27, even when it has authorized the rest of the family
 to leave. However, in most of those cases approved for migration to the United
 States under the September 1, 1994, U.S.-Cuban migration agreement, the appli-
 cants eventually receive exemption from obligatory service n are granted exit per-
 mits. The Government has a policy of denying exit permission -for several years to
 relatives of individuals who successfully have migrated illegally (e.g., merchant sea-
 men who have jumped ship overseas; sports figures who have defected while on tour
 abroad).
 Migrants who travel to the United States must pay $500 per adult, and $400 per
 child, plus airfare. These government fees for medical exam, passport, and exit
 visa-which must be paid in dollars-are equivalent to about 5 years of a profes-
 sional person's accumulated peso salary and represent a significant hardship, par-
 ticularly for political refugees who usually are marginalized and have no income. In
 1996, the Government agreed to allow 1,000 needy refugees to leave each year with
 reduced exit fees. However, after the first group of 1,000 in 1996, no further refu-
 gees have been accorded reduced fees. At the end of 1998, 306 approved refugees
 remained in Cuba because they were unable to pay government exit fees for them-
 selves and their families.
 The Penal Code provides for imprisonment from 1 to 3 years or a fine of $15 to
 $50 (300 to 1,000 pesos) for unauthorized departues by boat or raft. The office of
 the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has stated that it regards any
 sentence for simple illegal exit of over 1 year as harsh and excessive. Under the
 terms of the May 2, 1995, U.S.-Cuba migration accord, the Government agreed not
 to prosecute or retaliate against migrants returned from international or U.S. wa-
 ters, or from the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo, as a consequence of their attempt
 to emigrate illegally.
 In 1994, the Government eased restrictions on visits by, and repatriation of,
 Cuban emigrants. Citizens who establish residency abroad and who are in posses-
 
 
 590
 sion of government-issued "permits to reside abroad" may travel to Cuba without
 visas. The Government reduced the age of persons eligible to travel abroad from 20
 to 18 years and extended the -period for a temporary stay abroad from 6 to 11
 months. In November 1995, the Government announced that emigrants who are
 considered not to have engaged in "hostile actions" against the Government and who
 are not subject to criminal proceedings in their country of residence may apply at
 Cuban consulates for renewalile, 2-year multiple-entry travel authorizations.
 The Constitution provides for the granting of asylum to individuals persecuted
 "for their ideals or struggles for democratic rights against imperialism, fascism, colo-
 nialism, and neocolonialism; against discrimination and racism; for national libera-
 tion; for the rights of workers, peasants, and students, for their progressive political,
 scientific, artistic, and literary activities; for socialism and peace." The Government
 honors the principle of first asylum'and has provided it to a small number of per-
 sons. There was no information available on its use in 1998. Aqcording to the
 UNHCR, five foreign nationals sought asylum or refugee status from the Govern-
 ment in 1996. There were no reports of the forced return of persons to countries
 where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the legal right to change their government or to advocate
 change, and the Government has retaliated systematically against those who sought
 peaceful political change. The Constitution proscribes any political organization
 other than the Communist Party. While the Constitution provides for direct election
 of provincial, municipal, and National Assembly members, the candidates must be
 approved in advance by mass organizations controlled by the Government. In prac-
 tice, a small group of leaders, under the direction of President Castro, select the
 members of the highest policy-making bodies of the Communist Party-the Polit-
 buro and the Central Committee.
 The authorities tightly control the selection of candidates and all elections for gov-
 ernment and party positions. The candidacy committees are composed of members
 of government-controlled mass organizations such as the Confederation of Cuban
 Workers (CTC) and the CDR and are responsible for selecting candidates, whose
 names are then sent to municipal assemblies that select a single candidate for each
 regional seat in the ANPP. An opposition or independent candidate has never been
 allowed to run for national office.
 On January 11, the Government held national elections in which 601 candidates
 were approved to compete for the 601 seats of the National Assembly. The Govern-
 ment claimed that they were voted in by over 93 percent of the electorate, according
 to the official media. No candidates with views independent from or in opposition
 to the Government were allowed to run and no views contrary to the Government
 or the Communist Party were expressed in the government-controlled national
 media. The Government saturated the media and used government ministries, Com-
 munist Party organs, and mass organizations to urge voters to cast a "unified vote"
 where marking one box automatically selected all candidates on the ballot form. In
 practice, candidates for all offices were approved by the Communist Party. A small
 minority of candidates did not formally belong to the Communist Party. The Com-
 munist Party was the oniy political party allowed to participate in the elections.
 Although not a formal requirement, Communist Party membership is in fact a
 prerequisite for high-level official positions and professional advancement.
 In March the Government formally expelled Juan Francisco Pulido, a student at
 the university in Cienfuegos, for exercing his legal right not to vote in the Na-
 tional Assembly elections. A university employee officiaig at a voting station noted
 that Pulido did not vote and confronted him in his home that evening. Pulido was
 informed that he was expelled in accordance with the 1984 Disciplinary Regulations
 for Students in Higher Education for "maintaining an attitude manifestly contrary
 to our revolutionary process."
 The Government rejects any change judged incompatible with the revolution and
 ignored calls for democratic reform. Although President Castro signed the Declara-
 tion of Vina del Mar at the VI Ibero-American Summit in 1996, in which govern-
 ment leaders reaffirmed their commitment to democracy and political pluralism, the
 Government continued to oppose independent political activity on the ground that
 the Cuban system provides a "perfected" form of democracy and that pluralism ex-
 ists within the one-party structure.
 In 1996, the European Union (EU) suspended negotiations toward a cooperation
 agreement because of lack of progress toward political or economic reform. In De-
 cember of that year, the EU adopted the Common Position on Cuba, which is bind-
 ing on all member states and which is aimed at bringing about respect for political
 
 
 591
 rights. On June 29, the EU General Affairs Council issued a public statement on
 Cuba's request to participate as an observer in negotiations on the Lome Conven-
 tion. The Council noted that observership could contribute to the EU's objectives set
 out in the Common Position and recalled that "full cooperation with Cuba," includ-
 ing Cuban participation in the Lome Convention, would depend on "substantial
 progress on human rights, good governance, and political freedoms." The Council
 also explicitly called on the Government to release the four members of the internal
 dissident working group.
 Government leadership positions continue to be dominated by men. There are
 very few women or minorities in policymaking positions in the Government or the
 party. There are 2 women on the 24-member Politburo, 18 in the 150-member Cen-
 tral Committee, and 166 in the 601-seat ANPP. Although blacks and mulattos make
 up over half the population, they hold only six seats in the politburo.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not recognize any domestic human rights groups, or permit
 them to function legally. The Government subjects domestic human rights advocates
 to intense intimidation, harassment, and repression. In violation of its own statutes,
 the Government refuses to consider applications for legal recognition submitted by
 human rights monitoring groups.
 In its 1997 report the IACHR examined recent measures taken by the Govern-
 ment and found that they did not "comprise the bedrock of a substantive reform in
 the present political system" that would permit "the ideological and partisan plural-
 ism implicit in the wellspring from which a democratic system of government devel-
 ops." The IACHR recommended that the Government provide reasonable safeguards
 to prevent violations of human rights, unconditionally release political prisoners and
 those jailed for trying to leave the country, abolish the concept of dangerousness in
 the Penal Code, eliminate other legal restriction on basic freedoms, cease harassing
 human rights groups, and establish a separation of powers so that the judiciary
 would no longer be "subordinate to political power."
 The Government has steadfastly rejected international human rights monitoring.
 In 1992 Cuba's U.N. Representative stated that Cuba would not recognize the
 UNHRC mandate on Cuba and would not cooperate with the Special Rapporteur on
 Cuba, despite being a UNHRC member. This policy remained unchanged and the
 Government refused even to acknowledge requests by the Special Rapporteur to
 visit Cuba. In April the UNHRC did not renew the mandate of the Special
 Rapporteur, following as yet unfulfilled assertions by the Government that it would
 improve human rights practices if it was not under formal sanction from the
 UNHRC.
 In September the Government invited the U.N. Special Rapporteurs on Violence
 Against Women and on Mercenaries to visit. At year's end, these visits had not oc-
 curred.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Cuba is a multiracial society with a black and mixed race majority. The Constitu-
 tion forbids discrimination based on race, sex, or national origin, although evidence
 suggests that racial discrimination occurs often.
 Women.-Violent crime rarely is reported in the press, and there are no publicly
 available data regarding the incidence of domestic violence. The law establishes
 strict penalties for rape, and the Government appears to enforce the rape law. In
 October a female religious worker was abused sexually and murdered. The Govern-
 ment quickly ordered an investigation and arrested one suspect. Prostitution has in-
 creased greatly in the last few years; press reports indicate that tourists from var-
 ious countries visit specifically to patronize inexpensive prostitutes. Despite the
 Government's tight control over society in general, periodic government statements
 and efforts to crack down on prostitution seem to have had little lasting effect. Pros-
 titution is not illegal. Most observers believe that the Government tolerated or tac-
 itly encouraged prostitution to boost its tourist industry; however, later in the year,
 the Government began to pursue more active interdiction of prostitution.
 The Family Code states that women and men have equal rights and responsibil-
 ities regarding marriage, divorce, raising children, maintaining the home, and pur-
 suing a career. Women are subject to the same restrictions on property ownership
 as men. The maternity law provides 18 weeks of maternity leave and grants work-
 ing women preferential access to goods and services. About 40 percent of all women
 work, and they are well represented in the professions.

 Children.-:The Constitution provides that the Government protect "family, mater-
 nity, and matrimony." It also states that children, legitimate or not, have the same
 rights under the law and notes the duties of parents to protect them. Education is
 free and is grounded in Marxist ideology. State organizations and schools are
 charged with the "inteVral formation of children and youth." The national health
 care system covers all citizens.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse of children, other than in the area of pros-
 titution, where young girls form the bulk of the large number of prostitutes catering
 to foreign tourists. It is illegal for a child under 17 years of age to engage in pros-
 titution, but the police do not actively enforce this law.
 People With Disabilities.-The law prohibits discrimination- based on disability,
 and there have been few complaints of such discrimination. There are no laws that
 mandate accessibility to buildings for the disabled.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Many blacks -have benefited from access to
 basic education and medical care since the revolution, and much of the police force
 and army enlisted personnel is black. Nevertheless, there have been numerous re-
 ports of disproportionate police harassment of black youths. In 1997 there were nu-
 merous credible reports of forced evictions of squatters and residents lacking official
 permission to reside in Havana. The evictions, exacerbated by Decree 217 (see Sec-
 tion 2.d.), primarily targeted individuals and families from the eastern provinces,
 which are traditionally areas of black or mixed-race populations.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution gives priority to state or collective
 needs over individual choices regarding free association or provision of employment.
 The "demands of the economy and society" take precedence over individual workers'
 preferences. The law prohibits strikes; none are known to have occurred. Estab-
 hished official labor organizations have a mobilization function and do not act as
 trade unions, promote worker rights, or protect the right to strike. Such organiza-
 -tions are under the control of the State and the party, which are also the managers
 of the enterprises for which the laborers work.
 The Communist Party selects the leaders of the sole legal labor confederation, the
 Confederation of Cuban Workers, whose principal responsibility is to ensure that
 government production goals are met. Despite disclaimers in international forums,
 the Government explicitly prohibits independent unions and none are recognized.
 There has been no change since the 1992 International Labor Organization (ILO)
 finding that Cuba violated ILO norms on freedom of association and the right to
 organize. Those who attempt to engage in union activities face government persecu-
 tion. Workers can and have lost their jobs for their political beliefs, including their
 refusal to join the official union. Several small independent labor organizations have
 been created, but function without legal recognition and are unable to represent
 workers effectively and work on their behalf. The Government actively harasses
 these organizations. Human Rights Watch reported the detention of several leaders
 of independent labor organizations for periods ranging from several hours to 2 days.
 In September graffiti was painted on the home of independent labor activist Jose
 Orlando Bridon and garbage was piled outside his front door (see Section 1.c.).
 The CTC is a member of the Communist, formerly Soviet-dominated, World Fed-
 eration of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining does not
 exist. The State Committee for Work and Social Security (CETSS) sets wages and
 salaries for the state sector, which is almost the only employer in the country. Since
 all legal unions are government entities, antiunion discrimination by definition does
 not exist.
 There are no functioning export processing zones in Cuba, although the 1995 For-
 eign Investment Law (Law 77) authorizes the establishment of free trade zones and
 industrial parks. Law 77 continued to deny workers the right to contract directly
 with foreign companies investing in Cuba without special government permission.
 Although a few finms have managed to negotiate exceptions, the Government re-
 quires foreign investors to contract workers through state employment agencies,
 which are paid in foreign currency and, n turn, pay workers very low wages n
 Workers subcontracted by state employment agencies must meet certain po-
 litical qualifications. According ta Minister of Basic Industry Marcos Portal, the
 state employment agencies- consult with the party, the CTC, and the Union of Com-
 munist Youth to ensure that the workers chosen deserve to work in a joint enter-
 prise.
 -c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Neither the Constitution nor the
 Labor Code prohibit forced labor. The Government maintains correctional centers
 where it sends persons for crimes such as dangerousness. They are forced to work
 
 
 593
 
 on farms or building sites, usually with no pay and inadequate food. The authorities
 often imprison internees who do not cooperate.
 The Government employs special groups of workers, known as "microbrigades," on
 loan from other jobs, on special building projects. These microbrigades have in-
 creased importance in the Government's efforts to complete tourist and other prior-
 ity projects. Workers who refuse to volunteer for these jobs often risk discrimination
 or job loss. However, microbrigade workers reportedly receive priqrity consideration
 for apartments. The military channels some conscripts to the Youth Labor Army,
 where they serve their 2-year military service requirement working on farms that
 supply both the armed forces and the civilian population.
 The Government prohibits forced and bonded labor by children; however, the Gov-
 ernment requires children to work without compensation. All students over age 11
 are expected to devote 30 to 45 days of their summer vacation to farm work, labor-
 ing up to 8 hours per day. The Ministry of Agriculture uses "voluntary labor" by
 student work brigades extensively in the farming sector.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The legal
 minimum working age is 17 years. However, the Labor Code permits the employ-
 ment of 15- and 16-year-olds to obtain training or fill labor shortages. The law re-
 quires school attendance until the ninth grade, and this law generally is respected.
 The Government prohibits forced and bonded child labor, however, it requires chil-
 dren to work without compensation (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage varies by occupation and
 is set by the CETSS. The minimum monthly wage for a maid, for example, is $8.25
 (165 pesos); for a bilingual office clerk, $9.50 (190 pesos); and for a gardener $10.75
 (216 pesos). The Government supplements the minimum wage with free education
 and subsidized medical care (but reduces daily pay by 40 percent after the third day
 of being admitted to a hospital), housing, and some food-subsidized food is enough
 for about 1 week per month. However, even with these subsidies, the minimum
 wage does not provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. Corrup-
 tion and black market activities are pervasive. The Government rations most basic
 necessities such as food, medicine, clothing, and cooking gas, which are in very short
 Supply-
 The Government requires foreign companies in joint ventures with state entities
 to hire and pay workers through the State. Pax Christi and other NGO's have criti-
 cized these exploitative labor practices, which force foreign companies to pay the
 Government as much as $500 to $600 per month for workers, with the workers in
 turn receiving only a small peso wage from the Government.
 The standard workweek is 44 hours, with shorter workdays in hazardous occupa-
 tions, such as mining. The Government also reduced the workday in some govern-
 ment offices and state enterrises to save energy.
 Workplace environmental and safety controls are usually inadequate, and the
 Government lacks effective enforcement mechanisms. Industrial accidents appar-
 ently are frequent, but the Government suppresses such reports. The Labor Code
 establishes that a worker who considers his life in danger because of hazardous con-
 ditions has the right not to work in his position or not to engage in specific activities
 until such risks are eliminated. According to the Labor Code, the worker remains
 obligated to work temporarily in whatever other position may be assigned him at
 a salry prescribed by law.
