 BOLIVIA
 Bolivia is now a democracy with a constitutionally elected
 Government. On July 14, 1985 the country held free democratic
 elections which resulted in the first constitutional
 transition from one civilian government to another in almost
 20 years. On August 6, after a close contest between the
 Nationalist Democratic Action (ADN) party candidate Hugo
 Banzer and the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR)
 candidate Victor Paz Estenssoro, the latter was elected
 President by the Bolivian Congress in accordance with
 constitutional processes. The new Government's authority was
 tested almost immediately when its economic program was
 challenged by organized labor in a series of general strikes.
 The Government responded by declaring a state of siege which
 curtailed the rights to protest and assembly, in accordance
 with constitutional provisions, and by cracking down sharply
 on trade unionists, moves approved by the Congress and broadly
 accepted by the public.
 The state security apparatus, which had been used by military
 governments in the past to torture and intimidate, was
 abolished under the 1982-85 government of Siles Zuazo, but
 Bolivia still has an internal intelligence service which falls
 under the responsibility of the Ministry of Interior, as well
 as intelligence services associated with the military. The
 internal intelligence service was active in rounding up and
 detaining Bolivian trade unionists in September 1985 under the
 Government's state of siege measures.
 Bolivia is the poorest country in South America despite the
 rich natural resources available to a sparse population. The
 export sector, dominated by state enterprises, has stagnated
 for years and there has been a continual decline in the
 standard of living. As one of its first moves, the new
 Government announced a set of stringent economic adjustment
 measures designed to halt hyperinflation (the world's highest
 at 20,000 percent annually), reduce a huge fiscal deficit of
 nearly 30 percent of gross domestic product and restore
 economic growth which had contracted by approximately 20
 percent in real terms from 1982 to 1984. The new economic
 plan emphasizes free market solutions to the economic crisis.
 For example, by breaking up government monopolies in sugar,
 rice, and wheat production, incentives have been created for
 individual farmers to produce as much of these products as
 they can sell at prevailing market prices.
 In 1985, Bolivia witnessed a continuation of the improvement
 in the human rights situation which commenced with the end of
 the military government in 1982, although the record was not
 fully satisfactory. The temporary detention of some 3,000
 trade union members on September 19 under provisions of the
 state of siege curtailed the freedoms of assembly, travel, and
 peaceful protest, albeit under terms of the Constitution and
 without any reports of torture, deaths, injuries, or
 disappearances such as had occurred under previous
 governments. On October 14, 1985 the Bolivian Military Court
 reduced the sentences of the so-called Luribay Seven detained
 in October 1983, but did not as requested grant a public trial
 in a civilian court. The October 1984 amnesty declared in
 their behalf by President Siles Zuazo was never honored by the
 military courts.

 BOLIVIA
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings in Bolivia in 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no verified cases of politically motivated
 disappearance in Bolivia in 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits all forms of torture, and neither
 the Siles Zuazo Government nor the Paz Estenssoro Government
 has practiced or condoned the use of torture. Most problems
 of prisoner mistreatment arise from overcrowded prison
 conditions and from underpaid, undertrained prison and police
 personnel. Corruption, malnutrition, and unsanitary
 conditions are endemic in Bolivia's underfinanced prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Constitution, no one can be arrested without a court
 order and detainees must be charged or released within 24
 hours. However, Article 111 of the Constitution provides that
 the executive branch of government can declare a state of
 siege "in case of grave danger caused by internal commotion or
 international war," and under Article 112 detainees can be
 held 48 hours.
 A state of siege was declared on September 19, 1985, and the
 Government explained its action on the basis of labor's
 decision to radicalize and broaden its general strike which
 was crippling vital sectors of the economy and was widely
 regarded to be primarily political in motivation. On October
 2, the Bolivian Congress approved the Government's state of
 siege by a 94 to 39 vote. The state of siege was lifted on
 December 18, 1985.
 As many as 3,000 trade unionists and bystanders were detained
 by Bolivian armed forces and police. Some detainees
 complained that the decision to keep or release them was made
 by men wearing hoods. Most detainees were never charged, and
 within 24 hours the Government had released all but some 200
 unionists who were given a choice of internal or external
 exile, in accordance with the constitutional provisions on a
 state of siege. Four trade unionists went to Peru while the
 others remained in Bolivia where they were internally exiled
 to rural military bases in isolated parts of Bolivia.
 Conditions on the bases were primitive and many detainees
 complained about poor food, isolation from their families, and
 hot weather. There were no reports of torture.
 The Government began releasing detainees on October 1, and the
 following day the Government and the unions approved an
 agreement ending the strike. By October 9, 1985, all the
 detainees were released except Fausto Ardaya Bernal from
 theNational Telecommunications Company (ENTEL) union; he was
 no longer being held under state of siege rules but rather was
 being held without bail for criminal acts. In response to a
 writ of habeas corpus, the Government on October 10 brought
 
 
 433
 BOLIVIA
 Ardaya before the court. Other trade unionists who were also
 charged with criminal offenses, notably former officers of the
 Central Bank, were released on bail.
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by Bolivian labor law.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Government has upheld the right of fair public trial, but
 delays in the judicial system are common.
 Seven persons detained by the army near Luribay in 1983 for
 alleged involvement in training of leftist groups were
 convicted of arms theft and attempted treason by a military
 court in 1984 after the Bolivian Supreme Court ruled that the
 military court had jurisdiction to try the case. On October
 28, 1984, President Siles granted amnesty to the seven
 detainees, but the dispute over legal jurisdiction prevented
 their release. On October 14, 1985, the Supreme Military
 Tribunal published a decree which reduced the sentences of the
 seven detainees and will make possible the parole of four of
 them in April 1986 and the other three in October 1986.
 Bolivia's legal practices allow for two judicial systems:
 civilian and military. The civilian system has control over
 Bolivian civil and penal codes. According to article 127 of
 the Constitution, the Supreme Court, Bolivia's highest
 civilian judical body, also may review legislative measures
 and judge whether or not their statutes are in accordance with
 a citizen's "concrete rights or with the Constitution."
 Article 208 of the Constitution gives the military the
 "fundamental mission to defend and conserve national
 independence, the republic's security and stability, honor and
 national sovereignty." To perform this "mission," the
 Bolivian military established in 1976 a revised military penal
 code and a law on the organization of the military judiciary.
 These measures define and establish military jurisdiction over
 actions against the security of the state, military personnel,
 or property.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home and the privacy of citizens' lives
 are protected by the Constitution and normally are respected
 in practice. House searches, monitoring of conversations, and
 other abuses that occurred under military regimes in the past
 ceased during the Siles Zuazo Government.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 As a democratic country, Bolivia enjoyed an independent,
 unfettered, and critical press throughout most of 1985.
 Exceptions occurred with the September 19 imposition of a
 state of siege when Interior Ministry agents entered
 worker-owned and -managed pro-labor radio stations and shut
 them down. However, by the end of 1985, all radio stations in
 Bolivia had reopened including the worker-run "Radio
 Continental" in La Paz. Two journalists for the Bolivian
 Workers Central (COB) were internally exiled along with other
 detainees for about 2 weeks under the state of siege. The
 
 
 434
 BOLIVIA
 most widely publicized government violation of press freedom-
 was the September 23 detention of Antonio Peredo, editor of
 leftist weekly AQUI. Interior Ministry plainclothesmen
 initially had tried to apprehend Peredo in the Congress, but
 several Congressmen had intervened. Arrested later a few
 blocks away, he was released without charge after spending the
 night in the Interior Ministry; he said he had not been
 mistreated. Interior Minister Fernando Barthelemy
 subsequently apologized publicly for the incident.
 Since the restoration of democracy in 1982, Bolivians have had
 a generally unrestricted press which represents a wide
 spectrum of ideological points of view. Both the Siles Zuazo
 and the Paz Estenssoro Governments have tolerated criticism
 from the media, including during the state of siege. Academic
 freedom is enjoyed at Bolivia's schools. There are both
 state-owned and privately owned radio and television stations,
 and the newspapers are all privately owned.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Except during the state of siege, peaceful assembly and
 association have not been restricted. Under the original
 provisions of the state of siege, groups of three or more were
 not allowed to gather between midnight (later changed to 3
 a.m.) and 6 a.m., demonstrations and protest marches were
 prohibited, and permission had to be obtained from the police
 to hold a gathering or a party in the evening. Such police
 permits were readily available for a modest fee.
 Bolivians have the right of association and the right to
 organize and bargain collectively. While Bolivian law still
 does not extend these rights to government jobs, in practice
 this distinction has been ignored and virtually all government
 employees are unionized.
 The Bolivians Workers Central, an umbrella labor federation
 which represents the majority of Bolivian workers, is
 independent, politically powerful, and in the past has
 frequently paralyzed the economy with crippling strikes.
 Since the October 1982 return of democracy to Bolivia, the
 rights of unions have been observed to the extent that many
 persons (especially in the private sector) feel that the
 unions are too well protected. Under the Paz Estenssoro
 Government, union/government relations have been strained and
 conflictive. The unions, for example, made a claim to having
 the right of co-government, a claim which went far beyond such
 traditional labor rights as collective bargaining. Matters
 came to a head when the unions sought to veto the executive
 branch's economic policy, a move which precipitated the state
 of siege. Some union leaders have even demanded the same
 political immunity for union leaders as is accorded members of
 Congress.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Citizens are free to practice the religion of their choice,
 and there are no restrictions on churches publishing,
 establishing places of worship and religious schools, training
 clergy, or maintaining international ties. Bolivian law
 requires that religious groups be incorporated, but there is
 no state control or censorship. Since the return to civilian
 government, no clergy have been persecuted for their political
 or religious beliefs or activities.
 
 
 435
 BOLIVIA
 Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion and is
 recognized by the Constitution as the official religion of the
 country. Catholic bishops receive a nominal stipend from the
 State, but no other secular advantage is conferred.
 Protestant churches operate openly and freely. In 1982, a
 Protestant college opened in Santa Cruz. Two years later, a
 Baha'i University opened in the same city. The Mormons and
 Seventh Day Adventists are free to proselytize and to operate
 churches and training centers throughout the country. The
 small Jewish community is not disturbed as it was under
 military regimes, which tolerated neo-Nazi "paramilitary"
 groups which published anti-Semitic tracts. The Mennonites
 have large rural colonies in Santa Cruz.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There were no unusual restrictions on travel within Bolivia or
 abroad except during the temporary state of siege which began
 on September 19, 1985, and ended at midnight December 18,
 1985. Under the provisions of the state of siege, one needed
 a no-fee police permit--which was readily available--to leave
 the country, to travel within Bolivia, and to drive a car
 between midnight and 6 a.m. On October 14, 1985, the
 Government reduced the restricted hours to the period from 3
 a.m. to 6 a.m.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of
 Citizens to Change Their Government
 On July 14, 1985, Bolivia held free democratic elections which
 resulted in the first constitutional transition of power from
 one civilian government to an opposing political party in
 almost 20 years. On August 6, 1985, after a close race at the
 polls between Nationalist Democratic Action (ADN) party
 candidate Hugo Banzer and Nationalist Revolutionary Movement
 (MNR) candidate Victor Paz Estenssoro, the latter was elected
 President by the Bolivian Congress in accordance with
 constitutional processes. No party won a majority and ADN
 candidate Banzer actually received more popular votes (with
 about 28 percent of the total) than the winner Paz Estenssoro
 (who received 27 percent). Because no party won a majority,
 the Congress had to choose the President. The MNR was able to
 gather support from other parties in Congress and on August 6,
 1985, Victor Paz Estenssoro was sworn in as President,
 replacing Siles Zuazo who had governed since October 10, 1982.
 The political system is dominated by persons of European or
 Mestizo origin. Those following a traditional Indian
 lifestyle and speaking Aymara or Quechua as a primary language
 make up an estimated 60 percent of the population and have
 failed to advance to top positions because of economic
 disadvantages and educational and cultural isolation as well
 as an element of overt discrimination, There have been
 notable exceptions to this rule, such as the present Minister
 of Agriculture, Mauricio Mamani Pocoaca, who is a full blooded
 Aymara.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 Violations of Human Rights
 The Government has been sensitive to the opinions of both
 international and domestic organizations regarding alleged
 
 
 436
 BOLIVIA
 violations of civil liberties. An International Confederation
 of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) team visited Bolivia from October
 19 to October 22, 1985, and met with trade union and
 government officials to discuss and observe the local
 situation. The ICFTU officials indicated that a report would
 be forthcoming. Two representatives from the World
 Confederation of Labor (WCL) and its Latin American Workers
 Central (CLAT), visited Bolivia November 1985, to investigate
 what they alleged to be "serious violations of union rights
 and labor laws." They met with Bolivian Workers Central
 leaders and officials of the Ministry of Labor. The visitors
 criticized President Paz and called on him to free several
 imprisoned labor leaders who were being detained on criminal
 charges (unlike the thousands who had been temporarily picked
 up and later released when the Government imposed a state of
 siege on September 19, 1985). In accordance with Bolivian
 legal procedure, one of the leaders held on criminal charges
 was subsequently released pending trial. Among
 nongovernmental organizations, the Catholic church, the
 Permanent Assembly of Human Rights, and the press have been
 the most aggressive monitors of human rights in Bolivia. The
 Bolivian Episcopal Conference of the Catholic Church and some
 Protestant ministers played a role in the past in visiting
 detainees and speaking out against abuses. Individual
 Catholic bishops, many priests, and such lay groups as the
 Bacherer Foundation and the Confederation of Lay Persons have
 been active in the investigation of social problems, and,
 occasionally, human rights issues.
 Amnesty International Report 1985, which covered events in
 1984, expressed concern about lack of progress in
 investigations into disappearances and extra judicial
 executions which took place under previous governments, and
 the failure of some sectors of the military to cooperate in
 those investigations. Freedom House rated Bolivia as "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Bolivia's population in 1985 is estimated at 6.2 million with
 a growth rate of 2.6 percent. World Bank statistics for 1984
 indicate a per capita gross national product of $410.
 The failure of the Siles Zuazo administration to adopt
 adequate economic corrective measures and its repeated
 concessions to labor's demands for wage increases were key
 factors ensuring continued economic deterioration and
 hyperinflation, which exceeded 20,000 percent through
 September 1985. Bolivia has a $3.8 billion international debt
 with debt service payments exceeding the value of legal
 exports. Payments on its debt to foreign commercial banks
 were suspended in April 1984. The newly elected Paz
 Estenssoro Government's economic program of August 29
 represents a head-on attempt to stop the hyperinflationary
 spiral and to reactivate the economy's productive apparatus.
 Implementing a series of free market economic measures such as
 exchange rate, price, and interest rate deregulation, coupled
 with a restrictive public sector wage and monetary policy,
 Bolivia has taken a major step towards economic
 stabilization. This form of shock treatment, although it is
 expected to produce economic improvements in the medium to
 long term, will cause painful adjustments in the short run.
 The Government has opened discussions with its private foreign
 creditors on debt rescheduling, and has begun negotiations
 
 
 437
 BOLIVIA
 with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a standby
 agreement. A concerted effort is being made to improve
 Bolivia's foreign investment climate.
 Life expectancy at birth is estimated at 51.9 years. The
 infant mortality rate is a high 119 per 1,000 live births.
 Data from the 1976 census indicate that 291 out of 1,000 rural
 children die before their 5th year, compared to 186 per 1,000
 urban children. Only 57 percent of the population had access
 to safe water in 1980 (the last year for which this statistic
 is available), and the caloric supply available for
 consumption relative to nutritional requirements was only 90
 percent in 1982.
 World Bank figures show the adult literacy rate was 63.2
 percent in 1976, but more recent Bolivian estimates place it
 at about 73 percent. Public education is free and generally
 available in urban areas, but the school year has frequently
 been interrupted by strikes and protests. According to World
 Bank figures, the primary school enrollment ratio was 86
 percent in 1982. Except in the most isolated areas, Bolivian
 rural youth can expect at least 3 years of schooling.
 Bolivian labor law prohibits any labor contract which denies a
 worker his or her constitutional rights and freedoms. The
 employment of minors under 18 years of age and women in
 dangerous, unhealthy, or immoral work is prohibited. Bolivia
 has acceptable conditions of employment with minimum wage laws
 and an elaborate system of bonuses and compensations. For
 most jobs, especially in the public and mining sectors, most
 workers have an 8-hour day.
 There are laws governing occupational safety and health, but
 often they are not rigorously observed in practice.
 Enforcement is a major problem. The most dangerous and
 unhealthy jobs historically have been in the mines. Many are
 old and operated with antiquated equipment. Mine workers
 suffer from silicosis, but many do not wear their safety masks.
 Although protected in theory by social legislation that
 represented a pioneering effort in the Latin American context,
 Bolivian women do not enjoy a status in society equal to that
 of men. The main obstacles to advancement are cultural
 traditions, social conditions, and a lack of political
 influence. In rural families, women have contributed
 significantly to economic activities but are nonetheless
 considered subordinate. In some urban families, women are
 slowly achieving a greater role in Bolivian business life and
 increasingly are beginning to participate in cooperatives,
 community meetings, and education.
 Since 1952 racial discrimination has been banned in Bolivia.
 However, informal discrimination persists against persons of
 Indian background by those persons wholly or partly of
 European ancestry. At least partially as a result of this
 discriminatory treatment, the Indian population is at the
 lower end of the country's socioeconomic scale, with the
 expected adverse effects on health, life expectancy,
 education, income, and unemployment.
