 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 General Andre Dieudonne Kolingba has headed the Government
 since his accession to power in a bloodless coup on September
 1, 1981. He holds all political power and is the final
 arbiter on all government matters. He also headed the
 Military Committee for National Recovery until September 21,
 1985, when that Committee was dissolved to make way for the
 current civilian Government. On May 7, 1986. the President
 announced his plans for the creation of a single national
 political party, the Central African Democratic Assembly. On
 October 31, Kolingba introduced a new Constitution which was
 subsequently approved in a national referendum on November 21,
 1986. He was also elected President in that vote. The new
 Constitution provides for a parliament which includes a
 National Assembly and an Economic and Regional Council,
 representing the principal economic and regional sectors of
 the country.
 The Minister of Interior is in charge of the civilian police
 force. These police normally man barriers on the major roads
 and keep records of the movement of vehicles. The Presidency
 has its own security force. The Ministry of Defense also has
 a military police force, in addition to the armed forces.
 The Central African Republic is a poor, landlocked, sparsely
 populated country. Most of its inhabitants derive their
 livelihood from subsistence agriculture. Only about 1 percent
 of the population is university educated. The essentially
 free enterprise, agrarian economy, one of the world's least
 monetized, has suffered from inadequately coordinated and
 implemented government policies, occasional drought, and a
 poorly trained work force, Expatriates dominate the small
 manufacturing and commercial sectors of the economy.
 There was continued improvement in the human rights situation
 in 1986. Kolingba's Government again faced sporadic
 challenges from dissidents in the north along the Chadian
 border, but at a greatly reduced level. Following the release
 in December 1985 of 89 political prisoners, Kolingba granted
 additional pardons on June 30 and September 1, 1986 (the fifth
 anniversary of Kolingba's accession to power). Although most
 of those pardoned were common criminals, the pardons of
 September I included the release of 5 prisoners convicted by
 the special tribunal (the court which tries political cases)
 and the reduction in sentence from 10 years to 5 years for 13
 others convicted by the special tribunal. The sudden return
 from exile and arrest of former emperor Jean-Bedel Bokassa in
 October posed an unexpected challenge to the Government in
 that a new trial means reliving a difficult period in the
 country's recent history.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of killing or summary executions for
 .political motives by government forces. While there may have
 been some civilian casualties during the military action
 against guerrillas in April 1985, none was reported in 1986.

 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance as a result of
 government action.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The penal code prohibits torture and provides for sanctions
 against persons guilty of physical abuse. Nevertheless, there
 are reports of beatings in prisons. Conditions in the prisons
 are generally harsh, and medical attention is inadequate.
 However, prominent political detainees have reportedly been
 well treated and given special privileges, such as extra
 family visits.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Kolingba Government has occasionally engaged in arbitrary
 arrest and imprisonment. Generally such arrests occur when a
 suspect has allegedly engaged in acts which present a threat
 to the regime. It is likely that some political detainees are
 currently being held, but it is difficult to say precisely how
 many are being held at any one time. There was no confirmation
 of Amnesty International's statement, as expressed in its 1986
 Report, that more than 100 alleged opponents of the Government
 may have been detained without trial in 1985.
 Security officials generally respect local law which allows
 family members, legal counsel, doctors, and clergy access to
 prisoners. It is not uncommon for those held outside the main
 prison to be allowed to return home during the day or to sleep
 at night. Under local law, political detainees can be held
 without charge for as long as 2 months, but at that point
 detainees must either be formally charged or released. If
 they are charged, local judicial'procedures (which are modeled
 on French procedures) allow for open-ended preventive
 detention while the public prosecutor prepares the State's
 case against the accused. Some political detainees are held
 much longer than 2 months, however, without formal charges
 being brought against them. In the case of common criminals,
 the law requires that they be brought within 96 hours before a
 magistrate who decides whether formal charges will be filed.
 Approximately six well-known political opponents live in
 exile. Several of them have been sentenced to death in
 absentia for crimes against the State. However, during the
 December 1, 1985, National Day celebration President Kolingba
 indicated a possible willingness to move toward reconciliation
 with opposition elements. On October 23, 1986, former Emperor
 Jean-Bedel Bokassa unexpectedly returned'to the Central African
 Republic from his exile in France. Bokassa, who was sentenced
 to death in absentia in 1980 for crimes including murder,
 cannibalism, and embezzlement, was immediately detained and is
 being retried in local criminal court.
 The Government has been cited by the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) for being in violation of ILO Conventions
 29 and 105 for allegedly imposing compulsory labor on
 prisoners jailed for unauthorized political activities.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In most cases involving common criminals, the Government
 permits French-modeled legal procedures to be fairly and
 
 
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 openly applied and the laws to be properly executed. The new
 Constitution continues the provisions of the constitutional
 decree of September 21, 1985 which states that the judiciary
 "is guaranteed independence (from) the legislative and
 executive (power)." The President of the Republic is the
 guarantor of that independence in his role as "President of
 the Supreme Magistrative Council."
 A special tribunal comprising civilian magistrates and
 military advisers adjudicates political cases. The special
 tribunal differs from ordinary courts in that there is no
 appeal process except for the possibility of presidential
 clemency, and trials must be specifically authorized by the
 President. Political detainees have a right to legal counsel
 from the start of formal procedures. President Kolingba has
 authorized the meeting of the special tribunal on a fairly
 frequent basis. Trials are open to the public, and the
 proceedings are often reported in the local media.
 The number of political prisoners is unknown. The case of
 High Commissioner Francois Gueret, secretary general of the
 banned political party, Movement for Democracy and
 Independence, has been well publicized and is not atypical.
 In February 1985, he was arrested and charged with destroying
 administrative documents and inciting public disorder. When
 the state prosecutor found insufficient evidence to support
 those charges, Gueret was charged with refusing to wear the
 military uniform required of High Commissioners. A judicial
 inquiry recommended his release at the end of April.
 Nevertheless, he continued to be detained and was finally
 charged with trying to overthrow the Government. A public
 trial, under a special tribunal, was held, and he was
 convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison. His sentence
 was reduced to 5 years by presidential clemency on September
 1, 1986. On December 1, 1986, Gueret was released as a result
 of Presidential clemency. Another prominent political
 prisoner, Major Gregoire Miango, first arrested in October
 1983, was released on April 14, 1986. However, he is not
 allowed to travel outside his home town where he currently
 resides with his family.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Except for political and security matters, the Government does
 not generally interfere in the private life of citizens.
 There is no forced membership in any political organization,
 and there is no interference with the right to marry or have
 children as one chooses. Parents are free to teach their
 children religious beliefs and practices, with the exception
 of the Jehovah's Witnesses (Section 2.c.). The criminal code
 prohibits the invasion of the home without a warrant, and this
 prohibition is not generally abused in civil and minor
 criminal cases. However, if a political crime is involved,
 ordinance 81/035, which instituted the special tribunal,
 authorizes searches at any time and at any place. These
 searches have been conducted without specific warrants.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The right to speak publicly about political developments or to
 criticize the Government is circumscribed although most people
 feel free to comment privately on political affairs. The
 
 
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 Government prohibits the distribution of tracts and literature
 deemed to be subversive. Since July 1, 1986 there has been
 only one regularly published newspaper, which, along with
 others that appear sporadically, is carefully monitored by the
 Government. Radio and television are also controlled by the
 Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Only assemblies of a nonpolitical nature can take place
 without government approval. Unlawful assemblies are
 disbanded by government forces, and in some instances some of
 those participating in the assemblies have been arrested.
 In 1981, Kolingba suspended the General Union of Central
 African Workers, and no effective labor movement has existed
 in the country since that time. The Government tacitly
 approves of an apolitical labor federation that exists mostly
 on paper and has no collective bargaining authority. The ILO
 has a case pending before it involving the Central African
 Republic's alleged violations of the right to freedom of
 association under ILO Convention 87. The Government has yet
 to provide the substantive information requested by the ILO
 Committee reviewing the case. The right to strike exists in
 principle, although fear of government reprisals has dampened
 the enthusiasm of potential strikers.
 In response to a month-long student strike in March-April
 1986, the Government has banned boycotts of classes and all
 demonstrations by school children and university students,
 except for those authorized by the Ministry of the Interior.
 Those violating this prohibition face up to a 3-year prison
 term.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government does not generally interfere with religious
 activities. Religious organizations and missionary groups are
 provided religious freedom by Central African custom. No
 single religion predominates, nor does the Government appear
 to discriminate in favor of or against specific religions.
 In 1986 there was a major exception to the Government's policy
 of noninterference in religious activities. The Minister of
 the Interior formally prohibited the activities of the
 Jehovah's Witnesses on February 1, 1986. This decree was
 aimed primarily against the foreign missionary Jehovah's
 Witnesses who had refused to participate in
 government-sponsored activities or to encourage allegiance to
 the Government. As a result of this government action, all
 foreign missionary Jehovah's Witnesses have left the country,
 and native-born adherents to the sect are prohibited from
 openly practicing their faith.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 People are generally free to move about within the country,
 although there are road checkpoints. The right of voluntary
 travel and repatriation is recognized. Financial and
 educational constraints rather than government controls act to
 restrict most foreign travel and emigration. No case of
 revocation of citizenship was reported in 1986.
 
 
 59
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 The country remains relatively hospitable to foreigners; the
 largest foreign population living either temporarily or
 permanently in the country is from Chad, with the vast
 majority relying on U.N. relief for support. At the beginning
 of 1986 there were some 20,000 Chadian refugees living in four
 refugee camps sponsored by the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees and another approximately 20,000
 living in Bangui and along the northern border area. Due to
 the increase in political stability in Chad during 1986, many
 of these refugees have been voluntarily repatriated. As of
 late 1986, the total Chadian refugee population in Central
 African Republic was approximately 14,500.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 On September 21, 1985, President Kolingba dissolved the
 National Committee for Recovery and appointed a civilian
 Cabinet, an event which continued the process begun in 1984 of
 moving from a military government towards institutionalization
 of a civilian government, presently composed of 18 Ministers,
 4 Secretaries of State, and 3 High Commissioners. In the
 referendum on the new Constitution, Central Africans endorsed
 Kolingba as President, in his capacity of head of a newly
 created single political party, the Central African Democratic
 Assembly. Currently, President Kolingba retains all political
 power, presiding over the executive branch and establishing
 legislation through the Council of Ministers and by
 presidential decree. Although in practice he allows his
 Cabinet considerable leeway in the day-to-day activities of
 government administration, he makes all important policy
 decisions. Since September 1, 1981, all forms of public and
 private assembly for political purposes have been proscribed,
 and Kolingba has stated that he has "no intention of returning
 his country to the turbulent multiparty experience of the
 pre-1981 regime."
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government does not welcome and is sensitive to
 international or nongovernmental investigation of alleged
 human rights abuses but does not prohibit such
 investigations. Representatives of Amnesty International and
 the International Committee of the Red Cross visit Bangui
 periodically.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There are more than 80 ethnic groups in the Central African
 Republic, each with its own language. About 70 percent are
 Baya-Mandjia and Banda. Preference for high government
 positions has generally been given to members of President
 Kolingba's Yakoma ethnic group (approximately 10 percent of
 the population). However, the preeminence of this group has
 declined in the past year.
 The Constitution mandates that all persons are equal before
 the law without regard to race, ethnic origin, region, sex, or
 religion. However, women have traditionally been accorded a
 lower status than men. For example, there is less emphasis on
 the importance of education for women, and this is reflected
 in the fact that only 19 percent of the adult female population
 
 
 60
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 is literate as opposed to 49 percent of the male population.
 The requirements of their work at home and in the fields
 prevent many women from receiving any formal education.
 Although polygamy is common, the legal system and traditional
 practice support the rights of the wives and all children of
 such marriages. A national women's organization exists and is
 supported by the Government. There are no women ministers,
 secretaries of state, or high commissioners in the Kolingba
 Government.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Employment of children under 14 years of age is forbidden by
 law. While it is only loosely enforced, jobs are in such
 demand that children in the labor force are generally limited
 to working as helpers in family business, such as selling food
 products or cigarettes. Minimum wages have been established
 by the Government, and a social security system exists.
 However, much labor is performed outside the wage and social
 security system and probably does not meet the established
 minimum levels. The law sets maximum working hours for
 government employees and most people in the private sector at
 40 hours per week. Domestic employees may work up to 55
 hours. There are also general laws of health and safety
 standards in the work place but they are neither precisely
 defined nor actively enforced.
