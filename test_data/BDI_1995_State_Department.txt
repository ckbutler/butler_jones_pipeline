 BURUNDI
 Burundi's first democratically elected government retained power despite the as-
 sassination of President Melchior Ndadaye, an ethnic Hutu, in an October 1993
 coup attempt, and the death of his successor, Cyprien Ntaryamira, a Hutu, in a sus-
 picious April 1994 plane crash. The Government consists of executive, legislative,
 and judicial branches, which operate under the 1992 Constitution and the Septem-
 ber 1994 Convention of Government. The Constitution provides for an independent
 judiciary, but in practice it is dominated by the Tutsi ethnic group.
 The Convention of Government created a 10-member National Security Council,
 led by the President and Prime Minister, to mediate between the branches of gov-
 
 
 ermnent as needed. Real power, however, lies with the military and the minority
 opposition headed by the Tutsi-dominated UPRONA Party, which obtained a num-
 ber of power sharing concessions from the majority, Hutu-dominated FRODEBU
 party  n presidentiAl succession negotiations following President Ntaramira's
 death. While a multiparty political system remains in place, effective aut ority is
 limited due to both a strong political opposition and a lack of effective control of the
 military.
 Political conflict between the majority Hlutu and opposition Tutsi parties has par-
 alyzed the Government. Several Hutu ministers received anonymous death threats;
 two were murdered. Tensions between Burundi's ethnic Tutsi minority-which his-
 torically maintained political, economic, and military control over the country-and
 the Hutu majority remain high. Violent conflict between Hutu and Tutsi armed
 militants as well as the army has plunged the country into a spiral of ethnic vio-
 lence verging on civil war that has not spared the civilian population.
 Security forces consist of the army and the gendarmerie under the Ministry of De-
 fense, the judicial police under the Ministry of Justice, and the public security and
 documentation police forces under the Ministry of the Interior. The high command
 of the Tutsi-dominated military professes loyalty to the elected government and neu-
 trality in political negotiations. However, the military has committed at least four
 massacres of unarmed civilian Hutus and frequently permitted Tutsi extremists to
 create civil disturbances and engage in violence against Hutus. Hutu rebel forces
 have also massacred both Hutu and Tutsi civilians.
 Burundi is poor and densely populated, with over four-fifths of the population en-
 gaged in subsistence agrculture. The small monetary economy is based largely on
 the export of coffee and tea. The ongoing violence since the October 1993 coup has
 caused severe disruptions and dislocations. Large numbers of internally displaced
 families were unable to produce their own food crops and had to depend largely on
 international humanitarian assistance. The Government made little progress in its
 efforts to privatize parastatal enterprises.
 The human rights situation generally deteriorated as the security forces and
 armed civilian groups committed extensive serious human rights abuses, which the
 Government was largely     unable to   prevent. Perpetrators generally  went
 unpunished. Because of its superior firepower and wide dispersion, the most serious
 abuses involved actions by the armed forces. Serious incidents of ethnically moti-
 vated destruction and extrajudicial killing occurred throughout the country. Armed
 troops brutally killed both armed.and unarmed ethnic rivals, including women, chil-
 dren, and the elderly.
 Government efforts to restore security were inadequate. Members of the armed
 forces and vigilante groups committed serious human rights violations with impu-
 nity. The lack of accountability for those responsible for the coup attempt, assas-
 sinations, and ethnic violence was universally recognized as a primary cause of pub-
 lic insecurity. The dysfunctional justice system could not satisfactorily address this
 problem due to its own inefficiency, administrative disruption, and the public's per-
 ception of its partiality to Tutsi officials.
 There continued to be disappearances and credible reports of the torture of pris-
 oners. Prison conditions remain life threatening. Legal and societal discrimination
 against women continues to be a serious problem; violence against women also oc-
 curs. The Twa (Pygmy) minority remained almost completely marginalized.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Amnesty International estimates
 that between October 1993 and December 1995 over 100,000 people were killed in
 ethnic violence. The Army was more responsible than any other group for these
 deaths, and also frequently committed abuses in Government-approved operations
 to disarm civilians. In addition to extrajudicial killings by the armed forces armed
 militias and other combatant groups perpetrated unlawful, politically and ethnically
 motivated killings of political opponents and members of the other ethnic groups.
 In June the military, in pursuit of armed Hutu militants, entered Bujumbura's
 Kamenge neighborhood andkilled an estimated 150 civilians, including women, chil-
 dren, and the elderly, according to a high-ranking Hutu government official. Many
 were shot at close range. In July a soldier shot and killed a driver employed by the
 National Democratic Institute (NI). No one has been prosecuted for the killings in
 Kamenge; an investigation into the death of the NDI driver was underway at year's
 end.
 An army operation August 28 at Choga Hill near Bujumbura resulted in the kill-
 ing of an estimated 30 to 50 civilians. Choga townspeople brought four brutally slain
 
 
 civilians to the Unity Monument; two were women, two were children. The two
 women had been shot in the chest. One of the dead children was a boy of 5 whose
 head had been split open. The second child was a boy about 10 years old who had
 been bayoneted in the stomach.
 A Western observer reported that he had seen soldiers shoot a mother, father, and
 child at point blank range near Bujumbura on September 9.
 Men dressed in army uniforms reportedly killed a Hutu Catholic priest in
 Marenga, 90 kilometers northeast of Bujumbura. The assailants dragged the priest
 from church during mass. Later, they bayonetted and discarded his body. According
 to a local human rights group, witnesses report that in June a Hutu priest was ab-
 ducted by a group of young men in downtown Bujumbura. His body was found two
 days later in the Tutsi neighborhood of Bwiza in Bujumbura.
 In August and September alone, eight Burundian Catholic priests were murdered
 throughout the country. On September 30, two Italian priests and a lay missionary
 were murdered at their mission in Buyengero. According to government officials,
 three soldiers accused of the priests' murder "escaped" from the custody of the au-
 thorities in October and have not been recaptured. A fourth person reportedly re-
 mains in custody.
 In November elements of the military killed 421 unarmed villagers at Gasarara;
 most were children. Tutsi civilian authorities reportedly accompanied the soldiers
 responsible for the massacre to a church were many villagers were hiding. The Gov-
 ernment ordered a ministerial investigation.
 In Bujumbura Hutu and Tutsi paramilitary and vigilante youth groups shot,
 stoned, beat, and stabbed to death people of differing ethnicity. In the countryside,
 armed Hutu gangs ambushed army units, who in turn carried out vengeance attacks
 with armed Tutsi gangs against Hutu civilians. In many areas of the country, both
 Hutu and Tutsi civilians continued to be killed in sporadic violence perpetrated by
 government security forces and armed gangs.
 In March armed Hutu militants murdered three Belgian civilians, including a 3-
 year-old, in a highway ambush south of Bujumbura. In May a Greek employee of
 Catholic Relief Services was murdered in Kirundo province. In April an armed at-
 tack by Hutu rebels against a military post in the city of Gasorwe resulted in the
 deaths of two soldiers and five attackers. Authorities failed to identify perpetrators
 in these incidents.
 In two separate incidents during May, armed insurgents ambushed soldiers in the
 provinces of rural Bujumbura and Cibitoke, killing five and seriously wounding one.
 The perpetrators escaped in both incidents. In June unidentified attackers am-
 bushed a motorcade carrying the Minister of External Relations and the U.S. am-
 bassador. The attack, for which no group claimed responsibility, resulted in the
 deaths of one army officer and an Organization for African Unity (OAU) captain
 from Burkina Faso. In addition, eight other members of the motorcade were wound-
 ed, including three OAU personnel, four soldiers, and one security guard.
 In June at least 17 Hutu university students were killed in revenge attacks for
 the killing of 2 Tutsi high school students earlier that day. In August a group of
 Hutu militants attacked and brutally killed a Tutsi officer and his pregnant wife,
 whom they eviscerated. In September unidentified attackers ambushed a vehicle
 convoy carrying the Archbishop of Gitega, a Tutsi, north of Bujumbura. Three peo-
 ple were killed and several people were wounded. No one was arrested and charged
 in any of these crimes.
 In 2 incidents during May and June, unidentified civilians threw grenades into
 Bujumbura's central market, killing a total of 8 and injuring more than 30 people.
 Police forces have made no arrests in those incidents. It was not clear whether the
 attacks were criminally, personally, or politically motivated. Increasingly in
 Bujumbura, all three elements, in varying degrees, motivated incidents of violence.
 Armed ethnic groups carried out assassinations throughout the year. In January
 a lone attacker stabbed to. death the Hutu governor of Muyinga province. The
 attacker was not apprehended, and the exact motive of the attack remained uncer-
 tain. However, earler on the day he was killed, the governor had publicly con-
 demned armed Hutu insurgents operating in the province.
 In March gunmen shot and killed the (Hutu) Minister of Energy and Mines in
 downtown Bujumbura. The Government established a commission of inquiry into
 the murder and took two suspects into custody. In March a group of Hutu militants
 abducted and brutally murdered a retired Tutsi army lieutenant colonel in northern
 Bujumbura. Many viewed the attack as vengeance against the Tutsis for the murder
 of the Minister of Energy and Mines. Eight suspects have been arrested. No trial
 for these killings had taken place by year's end.
 In May the Hutu chief of cabinet for the Ministry of Health was abducted and
 murdered in Bujumbura. His body, recovered in a river, bore indications of torture.
 
 
 25
 Conflicting reports blame both Hutu militants and government security forces. A
 suspect has been arrested, but no trial has taken place.
 Also in May unknown assailants assassinated a local Hutu administrator in
 Cibitoke province. The administrator was reportedly outspoken against the military.
 In June a Hutu professor and director of research for the University of Burundi was
 assassinated in his office by an unknown gunman. Following his death all Hutu pro-
 fessors fled the campus. Some have since returned.
 In July unknown assailants abducted and murdered the Hutu counsellor for diplo-
 matic and political affairs at the National Assembly. The National Assembly presi-
 dent accused the military of the murder. The military accused Hutu militants of try-
 ingto discredit them. No arrest was made in the case.
 The military and Ministry of Justice report that the military issued approximately
 3,500 sanctions against its personnel for excesses carried out against civilians be-
 tween October 1993 and July 1995. Of the 3,500 sanctions, 238 resulted in prison
 sentences, of which 2 are life sentences.
 National efforts to investigate those responsible for the October 1993 coup at-
 tempt and subsequent violence have made little progress. The Ministry of Justice
 reports that a national commission of inquiry created in 1994 has resulted in the
 arrests of 100 people (including military personnel) believed to be associated with
 the coup attempt. Although the commission has not been dissolved, it no longer
 functions.
 Many of those arrested in connection with the 1993 coup attempt and subsequent
 ethnic violence were not tried, although they remained in custody as a result of po-
 litical gridlock in the National Assembly which prevented the appointment of court
 personnel and the reconstitution of the criminal courts. In September, however, the
 President bypassed the Assembly and, through presidential decree, made new judi-
 cial appointments which allowed the reconstitution of the criminal courts. By year's
 end criminal courts were functioning at Bujumbura, Gitega, and Ngozi.
 b. Disappearance.-Local hiiman rights groups reported that abduction and dis-
 appearance were commonplace occurrences throughout the year. Disappearances
 were the result of both political and ethnic rivalry. Valid numerical estimates were
 not available, as many disappearances were not reported and some may have been
 civil crimes. Disappearances in the countryside are reported even less frequently.
 A well-informed source reports that on April 15 poie at a miitary chckpoint
 in rural Bujumbura arrested a Hutu man with no known political affiliation. Police
 said that the man was released on April 17, yet the man's family, working through
 a local human rights r              that he disappeared while in police custody.
 A local human rights group said that in Soptember three Hutu men, arrested by
 the police in the Kamang neighborhood of Bujumbu, disappeared while in cus-
 tdy. Police told the human rights group that the men had been released a few days
 after their arrests.
 In March a group of Hutu militants abducted and murdered a retired Tutsi mili-
 tary officer in northern Bujumbura (see Section l.a.). There was no further informa-
 tion on six Tutis who disappeared in 1994.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punihment.-
 The Constitution prohibits these abuses, but they occur in practice. In March Am-
 nesty International delegates interviewed prisoners who bore cear marks of torture.
 State-run prison conditions were life threatening and characterized by severe
 overcrowding and inadequate hygiene, clothing, medical care, food, and water. Four
 or five persons were forced to share a poorly ventlated cell two meters square. Pris-
 oners had to rely on family members to ensure an adequate diet, and officials ac-
 knowledged that digestive iilness was a major problem among the prisoners. Women
 were held separately from men. Human rights monitrs are reportedly permitted to
 visit prisons.
 In April security forces discovered Hutu militants operating a civilian prison in
 the Hutu neighborood of Kamenge where two people were being held. Four pris-
 oners who had been tied up andibeaten were discovered in another Hutu jail in
 Kamenge. In September a well-informed source reported the poresene of a private
 prison run by Tutsi militants in the Bwiza neighborhood of Bujumbura. Scalping
 and mutilation, including the breaking of limbs and cutting off of ears, were report-
 edljy carried out at this prison.
 Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Elie.- residing magistrates are authorized to
 issue arrest warrants. Regular police and gendarmes can make arrests without a
 warrant hut must submit a written report to a magistrate within 48 hours of the
 detention. A magistrate can order the suspect released or confirm the charges and
 continue detention, initially for 15 days, then subsequently for periods of 30 days
 as necessary to prepare th ee se for trial.
 
 
 26
 The law also allows unlimited pretrial detention. The police are obligated to follow
 the same procedures as magistrates, but have detained people for extended periods
 without announcing charges certifying the cases, or forwarding them to the Min-
 istry of Justice as required. hail is permitted in some cases. Incommunicado deten-
 tion reportedly exists, although the law prohibits it.
 The disruption of the political process and the general level of insecurity within
 the country severely impeded the judicial process. Pretrial detainees constituted
 about 75 percent of the prison population of approximately 4,000 inmates.
 The Constitution prohibits political exile, and the Government did not use forced
 exile as a means of political control. However, many people chose voluntary exile
 in Zaire and elsewhere. Many high-level officials keep their families outside Bu-
 rundi. The Minister of External Relations fled the country in June while in August
 the Minister of Transportation, Posts, and Telecommunications aso fled, both out
 of fear for their safety.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independentjudi-
 ciary, but in practice the judiciary is dominated by the Tutsi ethnic group. Hutus
 accounted for 13 of the countrs 228 judges and lawyers. The President's authority
 to appoint judges and to pardon or reduce sentences was limited by constitutional
 amendment in September 1994 during presidential succession negotiations. Most
 citizens assume the courts still promote the interests of the dominant Tutsi minor-
 ity, and members of the Hutu majority perceive that the Tutsi-dominated judicial
 system is biased against them.
 The judicial system was severely disrupted as a result of the October 1993 coup
 attempt, the repeated presidential succession negotiations in 1994, and the ongoing
 violence in 1995. When operating normally, the Judicial system is divided into civil
 and criminal courts with the Supreme Court at the apex.
 Military courts have jurisdiction over crimes committed by members of the mili-
 tary or those involving actions against the military. The Constitution provides for
 a high court to try the President, Prime Minister, or the president of the National
 Assembly; it provides for a Constitutional Court to review all new laws (including
 decree/laws) and constitutional issues.
 Citizens do not have regular access to civilian and military court proceedings, al-
 though trials are ostensibly public. Defendants are presumed innocent and have the
 right to appeal. While defendants have a right to counsel and to defend themselves,
 few have legal representation in practice.
 The criminal court system has not functioned since October 1993. Those arrested
 on criminal charges since October 1993 remained in custody awaiting trial. The civil
 court system functioned, although the lack of a well-trained and adequately sup-
 ported judiciary constrained expeditious proceedings. In September the President
 appointed by decree three judges and five jury members to each of the three crimi-
 nal courts. The criminal court system provides for five-member juries, appointed by
 the President, which sit for 1-year periods. The appointments will permit the sys-
 tem, whose structure remains unchanged, to resume functioning after a lapse of
 more than 2 years. During this time the President and National Assembly failed to
 agree on changes to its structure.
 Besides the frequent lack of counsel for the accused, other major shortcomings in
 the legal system include the lack of adequate resources and trained personnel and
 an outmoded legal code. Most citizens have lost confidence in the system to provide
 even the most basic protection. This has contributed to the growing level of violence
 as revenge became the method of justice which private citizens carried out for them-
 selves.
 Since the late President Ndadaye's 1993 amnesty decree, there have been no
 clearly identifiable political prisoners. However, police often bring charges of in-
 volvement in violent crimes or disturbance of the peace against detainees in connec-
 tion with political issues.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the right to privacy, and the authorities generally respect
 the law requiring search warrants. Security forces, however, can monitor telephones
 and are commonly assumed to do so.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Incidents of ethnic violence continued to plague the country, including a
 number of neighborhoods in Bujumbura. From March through June, clashes be-
 tween the army and Hutu militants in Bujumbura's Kamenge neighborhood resulted
 in the deaths of between 200 and 300 people, according to credible sources. Many
 homes in Kamenge have been burned or razed. In June alone, the army killed an
 estimated 150 civilians (see Section 1.a.). Thousands of Bujumbura's residents fled
 the capital as a result of this fighting. At present some 5,000 Hutus have returned
 to the Kinama neighborhood of Eujumbura.
 
 
 27
 Violence in Kamenge and other Bujumbura neighborhoods continued throughout
 the year. By the end of the year, only one of Bujumbura's neighborhoods was not
 segregated along ethnic lines. Most Hutus reside on the fringes of the city, while
 Tutsis dominate neighborhoods in town.
 Credible witnesses said that troops pursuing armed Hutu militants killed un-
 armed civilians, including women and children in rural Buumbura, Bubanza,
 Cibitoke, Muyinga, and Bururi provinces. The army, as well as Hutu and Tutsi mili-
 tants, deliberately targeted civilians. A well-informed government official estimated
 that 130,000 people had been displaced in Bubanza province as a result of violence.
 Violence and theft in the countryside has severelyampered the delivery of relief
 upplies and humanitarian assistance. One international relief organization chose
 to deliver relief supplies by air due to lack of security on overland routes.
 In April armed bandits, with the complicity of the army, hjacked trucks with ap-
 proximately 500 metric tons of donated food supplies in Muyinga province. Two
 workers were killed.
 Hutus in the interior attacked displaced Tutsis attempting to return to their
 homes. Military troops on legitimate disarmament operations targeted noncombat-
 ants or destroyed homes, crops, or markets without authorization and often without
 provocation. Displaced Tutsis often with the help of members of the military or
 armed Tutsis militants from tihe capital, attacked Hutus and burned homes in turn,
 maintaining a cycle of retribution.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for the right to free
 opinion and expression so long as these rights are expressed "in a manner consist-
 ent with the public law and order." In practice, the Government respects this provi-
 sional guarantee, but has added new restrictions on what can be said.
 The 1992 Press Law restricts criticism of go.vernment po~icies, the person of the
 President, and statements which the authorities at their discretion could construe
 as contrary to national unity or injurious to the national economy. The law also pro-
 vides for government review and possible ensorship of all media prior to publics-
 tion. Inpractice, private newspapers were published without prior government re-
 view and no cases of seizure were recorded.
 In January the Government enacted a security measure which required that
 "every declaration made by the political parties over the national electronic media
 - . . be submitted to a radio or television journalist" so that it might "be rewritten
 in a professional manner." This measure had negligible results in practice. Although
 political statements read by party leaders were no longer broadcast on television
 and radio, reporting of political rallies with extended excerpts of uncensored par-
 tisan speeches increased.
 In February the Government established a press unit within the public prosecu-
 tor's office to monitor the press. Its purpose was to enforce the 1992 law which re-
 quired daily newspapers to submit for government review two copies of each issue
 4 hours before publication. All other publications were required to submit to the
 Government two copies of each issue at least 24 hours prior to circulation. This law
 was not enforced in practice, and newspapers ignored it with impunity.
 Twenty-five newspapers appeared regularly, in addition to the government-owned
 French-language daily Le Renouvean. There were 13 weekly and 3 monthly French-
 language newspapers. The remainder were Kirundi-language publications. Journal-
 istic standards were low, and most newspapers were simply political party news-
 letters. Others were consistent and energetic organs of ethnic hatred. No newspaper
 was banned or suppressed by authorities. Newspaper readership, however, remained
 limited.
 Most people relied on the two Government-owned radio stations for information.
 One station broadcast in Kirundi, the other in French, Swahili, and English. The
 two stations allowed political parties equal broadcasting opportunities in rotation.
 Some opposition parties complained that the arrangement provided insufficient ac-
 cess. Since 1994 clandestine radio messages, originating from unknown sources and
 broadcasting intermittently, were used by Hutu rebel grups and by Leonard
 Nyangoma to attack the Government and the Tutsi establishment.
 The Civil Code does not address academic freedom. Although no persons were per-
 secuted for what they published or said, the University remains a monoethnic insti-
 tution. Hutu are discouraged from returning by other students.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-A 1991 decree/law established
 guidelines for granting permits for public meetings or parades. The Government
 often denied rally permit applications to the President's Hutu-dominated majority
 FRODEBU party. It claimed that it could not guarantee security. The Government
 did grant opposition parties permits for several public rallies and demonstrations,
 
 
 28
 but it occasionally denied this permission when it alleged that the lead time was
 insufficient to arrange adequate security. Most meetings were subsequently resched-
 uled.
 Unlike the situation in the capital, there were no reports of government harass-
 ment or bureaucratic obstacles to the formation of associations in rural areas. How-
 ever, rural residents other than those gathered in displaced camps did not form as-
 sociations, fearing inadequate government security.
 c. Freedom          n.-The Constitution does provide for freedom of religion.
 There is no state religion, and the Government made no attempt to restrict freedom
 of worship by adherents of any religion. However, in interethnic conflict a number
 of Catholic priests were murdered (see Section L.a.), evidently targets of opposition
 assailants. The Government has scant ability to protect politically targetec clergy.
 Some Tutsi political leaders accused the Catholic Church of supporting the Hutus.
 On September 22, for example, 8 days before the murders of the Italian priests, the
 newspaper of UPRONA, the most important Tutsi-dominated party, published an
 article which claimed that the clergy was "hand-in-hand" with FRODEBU. It also
 accused the Church of being responsible for the formation of FRODEBU, which it
 characterized as a "Nazi party with an ideology of genocide."
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Immigration, and
 Repatriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, but the Government re-
 stricted their exercise. In general, the Government made no attempt to restrict citi-
 zen's travel for political reasons, either internally or abroad. In January, July, and
 December, however, it closed the Bujumbura-Uvira, Zaire, border crossing to both
 Eurundi and Rwandan citizens for 2- to 3-day periods, citing security reasons.
 Political parties and civilian militant groups at times prevented citizens traveling
 to work and to other locations. In February activity in the city of Bujumbura and
 provincial towns including Gitega, Rutana, Ngozi, and Kayanza came to a standstill
 for 3 days when the URONA Party conducted a peaceful protest against the Prime
 Minister. In May Tutsi youths, through violence and intimidation, hindered free
 movement within Bujumbura for 3 days to force the release of fellow youth arrested
 for criminal wrongdoing.
 Movement throughout the country has been restricted by security concerns which
 the Government has not allayed. Increasing banditry and ethnic violence per-
 petrated by armed gangs and the military has rendered travel in the countryside
 perilous. In most of the country, Hutus rarely enter Tutsi areas, and Tutsis rarely
 enter Hutu areas. Military security checkpoints throughout the country effectively
 restrict movement.
 Several hundred thousand Burundian refugees, most of them Hutu, remained in
 Zaire and Tanzania at year's end. Many fled following the presidential assassination
 and coup attempt in October 1993. Others fled as early as 1972; more fled this year.
 As a result of continuing ethnic and political violence, particularly in the north-
 west, little progress was made in repatriating either these refugees or in returning
 the internally displaced persons to their home communes. Citizens continued to flee
 their homes in increasing numbers as a result of the growing violence. This resulted
 in significant increases in the number of internally displaced persons as well as the
 number of Burundian refugees in eastern Zaire and northwestern Tanzania.
 More than half the population of the provinces of Cibitoke, Bubanza, and rural
 Bujumbura were estimated to be either refugees or internally displaced persons.
 The high level of insecurity made it very difficult to assess accurately the number
 of internally displaced people or to provide adequate humanitarian assistance for
 them.
 In June Burundi, Rwanda, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-
 gees formed a tripartite commission to facilitate the return of the more than 200,000
 Rwandan refugees who fled to northern Burundi following the genocide in Rwanda
 in 1994. These refugees, predominantly Hutu, were a growing source of concern to
 the Government, since their presence exacerbated ethnic tensions in the volatile
 northern provinces. The tripartite commission contributed to the voluntary repatri-
 ation of 38,000 of Rwandan refugees.
 In April and May, the army forcibly returned to Rwanda groups of 30 and 500
 refugees respectively. This forced repatriation of refugees was, however, not re-
 peated.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for free, multiparty elections by secret ballot, with a 5-
 year term of office for both the President and members of the National Assembly.
 Citizens exercised this right in 1993, but subsequent events eroded the power of the
 elected Government. Presidential succession negotiations following the October 1993
 
 
 29
 Ndadaye assassination and the April 1994 death of Ntaryamira led to a Convention
 of Government, signed in September 1994. The Convention allows for the Interim
 President to remain in office until June 1998, at which time a new president will
 be elected. National Assembly elections are also scheduled for June 1998.
 There are no legal restrictions on the participation of women or indigenous people
 in elections or politics. In practice, however, both women and ethnic Twa (Pygmies),
 who comprise about 1 percent of the population, are underrepresented  govern-
 ment andpolitics. Women currently hold 2 of 22 Cabinet seats and 9 of 81 National
 Assembly seats. Although the Twa voted in the 1993 elections, none sought political
 office.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestgation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human rihts groups received varying degrees of cooperation from govern-
 ment ministries. The human rights group Iteka continued to operate and publish
 a newsletter on the human rights situation. The Government welcomed inter-
 national human rights groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights
 Watch Africa. The work of suck organizations was hampered, however, by insecurity
 in the countryside and the Government's inability to protect human rights workers.
 An OAU military officer was killed and three other OAU personnel wounded in
 an attack in June on a motor convoy that included a government minister and the
 US. ambassador (see Section L.a.). In September an ambush of an OAU vehicle -
 travelling in Karuzi province resulted in the death of the Burundian driver and the
 wounding of a Burundian soldier. The OAU subsequently suspended operations in
 Karuzi province. In May a Greek relief worker was murdered in Kirundo province
 (see Section l.a.).
 Local military authorities, often acting independently, frequently refused access to
 human rights and international aid workers. Militant extremists, both Hutu and
 Tutsi, threatened the lives of people investigating human rights violations. Some
 international human rights organizations expressed concern at a lack of government
 support in the face of such adversity.
 An international commission of inquiry was established to investigate the October
 1993 assassination of President Ndadaye and its violent aftermath. Burundi au-
 thorities first requested such a commission in late 1993 and formally set forth the
 request in the September 1994 Convention of Government. In August the Govern-
 ment informed the United Nations Security Council that it was willing to work with
 an international commission of inquiry. Later in August, the U.N. Security Council
 adopted Resolution 1012 requesting the U.N. Secretary General to establish this
 commission. In October the members of the Commission arrived in Burundi, but
 poor security initially hampered their work. Security for the Commission is being
 improve d.
 The U.N sent a fact-finding mission in February. The Government allowed Am-
 nesty International to send delegations to Burundi in March and May. Numerous
 other international human rights organizations sent missions to Burundi.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution explicitly provides equal status and protection for all citizens,
 without distinction based on sex, origin, ethnicity, religion, or opinion. However, the
 Government failed to enforce effectively all the Constitution's provisions.
 Women.-Violence against women occurred, but there was no documentation of its
 extent. Wives have the right to bring physical abuse charges against their hus-
 bands; in practice they rarely do so. Police do not normally intervene in domestic
 disputes, and the press does not report incidents of violence against women, includ-
 ing rape. There were no known court cases dealing with abuse of women.
 Women hold a secondary place in society and face both legal and societal discrimi-
 nation. Explicitly discriminatory inheritance laws and discriminatory financial cred-
 it practices remained unchanged. Although women by law must receive the same
 p ay as men for the same jobs, women are far less likely to hold any mid- or high-
 level positions. In rural areas, women traditionally perform hard farm work and
 have less opportunity for education than men.
 Children.-The Government has taken no action to protect children's rights, nor
 has it addressed the growing problem of the increasing population of orphans which
 resulted from the continued violence since 1993. Children have not been spared by
 belligerents in the civil conflict; many of the victims of massacres have been chil-
 dren.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government has not enacted legislation or other-
 wise mandated access to buildings or government services for people with disabil-
 
 
 ities. Burundi's rudimentary economy effectively excludes the physically disabled
 from many types of employment.
 Indigenous. People.-The Twa (Pygmy) minority remained almost completely
 marginalized-economically, socially, and politically. Most Twa continued to live in
 isolation, uneducated, and without access to government services, including health
 care. The Twa voted in the 1993 election, but were otherwise outside the political
 process.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Burundi's fundamental problem continued
 to be ethnic conflict between the majority Hutus who gained political power only
 with the election of Ndadaye, and the minority futsis, who have historically held
 power and still control the military and dominate educated society. De facto ethnic
 discrimination against Hutus-85 percent of the population--colors every facet of so-
 ciety and institutions, including the military and the judicial establishment, despite
 constitutional provisions and some policies introduced under the Buyoya military
 administration to attract Hutus into the professions.
 The Ndadaye Administration upon assuming office began a more concerted effort
 to put Hutus into the government bureaucracy. Those policy changes quickly led to
 increased tensions between long-term Tutsi professionals and the FRODEBU Gov-
 ernment. Anonymous threats and assassinations of Hutu ministers and government
 officials took place under Ndadaye and continued this year. Tutsi students have inti-
 mated Hutu students that University of Burundi. There are almost no Hutus in at-
 tendance at the University.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the Labor Code nominally pro-
 tect the rights of workers to form unions, although the military, the gendarmerie,
 and certain expatriates working in the public sector are prohibited from union par-
 ticipation. Most workers are urban civil servants.
 Since gaining its independence from the Government in 1992, the country's first
 national umbrella trade union, the Organization of Free Unions of Burundi (CSB)
 has been financially dependent on a system of voluntary checkoffs, as are locaI
 unions. The CSB represented labor in collective bargaining negotiations in coopera-
 tion with individual labor unions. Unions are Tutsi-dominated, reflecting the fact
 that it is mainly Tutsi who are employed in the formal sector of the economy.
 The Labor Code permits the formation of additional unions or confederations out-
 side the CSB. In March a second national umbrella trade union, the Confederation
 of Unions of Burundi (COSBYU), was formed. COSBYU represents eight national
 unions. The Teachers' Union was the only union outside the two umbrella trade
 union organizations this year.
 When settling disputes in which more than one labor union is represented, the
 law stipulates that the Minister of Labor will chose the union representing the
 greatest number of workers to participate in the negotiations.
 Unions are able to affiliate with international organizations. The Labor Code also
 provides workers with a restricted right to strike. Restrictions on the right to strike
 and lockout are several: the action must be taken only after exhausting all other
 peaceful means of resolution; negotiations must continue during the action, medi-
 ated by a mutually agreeable party or by the Government; and 6 days' notice must
 be given. The law prohibits retribution against workers participating in a legal
 strike an dthis prvision is upheld in practice.
 Three nationwide strikes took place this year. In July the National Teachers and
 Nurses Union went on strike to demand higher salaries. The strikers were unsuc-
 cessful and after discussions with the Government returned to work.
 The two other major strikes were tied to the political situation. Employees of the
 National Institute of Social Security struck in August to demand the dismissal of
 the Institute's director of finance, whom they accused of mismanagement. The em-
 ployees also demanded the formation of a new board of directors. The Institute's di-
 rector of finance was Hutu and a FRODEBU member, while the striking employees
 were mostly Tutsis and members of UPRONA, the most important Tutsi-doniinated
 party. Although the director of finance did not formally resign, he stopped work in
 S eptember. In the same month, employees resumed work as negotiations on the
 board of directors continued.
 In August employees of the National Office of Telecommunications (Onatel), who
 were mostly Tutsi, struck to demand the dismissal of Onatel's four executive direc-
 tors, all Hutus, whom they accused of mismanagement. The employees also de-
 manded the formation of a new bard of directors. Onatel's employees resumed work
 in September after a new board of directors was formed and three of the four execu-
 tive directors were dismissed. The only executive director who retained his position
 
 
 belonged to the UPRONA Party. The three who were dismissed were members of
 different Hutu-dominated political parties.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code recognizes
 the right to collective bargaining, which had formeily been acknowledged only by
 ordinance. Since most workers are civil servants, government entities are involved
 in almost every phase of labor negotiations.
 Public sector wages are set in fixed scales in individual work contracts and are
 not affected by collective bargaining. In the private sector, wage scales also exist but
 individual contract negotiation is possible. In principle, private sector wage scales
 can also be influenced by collective bargaining, although this is infrequent.
 The Labor Code gives the Labor Court jurisdiction over all labor dispute cases
 including those involving public employees. Labor negotiations are still conducted
 largely between unions and employers under the supervision of the tripartite Na-
 tional Labor Council, the Government's highest consultative authority on labor is-
 sues. The Council represents government, labor, and management and is presided
 over and regulated by the Mimster of Labor.
 The Labor Code prohibits employers from firing or otherwise discriminating
 against a worker because of union affiliation or activity. This right is upheld in
 practice.
 There are no export processing zones, although a decree/law making the entire
 country a free zone for many nontraditional, export-oriented activities was promul-
 gated in 1992.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsoy labor, and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code states that chil-
 dren under the age of 16 are not allowed to be employed by "an enterprise" even
 as apprentices, although it also states that they may undertake occasional work
 which does not damage their health or interfere with their schooling. In practice,
 in rural areas children under age 16 do heavy manual labor such as transporting
 bricks in daytime during the school year.
 Children are legall prohibited from working at night, although many do so in the
 informal sector. Children are obliged by custom and economic necessity to help sup-
 port their families by participating in activities related to subsistence agriculture in
 famy-based enterprises and the informal sector.
 e. Acceptable Conlitions of Work.-aThe formal minimum wage for unskilled work-
 ers is *0.58 (145 Burundi francs) per day in Bujumbura and Gitega and $0.48 (120
 Burundi francs) in the rest of the country, with a graduated scale for greater skill
 levels. This amount does not allow a worker and family to maintain a decent stand-
 ard of living, and most families rely on second incomes and subsistence agriculture
 to supplement their earnings. Employees working under a contract, particularly in
 urban areas, generally earn significantly more than the minimum wage. All employ-
 ees in the public sector work under contract. The CSB estimates that 70 percent
 of employees working in the formal private sector are covered by a contract.
 The Labor Code imposes a maximum 8-hour workday and 45-hour workweek, ex-
 cept in cases when workers are involved in activities related to national security.
 Supplements must be paid for overtime. The Labor Code establishes health and
 safety standards requ iring an employer to provide a safe workplace and assigns en-
 forcement responsibiity to the Ministry of Labor. However, the Ministry does not
 enforce the code effectively. Health and safety articles in the Labor Code do not di-
 rectly address workers' right to remove themselves from a dangerous work situation.
