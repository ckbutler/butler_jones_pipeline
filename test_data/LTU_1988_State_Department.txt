 LITHUANIA
 Lithuania, the largest of the three Baltic states, was
 forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union as a constituent republic
 of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.) in 1940
 after having enjoyed independence between the two World Wars.
 The United States does not recognize this forced incorporation
 of Lithuania into the U.S.S.R.
 In general, Lithuania is subjected to the same centralized
 rule, the same constitution and judicial system, the same
 restrictions on civil and political liberties, and the same
 police controls as in the Soviet Union. The policies of
 "glasnost" (openness) and "perestroika" (restructuring)
 adopted by General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, however, have
 enabled Lithuanians to become active proponents of national,
 civil, and human rights. Under the leadership of new
 unofficial organizations such as the Lithuanian Movement in
 Support of Perestroika (Sajudis), Lithuanians pressed the
 Lithuanian Communist Party leadership to allow the display of
 national symbols, the open discussion of ecological and
 economic issues, and publication of articles concerning
 Lithuania's occupation by the Soviet Union in 1940. The
 non-Lithuanian segment of the population is now estimated at
 about 20 percent.
 As in the other Baltic states, the standard of living in
 Lithuania is somewhat higher than the Soviet average.
 Agricultural and industrial production increased in 1988, but
 Soviet redistribution policies continued to force Lithuanian
 living standards down toward lower Soviet levels. A key
 concern for Lithuanians is air and water pollution and acid
 rain caused by oil burning power plants, chemical and other
 industries, trucks and automobiles, and nuclear power plants.
 The principal concern regarding nuclear power plants, however,
 is that another Chernobyl-type accident could render the
 Lithuanian homeland uninhabitable.   The environmental
 movement was active in 1988 in publicizing the problems facing
 the region.
 The human rights situation improved markedly in 1988. Although
 the authorities violated the human rights of independence
 advocates and religious and other activists, they usually
 tolerated public demonstrations of national sentiment and
 independent political opinion. Promised changes in the
 various Soviet criminal codes, which is the basis for the
 authorities' actions against human rights activists, have not
 yet occurred. Thus, the government apparatus for the
 repression of dissidents and activists remains intact and
 could be employed in the event of a change in policy or
 leadership in Moscow, a possibility which concerns Lithuanian
 activists.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known cases of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known instances of permanent or prolonged
 disappearances.

 LITHUANIA
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Prisoners are frequently mistreated during interrogation or
 confinement in labor camps, prisons, or psychiatric hospitals.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Soviet laws are written and interpreted so broadly that persons
 may be arrested and convicted for trying to exercise their
 basic human rights. Persons accused of publishing or
 distributing underground publications may be sentenced to
 prison or labor camp, exiled, or be committed to psychiatric
 hospitals. In 1988, however, there were no known cases of
 persons being convicted on the basis of the "political"
 articles in the criminal code. This represents a major step
 forward in improving the human rights environment.
 The number of arbitrary arrests, detentions, and exiles
 substantially decreased in 1988, in accordance with Soviet
 Communist Party General Secretary Gorbachev's campaign for
 more "openness" in and "democratization" of Soviet society.
 This has resulted in more latitude for Lithuanians to express
 their views and to criticize their Government. The
 authorities continued to review the Soviet criminal codes,
 ostensibly with a view to eliminating some of the "political"
 articles which have been used as legal justification for
 arbitrary arrests, but no corrective action had been taken by
 year's end. According to human rights activists, only a few
 persons remain imprisoned under Lithuanian criminal statutes.
 Several activists were detained during 1988 for organizing-
 demonstrations to commemorate historical events. The
 authorities detained more than 30 people to prevent their
 participation in the commemoration of the February 16
 anniversary of Lithuanian independence, including Petras
 Cidzikas, Vytautas Bogusis, Nijole Sadunaite, and Antanas
 Terneckas. Several of those arrested were also beaten.
 Several other activists, including Algimantas Andreika,
 Eugenius Krukovskis, and Antanas Terleckas, were among those
 arrested for participating in unauthorized demonstrations in
 Vilnius and Kaunas on May 22, June 14, and June 16.
 As 1988 progressed, the situation improved. Persons arrested
 for participating in'a September'28 demonstration were ordered
 released by the judge, an unusual demonstration of judicial
 independence in a country where courts are usually expected to
 rubberstamp actions and accusations by-the police and the
 Committee for State Security (KGB). Moreover, some prominent
 political prisoners were released in 1988, including Catholic
 activist Alfonsas Svarinskas, who was pardoned by the
 Presidium of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet on June 28 and
 received an exit visa on August 1. Lithuanian human rights
 activists Gintautus Iesmantas and Father Sigitas Tamkevicius
 state that former political prisoners Jonas Bagdonas, Arvydas
 Cekanavicius, Henrikas Klimasauskas, and K. Muzikevicius, were
 released in 1988.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.d.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 As in the Soviet Union, the Lithuanian Communist Party in
 political cases often subverts constitutional provisions for
 the objectivity and independence of the judicial process. In
 
 
 1120
 LITHUANIA
 such cases, the self-determined compelling needs of the State
 override the rights of a defendant. Some Lithuanian leaders
 spoke out in 1988 for strengthening the rights of defendants
 in Soviet trials, but it is as yet unclear whether or how such
 reforms will be implemented.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Through the use of informers, mail censorship, electronic
 monitoring of telephones, and other devices, government
 authorities have the ability, widely exercised, to interfere
 in every aspect of personal life. Constitutional provisions
 to the contrary, Soviet investigative agencies do not abstain
 from forced entry and illegal searches. Surveillance of
 persons suspected of nationalist activity continues to be
 pervasive. Interference with mail and telephone communications
 appeared to diminish during 1988, although telephone service
 to some activists has been interfered with, particularly
 during national holidays.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for most internationally accepted
 political liberties as long as their exercise accords with the
 strengthening and security of the "Socialist" system. In
 practice, the authorities interpret these constitutional
 guarantees to fit the convenience of the State. While General
 Secretary Gorbachev's glasnost' campaign has expanded
 considerably the ability of persons to criticize past Soviet
 leaders and policies, the authorities continue to be sensitive
 to any criticism of the present leadership.
 The ability of private citizens to express opinions at
 variance with the party line has nonetheless been greatly
 expanded, and such previously banned topics as the status of
 Lithuania as a Soviet republic can now be discussed with some
 degree of candor. Additionally, a citizen group called the
 Lithuanian Movement in Support of Perestroika (Sajudis) began
 openly publishing two journals not under control of the
 Communist Party. Sajudis and other groups publicly support
 increased autonomy for Lithuania. Various underground
 publications continue to appear in Lithuania, but the opinions
 which they contain are increasingly expressed openly.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right to peaceful assembly is controlled by the
 authorities who, under a decree of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet
 of July 28, 1988, retain the right to deny all public
 gatherings. In practice, however, the authorities have been
 more permissive than in the past in allowing public
 demonstrations. The largest nonparty gathering in recent
 Lithuanian history was the rally organized by the Atgaja
 Ecological Club and attended by up to 500,000 people in Kaunas
 to discuss the deteriorating environment in Lithuania. Other
 gatherings organized by Sajudis took place in Vilnius. On
 July 9, some 100,000 people gathered to hear the report from
 Lithuanian delegates to the June 1988 XIX Communist Party
 Conference. On August 23, as many as 200,000 people gathered
 in Vingis Park in Vilnius to protest the 1939 signing of the
 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which led to the annexation of
 Lithuania by the Soviet Union. Although the authorities have
 
 
 1121
 LITHUANIA
 denounced some of the activities of Sajudis in the press, they
 did not attempt to break up either of these demonstrations,
 and Lithuanian Communist Party First Secretary Algirdas
 Brazauskas addressed the constituent congress of the
 organization in October.
 The right of association is provided for in the Constitution,
 but the authorities strictly control all associations and
 organizations. Sajudis's activities were generally tolerated
 by the authorities. Other groups, such. as the Lithuanian
 Liberty League, which advocates complete independence for
 Lithuania, have experienced greater harassment from government
 security organs. For example, the police-broke up a
 demonstration in Vilnius in September by some 10,000 people
 marking the anniversary of the signing of amendments to the
 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The Liberty League nonetheless
 was allowed to continue functioning openly since its July
 emergence from 10 years of underground activity. A "rolling"
 hunger strike by the League in Vilnius on behalf of political
 prisoners was allowed to proceed, albeit with some opposition
 and official harrassment. The political prisoners whose
 release was being demanded by the hunger strikers were: Balys
 Gajauskas, Petras Grazulis, Gintautus Iesmantas, Voldemaras
 Karoliunas, Boleslavas Liziunas, Jonas Pakuckas, Viktoras
 Petkus, and Father Sigitas Tamkevicius. The above prisoners
 were convicted, for the most part, on charges of anti-Soviet
 activity, usually for nationalist activity or for attempting
 to leave the country. By the time the hunger strike ended,
 all but Liziunas had been released.
 For a discussion of the freedom of association as it applies
 to labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Despite constitutional guarantees, religious activists are
 subject to systematic harassment. Soviet authorities attempt
 to control all religious activities, with special emphasis on
 the work of the Lithuanian Catholic Church. Soviet officials
 reportedly have taken control of church committees and
 excluded priests from some of these bodies. Because of
 officially imposed limits on admissions to Kaunas Seminary,
 Lithuania's only theological seminary, over 100 parishes are
 said to be without a permanently assigned pastor. The
 Government also interferes in the administration and
 admissions process of the seminary. All religious orders are
 banned.
 Pressure on the Catholic Church nonetheless eased during
 1988. Several Lithuanian bishops were allowed to visit the
 Vatican, and Bishop Vincentas Sladkevicius of Kaisiadorys was
 elevated to the rank of cardinal in May and appointed
 president of the Episcopal Conference of Lithuania. The Queen
 of Peace Catholic Church in Klaipeda, which was confiscated by
 the authorities in the 1960's, is being returned to the
 Catholic Church. Twenty-seven new priests have been
 consecrated, the largest number since 1948. In October
 Lithuanian Communist Party chief Algirdas Brazauskas agreed to
 return Vilnius Cathedral, which the authorities had converted
 into an art gallery in 1950, to the Catholic Church. Tens of
 thousands of Lithuanians celebrated the decision in a march to
 the cathedral. Brauzaukas also announced that a cathedral
 which has long served as the Museum of Atheism of the
 Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic would be returned to the
 Church's control.
 
 
 1122
 LITHUANIA
 Believers are no longer routinely harassed to prevent them
 from attending church services. For the first time in the
 postwar period, Christmas was celebrated in Lithuania as an
 officially sanctioned holiday. Christmas eve mass in Vilnius
 was broadcast on television.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 In Lithuania, as in the Soviet Union, the authorities do not
 respect the right of emigration. Permission to emigrate from
 Lithuania is subject to tight restrictions and granted
 arbitrarily. The authorities often harass Lithuanians known
 to be seeking permission to emigrate by denying them work in
 their specialty, by excluding them from educational
 institutions, and by other punitive measures. Nonetheless,
 the increase in the issuance of exit permits from the Soviet
 Union during 1988 has resulted in the emigration of an
 increased number of Lithuanian Jews, and some Lithuanian
 activists were also able to depart for the West. Others,
 particularly Lithuanian nationalist activists, have been
 encouraged to emigrate by the authorities who want to rid
 themselves of 'troublemakers." Some have been threatened with
 exile to Siberia in order to encourage them to emigrate. On
 the other hand, those who attempt to emigrate illegally are
 usually punished. Three people who attempted to cross the
 frontier into Finland this year, Gintautas and Mechislovas
 Tarasevicius, and Richardas Andrilauskas, were confined in a
 mental hospital for 4 months. They were released in
 mid-September and allowed to return home.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 *to Change Their Government
 Citizens are not free to change the government leadership or
 the system of government. The Communist Party continues to
 hold a monopoly on political power, but the informal group
 Sajudis, which is said to number over 100,000 members, has
 exerted some influence over recent party and government
 decisions. As a result of the efforts of Sajudis, the
 Lithuanian Supreme Soviet adopted the national flag and anthem
 of the former independent republic as the state flag and
 anthem of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. The
 Government also allowed Sajudis representatives, which include
 non-Communists as well as Communist Party members, to sit in
 on some policy decisionmaking sessions. In addition, the
 organization stated its intention to run independent
 candidates for election to the local, republican, and
 All-Union soviets (councils), which are due to be held in
 1989. Sajudis representatives, nonetheless, were the target
 of hostile criticism by government officials and of KGB
 surveillance. Communist party officials, unaccustomed to
 political activity outside the party, only reluctantly allowed
 Sajudis to continue to operate, probably because of its mass
 appeal.
 Women do not play a large role in the Lithuanian Communist
 Party or in political life.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Soviet Government has created an Administration for
 Humanitarian and Cultural Relations in the U.S.S.R. Foreign
 
 
 1123
 LITHUANIA
 Ministry, which has carried out detailed discussions with
 foreign representatives of human rights cases in the Soviet
 Union. As a result of these discussions, additional
 information has been obtained on a number of Lithuanians who
 are under detention, and Soviet agreement to release certain
 prisoners was obtained. The attitude of the Lithuanian
 Government toward investigation of human rights complaints is
 basically negative.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or other grounds is
 prohibited in the Constitution. The relative homogeneity of
 Lithuania's population, its strong sense of national identity,
 and the binding force of the Lithuanian Catholic Church have
 helped to preserve many of the country's social and cultural
 traditions. Nevertheless, the disruptive effects of an
 antireligious ideology, forced collectivization, and a policy
 of industrialization have been severe. Lithuanians complain
 that immigrant (non-Lithuanian) workers get priority for
 scarce housing while local residents must wait for years to
 get new apartments.
 Women nominally enjoy the same legal rights as men, and an
 extensive system of day-care service and maternity benefits
 enables women to obtain and retain employment outside the
 home. However, women generally hold less remunerative
 positions than men do in the same occupations.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Soviet labor law and practice are enforced in Lithuania.
 There is no right of association as defined by the
 International Labor Organization. Although the Constitution
 grants citizens the right to form trade unions, any attempt to
 exercise this right independently of the state-controlled
 unions is repressed. Given Soviet concern that the ideas of
 the Polish Solidarity trade union movement might spread, this
 has been especially true in Lithuania, which has close
 historical ties to Poland and most of whose population, as in
 Poland, are members of the Catholic Church.
 Workers do not have the right to strike.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers in Lithuania may not organize or resort to collective
 bargaining. There are no economic incentive zones or special
 industries in which labor standards differ from those
 elsewhere in Lithuania.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Most prisoners are confined to camps where they are forced to
 labor, often under harsh and degrading conditions.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The statutory minimum for employment of children is 16, and
 the standard workweek is 40 hours. There is no indication of
 widespread violation of these norms.
 
 
 1124
 LITHUANIA
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Labor conditions in Lithuania are similar to those in the
 Soviet Union. According to the Soviet State Statistical
 Committee, the average monthly wage in the U.S.S.R. for blue-
 and white-collar workers in mid-1988 was $350 and for
 collective farm workers $250 at the official exchange rate.
 The minimum monthly wage in the U.S.S.R. was $132. (The ruble
 is not a convertible currency, and its value here in terms of
 the U.S. dollar does not represent actual purchasing power for
 international purposes.) Although specific information is not
 available, average wages in Lithuania are believed to be
 higher than average wages in the U.S.S.R. as a whole.
 The average workweek is 40 hours for most white-collar workers
 and 48 hours for most blue-collar workers. Soviet law
 establishes minimum conditions of health and safety. Press
 reports suggest, however, that the laws on maximum hours of
 work and health and safety standards are widely ignored.
