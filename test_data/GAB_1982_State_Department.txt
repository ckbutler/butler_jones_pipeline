 GABON
 Gabon has a single-party political system with power centralized
 in the presidency. This office has been held since 1967 by
 President Omar Bongo, who was reconfirmed in 1973 and again in
 1979 in national referenda. A 93-member National Assembly
 chosen from a single-party slate functions regularly but has
 little real power. Opposition political parties are not per-
 mitted. There are cases, however, where contested local or
 parliamentary elections have resulted in the election of candi-
 dates not supported by the party hierarchy. The Government has
 sought to build a political consensus by bringing all ethnic and
 political groups under the umbrella of the party.
 The country has a constitution which guarantees basic protection
 of the individual and respect for the integrity of the person.
 These rights are generally respected in practice. A legal
 system based upon French civil law, customary law, and the 1961
 Constitution functions fairly effectively. Political rights
 are not guaranteed under the Constitution, and active political
 opposition is not permitted. Public criticism of particular
 government actions and policies is allowed and occurs with some
 regularity, although direct attacks on the President are prohi-
 bited. The Gabonese press has taken issue with actions of gov-
 ernment agencies and criticized ministers. Foreign periodicals
 containing articles critical of the Government generally circu-
 late freely.
 The principal political event in the last year was the arrest
 of approximately 30 individuals in late 1981 and early 1982 for
 organizing an opposition party, the Movement for National Re-
 covery (MORENA); are charged with acts against the public order,
 including insults to the chief of state. These are the first
 arrests for political opposition in several years. In November
 1982 the Government tried these arrestees in an open trial in
 accord with the Gabonese Constitution and sentenced some of them
 to long prison terms.
 Although still a developing country, Gabon has the highest
 per capita income in sub-Saharan Africa due largely to its
 important petroleum and mineral resources and limited population.
 Economic performance has also benefited from long-standing
 government policies supporting private enterprise and encouraging
 foreign investment. While income distribution is skewed in
 favor of the modern urban sector as opposed to the traditional,
 agricultural sector, most Gabonese have benefited from the
 country's strong economic growth. Despite this year's well-
 publicized political trials and a public execution of convicted
 murderers, human rights conditions in Gabon remained basically
 unchanged in 1982 in comparison with those of recent years.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There have been no reports of political executions by the Govern-
 ment or by opponents of the Government in recent years.
 b. Disappearance
 Names and details of the December 1981 and March 1982 arrests of
 political dissidents were released slowly but were acknowledged
 by the Government and have been discussed publicly. No reports
 of other, unacknowledged disappearances have been received.

 c. Torture
 Amnesty International reports that in recent years political de-
 tainees held by a number of national security and constabulary
 units have been tortured. The periodical "New African" published
 in London cites the case of a mining engineer tortured with elec-
 tric shocks while in prison during 1982 for anti-government demon-
 strations.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Although prisons are generally spartan and crowded, most prison-
 ers are permitted visits by family members and can obtain medical
 attention when required. In its 1982 report, covering events in
 1981, Amnesty International stated that it had received reports
 that some of the persons detained in late 1981 for political
 activity had been badly beaten in detention. During their public
 trial, the MORENA defendants complained of cramped cells and
 inadequate food; two stated they had been beaten by guards.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The roughly 30 persons arrested in late 1981 and early 1982 were
 the first arrests for political activity in some years. Some of
 these were held incommunicado for weeks without their cases being
 referred to the courts, in violation of the Code of Penal Proce-
 dure. There have been recent reports of the arrest of a promi-
 nent academic cleric on charges of illegal political activity.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is guaranteed by the Gabonese
 Constitution and has generally been respected in practice. The
 trial in November 1982 of the 37 political detainees was conduct-
 ed in accordance with the laws of Gabon, and the defendants re-
 ceived the normal due process provided under the Gabonese legal
 system. The defendants were provided with lawyers throughout
 the trial, were given sufficient time to confer with the lawyers,
 and were permitted to present a defense to the charges brought by
 the prosecution.
 The court sessions were open and attended by overflow crowds
 composed heavily of family and supporters of the accused. The
 trial sessions were reported factually and in detail by the
 local press and TV (both government-owned), including defense
 statements. French journalists and a representative of Amnesty
 International also attended the trial. No special or military
 courts with jurisdiction over civilians have been convened in
 recent years.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 A report published in Europe asserts that the homes of suspected
 MORENA sympathizers have been searched in nighttime raids intend-
 ed to uncover stolen military arms, but this has not been veri-
 fied.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There are limitations on freedom of speech in Gabon. However,
 with the exception of public attacks on the President, criticism
 of government policies and action is permitted and occurs with
 some regularity. One of the most popular local television shows
 is a weekly live press conference in which government ministers
 
 
 113
 and their staffs respond to questions phoned in by viewers.
 While it is not known if all questions are aired, government
 officials are often presented with hostile or embarrassing ques-
 tions. The country's one daily newspaper, although government-
 controlled, occasionally features articles critical of specific
 government activities. Foreign periodicals with articles criti-
 cal of the Government normally circulate freely. Freedom of
 press and speech in Gabon does not extend to organized political
 activity in opposition to the single political party.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The only political assembly permitted is under the auspices of
 the country's single party, which organizes occasional mass ral-
 lies to publicize and support government policies. Labor unions
 also are affiliated with the party, but strikes occur occa-
 sionally.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution guarantees the free practice of religion, and a
 policy of religious tolerance is followed in practice. Christian,
 Muslim, and animist religions all flourish in Gabon.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Domestic travel is for the most part unrestricted in Gabon.
 However, the identity cards of persons moving around the capital
 have been checked more frequently since the emergence of the
 movement to create another political party. In the 1960's and
 early 1970's a number of political opponents went into exile. In
 some cases, and notably that of former Prime Minister Jean-Hilare
 Aubame, President Bongo has publicly guaranteed their safety if
 they return. International travel is unimpeded except for common
 immigration controls.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Participation in the political process is restricted by the
 Constitution to the single authorized political party, the Demo-
 cratic Party of Gabon and its affiliated organizations. Presi-
 dent Bongo has followed a domestic policy aimed at building a
 broad political consensus by encouraging participation in the
 Party by all ethnic groups and by virtually all political persua-
 sions. The cabinet is chosen so as to be representative of the
 ethnic diversity of the country. Under the single party system,
 presidential elections in Gabon have not been contested. Elect-
 ions for the National Assembly do feature competing candidates
 under the umbrella of the Party. Basic national policy is de-
 termined by the President in consultation with the cabinet.
 Within these broad guidelines, some political debate goes on
 within the Government and Party over specific actions and priori-
 ties. The role of the Prime Minister has recently been strength-
 ened by giving him added responsibility as head of government.
 Women are integrated into all levels of political and economic
 activity. The extent of their participation is limited by
 cultural factors but not by any element of the Gabonese political
 or legal system.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Amnesty International expressed concern about the arrests of the
 
 
 114
 30 political dissidents reported above shortly after they oc-
 curred. President Bongo subsequently invited Amnesty Inter-
 national to send a mission to Gabon to investigate the situation
 firsthand. While a formal mission was not sent, the organization
 reportedly was able to gather information through its repre-
 sentatives in Gabon and from other sources. A representative of
 Amnesty International attended their trial.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Gabon has considerable natural resources, including petroleum,
 manganese, uranium, and forest products. Given these resources,
 government policy encouraging private enterprise and foreign
 investment, the country has for many years enjoyed relatively
 high levels of export earnings and economic growth. Gabon
 has one of the highest per capita income' levels in Africa.
 The exact level is unclear, since recent surveys indicate
 the population is larger than estimates published by various
 international organizations. A recent government census put
 the population level at 1.2 million. Based on 1981 GDP figures,
 this would give a per capita GDP of $3,100 at the 1981 exchange
 rate. In any event, it is clear that Gabon is one of the few
 prosperous countries on a continent where most nations are facing
 critical economic problems.
 Despite its strong economic record, Gabon faces the problem common
 in developing countries of trying to integrate the modern sector
 of the economy with the traditional sector based on semi-subsist-
 ence agriculture. The traditional sector in Gabon confronts many
 of the same economic and social problems faced by the poorer
 countries in the region and, as is true elsewhere, income distri-
 bution is skewed strongly in favor of the modern urban sector.
 The Government is attempting to ensure further economic growth
 and a more equitable distribution of national income through
 public investment in social services (especially education and
 medicine), in infrastructure, and assistance to agricultural
 development. The right of both men and women to hold private
 property is spelled out in the Constitution and is scrupulously
 upheld. Pay scales are relatively high by African standards; the
 minimum wage is about $160 per month. There is little unemploy-
 ment among Gabonese who wish to enter the wage economy. While
 some corruption exists, the problem is not a major one for
 Gabonese society.
 Urban women are found in increasing numbers in government, in the
 professions, and in politics, although their presence in business
 life remains limited. In rural areas cultural factors tend to
 limit women to their traditional role in agriculture. In both
 rural and urban areas the role of women as homemakers is still
 dominant. By African standards Gabon has a low natural popula-
 tion growth rate (around 2 percent), but this has been augmented
 by immigration from neighboring countries. Life expectancy has
 risen from 40.2 years in 1970 to 44.5 years in 1980. The infant
 mortality rate, while still substantial (116 per 1000 live
 births), has dropped below the level of neighboring countries.
 The ratio of available calorie supply relative to nutritional
 requirements is reported by the World Bank as 104 percent. There
 is no evidence of malnutrition due to non-availability of food.
 However, lack of knowledge of good nutritional practices for
 children in the traditional sector is a problem. The World
 Bank has reported that 202 percent of the primary school-age
 population is attending school. This figure is believed to
 reflect an underestimation of the total population, but the
 point that nearly all school-age children are attending school
 
 
 115
 is considered valid. Rural school construction remains a high
 government priority as is the recruitment and training of Gabo-
 nese teachers (many are now foreign). Government policy on
 economic and social needs for Gabonese nationals is implemented
 on a non-discriminatory basis.
