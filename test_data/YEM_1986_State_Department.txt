 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 The military has played a preeminent role in the Yemen Arab
 Republic (YAR) since the 1962 revolution which overthrew the
 theocratic Imamate and opened the YAR to the world. The
 current Government was largely shaped and influenced by
 8 years of civil war followed by political turbulence which
 persists in the south Arabian region. The Government remains
 unable to extend its full authority over the entire country,
 much of which is isolated by rugged terrain. Tribal leaders
 in the outlying areas have been reluctant to give up their
 traditional authority.
 The current leader of the YAR, Colonel Ali Abdullah Salih,
 assumed office in 1978 following the assassination, within
 8 months, of his two immediate predecessors, both of whom came
 from the senior ranks of the army. No ranking national
 government official currently serving in office has been
 elected in a truly competitive process, and President Salih
 relies heavily on military and security forces to maintain his
 Government in power. There are unconfirmed reports that Salih
 has escaped several attempts on his life. An invasion by its
 neighbor, the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY), in
 1979 was followed by an insurgency by the National Democratic
 Front.(NDF), a Marxist group created by the PDRY. Fighting
 continued until 1982. A violent coup in the PDRY in January
 1986 has contributed to YAR security concerns. Thousands of
 political exiles now live just inside the YAR border with the
 PDRY. As a consequence of these developments, fears about
 state security have created an atmosphere which has not been
 conducive to improving human rights and which has slowed the
 evolution of more democratic institutions.
 The YAR is a poor country with a limited industrial
 infrastructure. Remittances from Yemeni workers abroad are a
 major source of foreign exchange. A sharp drop in these
 remittances has caused the Government to intervene to limit
 the outflow of foreign exchange, a step which is contrary to
 its usual laissez-faire policies.
 There was little change in the state of human rights in 1986.
 However, the potential for increased violence exists.
 Continued unrest in the PDRY has resulted in concern over the
 possible resumption of NDF activity in the YAR. More than
 15,000 PDRY refugees, many of them military professionals,
 were in the YAR by the end of 1986, and the number is expected
 to grow. In the wake of this development, security forces
 have been particularly active in the border areas and in
 Sanaa. Detention without charges and other abuses have
 occurred. The National Security Organization (NSO), charged
 with protecting the Government from subversion, has inevitably
 gained in power and influence.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports that government forces executed
 individuals for their political beliefs. There was a
 terrorist attack against a member of the U.S. Embassy staff in
 April. There were also unconfirmed reports of armed attacks
 by the NDF on YAR security forces and exiles in the border
 areas.

 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 b. Disappearance
 There were continuing reports of secrmt arrests by national
 security officials. In rural areas, there were also reports
 that both government security forces and tribesmen resorted to
 hostage-taking. There were also several reports of kidnaping
 for purposes of intimidation. The persons abducted were
 eventually released unharmed.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The YAR Constitution, the National Charter, and Yemeni legal
 statutes all proscribe the use of torture. However, security
 authorities reportedly continue to resort with impunity to
 force and intimidation to extract information or confessions
 from persons accused of criminal activity, particularly where
 matters of security are believed involved. Most informed
 Yemenis believe that the NSO engages in torture on occasion.
 The Yemeni legal code is based on Islamic Shari'a law which
 calls for such punishments as amputation and stoning, but
 these penalties are now. rarely applied. Harsh conditions
 prevail in most Yemeni jails, but some prisoners are able to
 receive food, clothing, and medicine from their families.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There were continuing reports of arbitrary arrest. Prisoners
 were also held without charge for extended periods despite
 provisions of the Constitution which limit the time police may
 hold suspects without explicit judicial authorization.
 Established procedures through which detainees may contact
 their families and lawyers are not always observed. Legal
 safeguards are sometimes ignored, most often when matters of
 security are at issue. The practice of long-term imprisonment
 of political opponents continues. In 1986 such cases
 reportedly exceeded 100, with many more kept under virtually
 constant surveillance by the NSO.
 There were also continuing reports of incommunicado detention,
 many of them relating to cases involving state security.
 However, family and friends are usually able eventually to
 determine a detainee's whereabouts.
 There is no forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are several types of courts in the YAR, including
 traditional Shari'a (Islamic) courts, commercial courts, and
 special security courts. The Shari'a courts have jurisdiction
 in all cases that do not fall into the latter two categories,
 although there is overlapping jurisdiction in some commercial
 law cases. The Shari'a courts appear to be fair and
 impartial, within the context of the Islamic tradition. The
 judge plays an active role in questioning the witnesses,
 seeking to establish the guilt or innocence of the accused.
 Attorneys may counsel their clients, but do not address the
 court or examine witnesses. If the defendant is to be brought
 to trial, he is informed of the charges against him at the
 conclusion of the police investigation.
 There is a possibility of appeal to political authorities
 outside the Shari'a system. Persons often seek to bring the
 
 
 1332
 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 influence of prominent people or government officials to bear
 in a case. The ability to do so varies according to the
 status of the defendant. In a commercial court, litigants can
 generally expect a fair and open trial with legal counsel.
 The Shari'a and commercial courts remain largely independent
 of the executive, though all decisions are subject to review
 and confirmation by the President.
 Those formally charged with espionage or other antigovernment
 activities are tried in special security courts. These courts
 are convened at the direction of the President to. handle
 specific cases. Rights normally afforded the accused may
 be suspended in security cases. All decisions made by the
 security court are subject to review and confirmation by the
 President.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 National security forces operate under an open mandate to
 search homes, monitor telephone conversations, read personal
 mail, or otherwise intrude into private lives when security
 interests are believed involved. Automobiles are routinely
 stopped and searched, and identification is often demanded at
 intersection-checkpoints.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom-of Speech and Press
 Restrictions on free speech exist, but their effect is limited
 to the urban population by the Government's incomplete control
 over the countryside. The Information Ministry controls the
 management and content of radio and television programing, and
 allthe major, widely circulated newspapers. The few privately
 operated, nondaily newspapers remain unable to voice opinions
 different from those of the Government. The Government freely
 removes articles from newspapers and periodicals published in
 the YAR if the censors deem them inappropriate or offensive.
 Publications from outside the country which carry offensive
 articles are withheld from distribution. The Government has
 also suspended publishing rights for extended periods as
 punishment for printing material the censors find
 objectionable. Individual Yemenis believe they may experience
 difficulties if national security officials overhear comments
 critical of the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political parties are illegal. The General People's Congress
 was established by President Salih as a substitute for party
 politics. It is intended to promote regular discussion and
 endorse political activity within the scope of the National
 Charter, the nation's guide to political activity and personal
 rights. As such, it has become the country's only mechanism
 for legitimate popular political expression. At the General
 People's Conference of the Congress in late August 1986,
 President Salih reiterated the prohibition against any other
 form of political activism, declaring in the Conference's
 opening speech that there was no place for partisan politics
 in Yemen.
 Political demonstrations, although ostensibly not illegal, are
 rare, and most of the few that are held are organized by the
 Government. One which was not was a rally in support of the
 
 
 1333
 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 Afghan mujahidin, organized by Islamic conservatives at Sanaa
 University.
 Unions and professional organizations play a minor role in the
 country. Legislation prohibits the establishment of unions
 independent of government control. Strikes are illegal, and
 there is no right of collective bargaining. Shari'a law
 weighs heavily in labor disputes and provides relief for some
 employee grievances.
 Association of Yemeni citizens with foreigners is closely
 monitored by NSO officials. Embassies are required to furnish
 lists of Yemeni guests at all functions, a procedure evidently
 intended to monitor Yemeni contacts with foreigners which also
 discourages fraternization. Invitations for high ranking
 officials must be sent through the Ministry of Foreign
 Affairs. Appointments with Yemenis must be made for most
 employees of foreign embassies through the Foreign Ministry as
 well. Some Yemeni citizens, invited by various embassies to
 social functions, have been denied entry by NSO officials
 waiting outside the embassy. Others have been taken away for
 questioning upon their arrival. Some Yemenis have been
 detained for several hours' interrogation for merely speaking
 with foreign embassy officials or visiting their homes.
 Tribal councils, which formerly provided a forum for relatively
 free expression, are losing their ability to decide local
 affairs as government authority and NSO influence expands into
 the countryside.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the state religion and that of the vast majority of
 Yemenis. Members of the Zaydi (Shi'a) sect have historically
 enjoyed greater political influence than those of the Shafei
 (Sunni) sect, although this distinction has often been as much
 based on geographic and tribal considerations as on sectarian
 grounds. For the most part, the two major Islamic communities
 coexist without friction and seek to minimize the significance
 of doctrinal differences. Muslim associations with ties to
 pan-Islamic or foreign organizations enjoy some degree of
 freedom, including the right to operate schools which are
 largely independent of the national education system.
 Although almost all of the once substantial Yemeni Jewish
 population has emigrated to Israel, a small number of Jews
 remain, perhaps 1,000 or fewer, living mostly in the north of
 the country. There are no synagogues, but Jews are permitted
 to practice their religion in private homes unmolested. The
 Government has made a point of ensuring that no impediments to
 this right exist. Jews usually live in relative harmony with
 their Muslim neighbors. There are no reports of government-
 inspired harassment or intimidation, although violent incidents
 have been reported from time to time. Such incidents, however,
 are not dissimilar to the violence which is a fact of life in
 much of the countryside. Communications between the Yemeni
 Jews and their coreligionists in Israel are strictly
 prohibited.
 There is no indigenous Christian population. Foreign
 Christians are allowed to conduct private services, although
 the establishment of churches is not permitted. Foreign clergy
 are not permitted into the country for missionary purposes;
 however, a few work in social service fields. Public
 celebration of non-Islamic religious holidays is discouraged.
 
 
 1334
 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 Proselytizing is forbidden by law, but Christian missionaries
 have operated hospitals without serious hindrance for many
 years.
 d   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Many-Yemenis historically have sought employment abroad. The
 Government has not restricted this large-scale emigration in
 view of the importance to the economy of foreign remittances.
 Procedures for obtaining passports and compulsory exit permits
 are sometimes onerous, particularly for Yemeni males who have
 not fulfilled their military service obligations. Political
 dissidents have frequently chosen self-imposed foreign exile
 or have accepted government appointments abroad rather than
 face possible difficulties at home stemming from their
 political views. There are no restrictions on travel by
 Yemenis:within the country despite the presence of numerous
 security-heckpoints-on all major roads. Foreign tourists
 must obtain travel permits from-the tourist office, which
 usually issues them with little delay or difficulty. Strict
 controls on the issuance of passports help to regulate travel
 outside-the country.
 The coup in the PDRY in January 1986 resulted in the influx of
 .approximately 15,00.0 to 20:,000 political exiles and refugees
 to the YAR. The. Government has temporarily settled most of
 these.people in refugee camps along the border. Others appear
 to have been taken in by villagers in the area or gone-to stay
 with relatives. There are reportedly 2,500 Eritrean refugees
 and displaced persons living in a camp at Khokha. Political
 activity by both these groups is closely monitored by NSO
 officials and the YAR military. -Most of the Palestinians who
 came to the YAR from Lebanon in 1982-83 are gone. The
 remainder still live. in camps. ThelPalestinians are watched
 closely by-the NSO, which-restricts their movement and
 activity.. There has been no assimilation of the Palestinians
 into Yemeni society, mainly because of the tribal organization
 of the country.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Government does not permit partisan political activity,
 and there is no legal mechanism whereby Yemenis may change
 their- government.. The Presidentmakes all key decisions,
 appoints all government ministers, and controls entry into the
 General People's Congress (GPC), either through direct
 appointments, or through influence over candidacies. The
 Congress has no actual legislative authority, and there is no
 legal opposition. Full-fledged opposition to the Government
 is dealt with as subversion. The people have a limited
 consultative role through the GPC and other channels, and
 criticism and debate of government operations and policies are
 tolerated in the Congress.
 The GPC was first convoked in 1982, ostensibly to formulate
 and ratify the National Charter. It has met twice since that
 time, in 1984 and in August 1986. The President by law
 appointed approximately 40 percent of the membership while the
 others were elected from all parts of the country and included
 men and women from all walks of life.
 Although some latitude existed in the selection of candidates,-
 much of the process was coopted by the Government. It was left
 
 
 1335
 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 to the populace to confirm the Government's selections.
 Control of the Permanent Committee of the Congress, the
 200-person executive element of the Congress, remained
 essentially in the same hands. The Permanent Committee
 consists mostly of government officials, loyal supporters of
 the President, or important personages who would be slighted
 by omission.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no human rights organizations in the YAR, and no
 human rights investigations were conducted in 1986. The
 Government appears unwilling to entertain dialogue from any
 quarter on the subject of human rights, which it regards as an
 internal matter.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Minority groups in the YAR, such as the small Jewish population
 in the north, do not appear to be officially discriminated
 against because of their religion. The Government has tried,
 insofar as its limited authority in rural areas allows, to
 ensure that their rights are not violated. However, because
 of the prevailing tribal structure, tribesmen and members of
 prominent families enjoy an economic advantage over the less
 well-organized, minority elements of society--for example, in
 the sharing of business opportunities. Discrimination in
 favor of family members of tribal kinsmen is a longstanding
 practice.
 A limited number of Yemeni women are employed outside the home
 or farm, in spite of.the YAR-'s conservative Islamic society.
 Some women play an active role in public life, holding
 positions in the Government and the General People's Congress.
 Women now work in .the middle levels of several ministries such
 as the Central Planning Organization, and one woman is in the
 Constituent Assembly. -A few were elected to Local Development
 Councils. The Government does not restrict women's access to
 employment, and women work in banks and other businesses.
 Prevailing social norms-frequently dictate, however, that women
 defer to the guidance of their male colleagues and accept close
 supervision of their activities by male relatives. Women
 seeking exit permits for travel outside the country are
 frequently asked to provide evidence that male relatives pose
 no objection.
 Education for women in significant numbers began only at the
 end of the civil war in 1970. The Government is trying to'
 expand their educational opportunities. However, staffing
 shortages continue to inhibit the opening of new schools and
 the staffing of existing institutions. Traditional Islamic
 norms, more strictly followed in rural areas, as well as the
 considerable time expended by rural women in water and fuel
 collection, limit the ability of women to take advantage of
 educational opportunities.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Workers' rights are defined by Yemeni law, but the regulations
 are virtually unenforceable. Hiring practices favor relatives
 or tribal associates. There is no minimumt wage. Wage
 standards are set by the market. The generally accepted pay
 
 
 1336
 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 scale for unskilled workers is about $10 a day. There is no
 minimum age for employment although there are compulsory
 educational requirements. These regulations are often
 observed more in the breach than in practice.
 Much of the local production is based on agrarian or "cottage
 type" industry in which children often work. The presence of
 children in the workplace is more a reflection of family
 values and expectations.than an exploitation of available
 labor. Children, especially outside urban centers,
 traditionally learn their trade or occupation from their
 parents rather than from formal educational experiences.
 While working conditions are sometimes harsh, reflecting the
 subsistence economy which generally prevails, the Government
 has set general safety requirements and occasionally inspects
 to ensure that industrial producers have established safety
 standards for their employees. Although not strictly enforced,
 these safety standards are generally observed for reasons of
 efficiency.
