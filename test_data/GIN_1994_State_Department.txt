 GUINEA
 The Government controlled the election of President Lansana Conte from start to
 finish and deni'ed the oppsto any significant role. Complete management of the
 elections rested with the Ministry of Interior and Security. The Government insisted
 on holding the elections, notwithstanding considerable pressure for postpnement
 from the political opposition, outside observers, and religious leaders. The National
 Electoral Commission, which began functioning only a few days before the elections,
 called for a postponement and refused to participate in the verification of results.
 Opposition p    observers, who were excluded from the final hours of vote-count-
 ng,_coested    e fina results. In January the Supreme Court ejected oposition
 legal challenges to the vote count and ruled that Lansana Conte had won  e elec-
 tionon the first round with 51.7 percent of the vote.
 The Gendarmerie and the National Police share responsibility for internal secu-
 rity. The Government eliminated the Republican and Presidential Guards and incor-
 porated these units into other existing units. Both military personnel and police con-
 tinue to commit human rights abuses.
 Eighty percent of the population of 7 million engage in subsistence agriculture,
 and annual per capita gross domestic product is about $511. Guinea's major exports
 
 
 are bauxite, gold, and diamonds. The World Bank and the International Monetary
 Fund continued to contribute to Guinea's economic restructuring program. This led,
 among other things, to a sharp reduction in the size of the public service.
 Human rights remain circumscribed. The Government dominated the electoral
 process and rejected opposition demands for important changes. An independent
 press occasionally criticized the Government, but the latter owns and operates the
 electronic media, the major medium for reaching the vast majority of the public.
 There were sporadic outbreaks of ethnically based violence and recourse to vigi-
 lante justice, prompted in part by increased violent criminal activity. Major human
 rights abuses included extrajudicial killings by security forces; police abuse of pris-
 oners and detainees; governmental failure to guarantee access by attorneys to cli-
 ents in prison, where much abuse takes place with impunity; the Executive Branch's
 influence over the judicial system; the Government's continued neglect of the prison
 system; its domination of the electronic media, thus denying the political opposition
 the means to reach the populace; its denial of citizens' rights to change the govern-
 ment and its inability to prevent vigilante justice; and violence and discrimination
 against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of targeted
 political killings, but there were several extrajudicial killings by security forces
 using excessive force.
 In March military recruits in Labe rioted following an altercation in a bar in
 which a soldier nearly beat a civilian to death. After family and friends of the civil-
 ian seized and flogged to death a military officer who had not been involved in the
 prior altercation, armed military recruits ransacked the neighborhood of the bar,
 wounding many people. During the riot an elderly woman died of a gunshot wound.
 On August 31, security forces in Kerouane used tear gas and fired shots in the
 air to disperse a crowd at a political opposition rally. Two independent newspapers
 reported that two individuals died. Ministry of Justice officials reported that an in-
 vestigation would take place, although no results were reported by year's end.
 Concerning the August 1993 death in police custody of Alseny Limam Kourouma,
 police reportedly tried to cover up the incident by forcing a doctor to issue a false
 death certificate listing heart failure as the cause of death. The authorities sus-
 pended and detained the officer in charge of the station where the torture had re-
 portedly occurred. Authorities arrested and detained two officers who are still await-
 ing tria.
 . Disappearance.-There were no reports of abductions or disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Penal Code and the Constitution prohibit torture and cruel, inhuman, and de-
 grading treatment. However, the police often use beatings to extract confessions and
 also employ other forms of brutality. u
 In February the police summarily punished a number of taxi drivers for illegally
 stopping or parking at the roadside. The drivers received lashes across their but-
 tocks while they were made to spread themselves over the hoods of their cars. A
 few drivers reportedly required medical treatment due to the severity of the lash-
 in   September 11 in N'Zerekore, local police harassed and then detained at their
 station an American citizen as she returned home that evening. After leaving the
 station, an army soldier assaulted her and attempted to rape her. Local, regional,
 and national authorities cooperated in identifying the assailant. In November, he
 was dismissed from the army, sentenced to 6 months in prison with hard labor, and
 fined $220.
 On November 26, soldiers in Conakry detained approximately 40 civilians at
 Camp Almamy Samory. The detainees, mainly Guineans and Lebanese, were beaten
 and held without charges for over 5 hours. Soldiers allegedly raped some of the
 women in the group.
 Prison conditions, including those in the women's prison, are inhumane and life-
 threatening. The standards of sanitation and nutrition remain poor. Deaths due to
 malnutrition and disease are frequent. The Government does not permit local
 human rights organizations to visit prisons. On the night of December 31, sixteen
 prisoners died in Conakry's Central Prison. The State Prosecutor began an inves-
 tigation.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Penal Code requires that detainees
 must be charged before a magistrate within 72 hours. Once charged, the accused
 may be held until the final outcome of the case, including during the period of any
 
 
 107
 appeals. Release on bail is at the discretion of the magistrate who has jurisdiction
 in the case. The Constitution proscribes incommunicado detention. The law guaran-
 tees attorneys access to their clients, but authorities frequently do not respect this
 provision.
 In practice, administrative controls over the police are ineffective, and security
 forces rarely follow the Penal Code; arbitrary arrest remained a persistent threat
 to Guineans.
 On January 21 in Kankan, security forces stopped, beat, and imprisoned an opo-
 sition party delegation touring the region. Locl olice subsequently released the
 members of the delegation. In June gendarmes etained two soldiers to answer
 questions concerning their alleged disloyalty and malfeasance. After 2 days, they
 were released.
 At year's end, there were no known political or security detainees being held by
 the Government.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial-The Constitution affirms the judiciary's independ-
 ence. Magistrates, however, are civil servants having no guarantee of tenure and
 are susceptible to influence by the executive branch. Judicial authorities often defer
 to central authorities in politically sensitive cases. In addition, the administration
 of justice is plagued by numerous other problems, including a shortae of mag-
 istrates (who generally are poorly trained) and lawyers (there are 48 m all), and
 an outdated and overly restrictive Penal Code. Owing to corruption and nepotism
 in the judiciary, relatives of influential members of the Government are virtually
 above the law.
 The Penal Code provides for the presumption of innocence of accused persons, the
 independence of judges, the equality of citizens before the law, the right of the ac-
 cused to counsel, and the right to  peal a judicial decision. Although in principle
 the Government is responsible for   nding legal defense costs in serious criminal
 cases, in practice it rarely disburses these funds. The attorney for the defense fre-
 quently receives no payent.
 The judiciary includes courts of first instance, two Courts of Appeal and the Su-
 preme Court, the court of final appeal. There is also a State Security Court, but it
 has no me since the trial of those allegedly involved in the coup attempt of 1985.
 A milire    tribunal prep ares  adjudicates charges against accused  mlit   per-
 sonnel. Since 1988, civilian courts have rendered all judgents regarding violatins
 under the Penal Code.
 A traditional system of justice exists at the village or urban neighborhood level.
 Litigants present their civil cases before a village chief, a neighborhood chief, or a
 ouncil of wise men. The dividing ine between the formal and informal justice sys-
 tems is vague, and a case may be referred from the formal to the traditional system
 to ensure compliance by all parties with the judicial ruling. Conversely, if a case
 _cannot be resolved to the satisfaction of all parties in the traditional system, it may
 be referred to the formal system for adjudication.
 Suspected criminals, notably thieves, are sometimes beaten to death by their vic-
 tims, and by others with tacit approval of police authorities.
 Guinea did not have any known politia prisoners at year's end.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or orresporndnce.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home and judicial search warrants
 are required bylaw. Police frequently ignore these procedures, however, or do not
 strictly follow them, and interference in citizens' lives continued, primarily through
 Arpolice harlassment. Police and paramilitary police of ten innore legal procedues in
 te pursir o criminas and irequently etai private citzens at night read oc s
 in order to extort money to supplement their incomes. It is widely believed that se-
 curity officials monitor mail and telephone calls.
 Loal businesses, especially expatriate ompanies, often complain of intimidation
 and harassment by public officials and authorties.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Pres a-The Government has stated publicly that it sup-
 ports free speech and a free press, and the Constitution provides for freedom of ex-
 pression, subject to certain limitations. But while proclaiming freedom of the press
 and communications, the Press Law gives the Government a sufficiently broad
 rang of possible restrictive actions as to vitiate any real prtecton It also prohibits
 seditious talk or chants uttered in public, establishes defamation and slander as
 criminal offenses, and prohibits communications that offend the President, incite vi-
 olence, discrimination, hatred, or disturb the public peace.
 The Government owns and operates the electronic news media, with national and
 rual radio being the most important outet in reaching the public. It also publishes
 the official newspaper, Horeya. Reporters for the official press, who are government
 
 
 108
 employees, practice self-censorship in order to protect their jobs. The Ministry of
 Communications continues to act as overseer of state-owned media.
 There is a vocal and active independent and opposition press, which is on occasion
 critical of the President and the Government. The two weekly newspapers, Le Lynx
 and L'Independant, and up to two dozen other publications continue to publish de-
 spite technical and financial difficulties. Some newspapers are linked to opposition
 parties while others offer news and criticism of both the Government and the oppo-
 sition.
 Political tracts circulate widely throughout Conakry and other regions, and in-
 clude specific criticisms of the President and high officials. Foreign publications,
 some of which include criticism of the Government, are usually available.
 There were no known attempts to interfere with foreign radio broadcasts. On
 March 9 the Government shut down the country's first and only independent radio
 station, Radio Gandal. It had begun, without a license, to broadcast music on March
 3.
 The Ministry of Higher Education exercises control over academic freedom
 through its influence on the faculty hiring and control over curriculum. In general,
 teachers are not subject to classroom censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of association is pro-
 tected by law, but there are legal restrictions on assembly. The Penal Code bans
 any meeting that has an ethnic or racial character or any gathering "whose nature
 threatens national unity." A September 1992 statute allows public gatherings only
 with 72-hour prior notification to the Government. Following intercommunal riots
 in September 1993, the Government banned all street marches except for funerals.
 Pursuant to this statute, local administrative authorities may cancel a demonstra-
 tion or meeting if they have grounds to believe that public order will be threatened.
 They may hold event organizers criminally liable if violence or destruction of prop-
 erty ensues. Organizers of political rallies in the opposition stronghold region of
 Upper Guinea have been arrested for violating this statute.
 Political parties must provide information on their founding members and produce
 internal statutes and political platforms consistent with the Constitution before the
 Government recognizes them. At year's end, there were 46 legally recognized politi-
 cal parties.
 On September 8, local officials and security forces in Faranah attempted to detain
 Alpha Conde, Secretary General of the Malinke-based political party, the Rally of
 the Guinean People (RPG). Government officials stated that local officials wanted
 only to talk to Alpha Conde and that they had made no attempt to detain him.
 Conde intended to hold a political rally, but authorities prevented him from entering
 the city. The Ministry of Interior subsequently canceled the remaining portion of
 Conde's tour of Upper Guinea, where his party had enjoyed its greatest electoral
 success.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution declares Guinea to be a secular state,
 and religious groups freely practice their faiths. Foreign missionaries, both Catholic
 and Protestant, operate freely.
 The Government and the quasi-governmental National Islamic League have spo-
 ken out against the proliferation of Shi'ite fundamentalist sects "generating confu-
 sion and deviation" (within Guinean Islam) but have not restricted these groups.
 The Constitution provides religious communities the freedom to govern themselves
 without state interference.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for the right of Guineans to travel freely
 within the country and to change their places of residence and work. The Govern-
 ment requires all citizens to carry national identification cards which they must
 present on demand at security checkpoints. Travelers in large cities face harassment
 by police and at military roadblocks,.particularly late at night. It is common for citi-
 zens to pay bribes to avoid police harassment. The Government permits foreign
 travel, although it retains the ability to limit it for political reasons. For example,
 in February airport security officers prevented Siradiou Diallo, Secretary General of
 the Party for Renewal and Progress, from boarding a plane to Senegal. Several
 hours later, officials allowed him to depart.
 In June the Government ordered the removal of checkpoints at prefectoral bor-
 ders. In November authorities instituted midnight to daybreak roadblocks through-
 out the city of Conakry in order to control increasing banditry. Security agents were
 instructed to detain only those lacking proper documentation. However, some secu-
 rity agents, and in particular soldiers, harassed, detained, and beat those who did
 not pay bribes.
 Guinea currently hosts approximately 633,200 Liberian and Sierra Leonean refu-
 gees. The Government continues to work closely with the United Nations High Coin-
 
 
 109
 missioner for Refugees and many other international and nongovernmental organi-
 zations to provide food and shelter to those designated as refugees. While the Gov-
 ernment has generally been hospitable toward refugees, there have been reports of
 local police officials and border patrol soldiers demanding bribes or sexual favors for
 entry into Guinea. There were no reports of forced repatriation.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change their Govern-
 ment
 Although multiparty elections were held in 1993, the Government dominated the
 electoral process (even excluding opposition observers from the final vote count) thus
 calling into serious doubt the ability of the people effectively to exercise their con-
 stitutional right to change the government.
 Following the installation of Lansana Conte as President on January 29, the Gov-
 ernment took steps to inhibit opposition political activity. The RPG coordinated a
 tax boycott in its stronghold, Uppr Guinea. This ended in May, owing to oppressive
 tactics of the Government, including detention without charge of RPG militants, ar-
 rests for organizing rallies and disrupting RPG political rallies.
 The President's party, tie Party of Unity anI Progress (PUP), remained the pre-
 eminent political organization. PUP's strength rested on the fragmentation of the
 opposition.
 While women are numerically underrepresented in the Government, they partici-
 pated overwhelmingly in the presidential election. President Conte named four
 women to ministerial positions, including the Minister of Agriculture.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Loca nongovernmental organizations primarily interested in human rights issues
 include: the Guinean Organization for the Defense of Human Rights (OGDH); the
 Guinean Human Rights Association (AGDH); the Children of the Victims of damp
 Boiro; the Association of Victims of Repression (AVR); and the Committee for the
 Defense of Civic Rights. These groups, especially OGDH, AGDH and AVR, were
 vocal in calling attention to human rights auses.
 The government-controlled press denounces efforts by foreign governments or or-
 ganizations to interfere in internal affairs, including the protection of human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that all persons are equal before the law, regardless of
 gender, race, ethnicity, language, beliefs, political opinions, philosophy, or creed.
 Women.-Although the Constitution provides for equal treatment of men and
 women, women face discrimination, particularly in rural areas, where opportunities
 for women are limited by custom and the demands of child-rearing and arduous sub-
 sistence farming. Women are not denied access to land, credit or businesses. The
 Government has affirmed the principle of equal pay for equal work, but in practice
 women receive less pay than men in most equally demanding jobs. According to a
 1991 United Nations Development Program report, females receive only 20 percent
 as much schooling as males.
 Violence against women, including wife beating, is common, although social work-
 ers' estimates differ as to the extent of the problem. Wife beating is a criminal of-
 fense and constitutes grounds for divorce under civil law; however, police rarely in-
 tervene in domestic disputes. Although the Government has made regular state-
 ments in the media against sexual harassment, women working in the small formal
 sector in urban areas complain of frequent sexual harassment. Refugees from Libe-
 ria and Sierra Leone reported some Guinean soldiers demanded sex in exchange for
 entry into Guinea. Although not considered widespread, the social stigma attached
 to rape prevents most women from reporting it. The Government has not vigorously
 pursued criminal investigations of alleged sexual crimes.
 Children.-The Constitution provides that the Government has a particular obli-
 gation to protect and nurture the nation's youth, and it allocates a significant per-
 centage of its budget to primary education.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which international health experts have con-
 demned as damaging to both physical and mental health, is performed at an early
 age and is practiced among Muslims and animists. According to an independent ex-
 pert, about 60 percent of females have undergone this procedure.
 Grandmothers frequently insist on the circumcision of a granddaughter, even
 when the parents are opposed. Infibulation, the most dangerous form of FGM, is not
 practiced. The Government has made efforts to educate health workers on the dan-
 gers of this procedure and supports the World Health Organization resolutions call-
 ing for its elimination.
 
 
 110
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-While the Constitution and the Penal Code
 prohibit racial or ethnic discrimination, ethnic identification is strong. Mutual sus-
 picion affects relations across ethnic lines in and out of government. The Cabinet
 includes representatives of all major ethnc groups, but a disproportionate number
 of senior military officers are Soussou, the ethnic group of President Conte.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution provides that all persons are equal be-
 fore the law. There are no special constitutional provisions for the disabled. The
 Government has not mandated accessibility for the -disabled and few disabled people
 work.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of employees
 to form labor unions and protects them from discrimination based on their union
 affiliations. Only an estimated 5 percent of the work force is unionized. Most union
 members are government employees, employees of the national utilities (electric,
 water, and telephone companies) or of foreign-controlled companies.
 The Labor   ode states that all workers (except military and paramilitary) have
 he right to create and participate in organizations that defend and develop their
 individual and collective rights as workers. It requires elected worker representa-
 tives for any enterprise employing 25 or more salaried workers.
 The National Confederation of Guinean Workers (CNTG) was the sole trade union
 before the Labor Code was enacted. Even though therere e now other trade union
 and labor confederations, the CNTG remains the largest confederation.
 The CNTG is indirectly funded by the State, although dissident members seek to
 increase the Confederation's freedom from Government control. Independent unions
 and confederations have gained popularity, such as the Free Union of Teachers and
 Researchers of Guinea and the National Organization for Free Trade Unions of
 Guinea. Several disgruntled groups within the CNTG left the Confederation, citing
 corruption in the leadership.These groups joined with some independent unions to
 form a new confederation, the United Syndicates of Guinean Workers.
 The Labor Code grants salaried workers, including public sector civilian employ-
 ees, the right to strike 10 days after their representative union makes known its
 intention to do so. It prohibits strikes in sectors providing essential services (hos-
 pitals, radio and television, army, and police). Workers, incl-uding Conakry bank em-
 ployees, transport workers, anduniversity teachers, particular the  edical Fac-
 ulty, again exercised their right to strike.
 Unions may freely affiliate with international labor groups. The Government con-
 tinued to designate CNTG to represent workers in the International Labor Organi-
 zation Conference in 1994.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Under the Labor Code, rep-
 resentative workers' unions or union groups may organize the workplace and nego-
 tiate with employers or employer organizations. The law protects the right to bar-
 gain collectively concerning wages and salaries without government interference.
 Wor rules andwork hours established by the employer are to be developed in con-
 sultation with union delegates. The Code also prohibits antinion discrimination.
 Union delegates represent individual and collective claims and grievances with man-
 agement. Individual workers threatened with dismissal or other sanctions have the
 right to a hearing before management with a union refresentative present and, if
 necessary, to take the ca int tte  Con y Labor Curt which convenes weey
 to hear sucn cases. In the interior, civil courts hear labor cases.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code specifically for-
 bides forced or ompulsory labor, and there is no evidence of its practice.
 d. Mininum Age for Employment t   Children.-The minium age for employment
 according to the Labor ee   is   1years. Apprentices, however, may start at 14
 yeears. Workers and apprentices under the age of 18 are not permitted to work at
 night nor for more than 12 consecutive hours, nor on Sundays. The Labor Code also
 stipulates that the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs maintain a list of occupa-
 tions in which women and youth under 18 cannot be employed. In practice, enforce-
 ment by Ministry inspectors is limited to large firms in the modern sector of the
 economy. Children of all ages work on family farms, in small trades, and in the in-
 formal sector, such as in street vending.
 e. Acceptable Conditions                  . Work.- The Labor Cold provides for the establishment
 by decree of a guaranteed minimum hourly wage, but the Government has not yet
 done so. There are also provisions in the C or overtime and night wages, which
 are fixed percentages of the regalar wage. According to the Labor Cod, regular
 work is not to exceed 10-hour days or 48-hour weeks, with a 40-hour workweek
 being the norm, and there is to be a period of at least 24 consecutive hours of rest
 
 
 each week, usually Sunday. Every salaried worker has the legal right to an annual
 paid vacation, accumulated at the rate of at least 2.5 workdays per month of work.
 In practice, authorities enforce these rules only in the relatively small modern
 urban sector.
 The Labor Code contains previsions of a general nature respecting occupational
 safety and health, but the Government has at year's end not yet elaborated a set
 of practicable workplace health and safety standards. Neither had it issued any of
 the ministerial orders laying out the specific requirements for certain occupations
 and for certain methods of work that are called for in the Labor Code. The Ministry
 of Labor and Social Affairs is responsible for enforcing labor standards, and its in-
 spectors are empowered to suspend work immediately in situations hazardous to
 health. Enforcement, however, remained more of a goa than a reality. Labor inspec-
 tors acknowledge that they cannot even cover Conakry, much less the entire coun-
 try, with their small staff and meager budget.
