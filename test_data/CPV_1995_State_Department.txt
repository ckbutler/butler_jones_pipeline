 CAPE VERDE
 Cape Verde is a parliamentary democracy in which constitutional powers are
 shared between President Antonio Mascarenhas Monteiro, an independent, and
 Prime Minister Carlos Wahnon de Carvalho Veiga, and his party, the Movement for
 Democracy (MPD). The MPD dominates the National Assembly in which only two
 of the four official political parties are represented.
 The Government controls the police, which have primary responsibility for main-
 tenance of law and order. There were no reported human rights abuses committed
 by security forces.
 Cape Verde has a market-based economy but little industry and few exploitable
 natural resources. The country has a long history of economically driven emigration,
 primarily to Western Europe and the United States, and receipts from Cape
 Verdeans abroad remain an important source of national income. Even in years of
 optimum rainfall, the country can produce food for only 25 percent of the population,
 resulting in heavy reliance on international food aid.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law
 and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with instances of individual abuse.
 
 
 However, societal discrimination and in particular domestic violence and discrimina-
 tion against women continued to be serious problems. The mistreatment of children
 remained a serious problem, exacerbated by a poor economic situation which placed
 stress on large families in securing food, water, and other necessities. Although the
 Government supported legislation to ameliorate these problems, it failed to adopt,
 implement, and enforce policies designed to address the most critical challenges.
 There were instances of media self-censorship.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials
 employed them.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law stipulates that authorities bring
 charges before a judge within 24 hours of arrest. Police may not make arrests with-
 out a court order unless a person is caught in the act of committing a felony. In
 exceptional cases, and with the concurrence of a court official, authorities may de-
 tain persons without charge for up to 5 days. These laws are observed in practice.
 The Ministry of Justice has 40 days to prepare for trial in state security cases,
 and may detain persons until trial or for a period not to exceed 1 year. There is
 a functioning system of bail.
 There were no reports of security detentions or forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial-The Constitution provides for the right to a fair
 trial. A judiciary independent of the executive branch generally provides due process
 rights, but there are serious delays owing to understaffing.
 The judicial system is composed of the Supreme Court and the regional courts.
 There are five Supreme Court judges, including one appointed by the President, one
 appointed by the National Assembly, and three appointed by the High Council of
 Magistrates. Judges are independent and may not belong to a political party.
 Defendants are presumed to be innocent; have the right to public, nonjury trial;
 to counsel; to present witnesses; and to appeal verdicts. Free counsel is provided for
 the indigent. Regional courts adjudicate minor disputes on the local level in rural
 areas. The Ministry of Justice and Labor appoints local judges, who are usually
 prominent local citizens. Defendants may appeal regional court decisions to the Su-
 preme Court.
 The right to an expeditious trial is constrained by a seriously overburdened judi-
 cial system. A backlog of cases routinely leads to trial delays of 6 months.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, and government authorities respect these pro-
 hibitions in practice.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom to ex-
 press ideas by words, images, or any other means, and for freedom of the press
 without censorship. The Government generally respected these freedoms in practice.
 Nevertheless, there was increased criticism by independent political figures of the
 performance of the state-controlled television, radio, and print media for their fail-
 ure to exercise vigorously their monitoring role in a multiparty system.
 Journalists are independent of the Government and are not required to reveal
 their sources. However, self-censorship within government-controlled media, includ-
 ing the national television and radio networks as well as the state-owned newspaper
 Novo Jornal, influences media criticism of the Government. Journalists in govern-
 ment enterprises have also been demoted or dismissed allegedly for exceeding the
 bounds of accepted criticism. In the case of opposition media, particularly news-
 papers, government officials have sought to use the country's strict libel laws to at-
 tack critics for perceived unjustified criticism.
 Independent journalists and their newspapers were, however, successful in the
 courts in defending their actions. In one case, a court rejected the accusations of an
 influential government minister against the newspaper of the major opposition polit-
 ical party. In a second legal proceeding involving an ex-director of the same news-
 paper, the individual was exonerated of two criminal complaints and found guilty
 of one charge. The case is under appeal. In two other cases challenging dismissals
 from employment with state-owned media companies, journalists were successful in
 
 
 gaining compensation against the national radio network and the predecessor to the
 government-controlled newspaper. Finally, the former president of the association of
 journalists instituted legal action to overturn his dismissal from his position. Sev-
 eral important cases are pending which, upon resolution, will have a significant im-
 pact on press freedom.
 Government authorization is not needed to establish newspapers, other printed
 publications, or electronic media. Independent media outlets experienced no direct
 pressure in their daily operations or business activities. For example, the Catholic
 radio station signed an agreement with the British Broadcasting Corporation to
 broadcast its Portuguese language newscast. The national radio station broadcasts
 live National Assembly sessions and was harshly criticized for announcing that it
 was considering reducing such coverage. Independent newspapers and electronic
 media, aside from the examples cited above, strongly and consistently criticize gov-
 ernment policies and officials.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association without authorization and without
 harassment by the authorities. Throughout the year, labor organizations, opposition
 political parties, civic action groups, and numerous others exercised this right with-
 out government interference or objection. Opposition political parties routinely ig-
 nored the legal requirement that officials be advised before the holding of dem-
 onstrations and experienced no retaliatory or punitive measures from the Govern-
 ment.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for the freedom of religion and
 the separation of church and state. It also prohibits the State from imposing reli-
 gious beliefs and practices. The Government respects these rights in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides citizens with the right to travel and establish resi-
 dence without government restrictions. The Constitution provides for repatriation,
 and the Government respects this in practice.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised this right in 1991, after 15 years of one-party rule. An opposi-
 tion party won the country's first free legislative and presidential elections and
 peacefully assumed power. Promulgation of the new Constitution in 1992 consoli-
 dated this change.
 The critical second round of multiparty elections for the National Assembly was
 held in December, resulting in a resounding victory for the governing MPD party
 of Prime Minister Veiga. Municipal and presidential elections were scheduled for
 January and February 1996, respectively. With its margin in victory the MPD could
 govern virtually without the need to consult the two opposition parties represented
 in the Assembly, should it elect to do so. Observers saw the election results as a
 further repudiation of the discredited one-party government set up after independ-
 ence from Portugal in 1975, which had clung to power until the first free, fair elec-
 tions in 1991.
 The Constitution provides for separation of powers. Cabinet ministers are not re-
 quired to be members of the National Assembly, but they are individually subject
 to parliamentary confirmation. Collectively, they must retain the support of a par-
 liamentary majority. The President may dismiss the Government with the approval
 of the Council of the Republic, which is composed of the president of the National
 Assembly, the Prime Minister, the president of the Supreme Court, the Attorney
 General, the President of the Regional Affairs Council, and four private members.
 Referendums may be held under specified circumstances but may not challenge indi-
 vidual political rights and liberties or the right of opposition parties to exist and
 function freely.
 There are no restrictions in law or practice regarding the rights of women or mi-
 norities to vote or to participate in the political process. Women comprise 7.6 per-
 cent of the deputies elected to the National Assembly. The two female ministers in
 the Cabinet of the Prime Minister represent 13 percent of the ministerial positions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are two private human rights groups in Cape Verde--the National Commis-
 sion of the Rights of Man and the Cape erdean League for Human Rights. No
 major human rights organizations cn   tioncedinesiga tns in Cape Verde during
 the year.
 
 
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability
 language, or social status. However, the Government does not effectively enforce all
 its provisions, resulting in ongoing discrimination, particularly against women and
 children.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women, including wife beating, remains com-
 mon, particularly in rural areas. Victims rarely report crimes such as rape and
 spousal abuse to the police. Neither the Government nor women's organizations
 have addressed directly the issue of violence against women.
 Women continue to face discrimination in several ways. Despite constitutional
 prohibitions against sex discrimination and provisions for full equality, including
 equal pay for equal work, discrimination continues. Women experience difficulties
 in obtaining certain types of employment. Although they are often paid less than
 men, they are making modest inroads in the professions.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination against women in inheritance, family,
 and custody matters. However, largely because of illiteracy, most women are un-
 aware of their rights. Women are often reluctant to seek redress of domestic dis-
 putes in the courts. The Organization of Cape Verdean Women alleges disparate
 treatment in inheritance matters despite laws calling for equal rights.
 Women comprise 52.7 percent of the general population, but only 36.8 percent of
 the employed work force. Among those considered unemployed within the labor pool
 actively seeking employment, government figures indicate that women make up 54.7
 percent of those out of compensated employment. Despite these dire statistics, em-
 ployment opportunities for women are improving, as evidenced by the increasing
 presence of women in the upper echelons of government and among the legal and
 medical professions.
 With the impetus gained from the preparatory work for the United Nations
 Fourth World Conference on Women, women's organizations launched new efforts
 to improve the plight of poor and economically disadvantaged women, holding sev-
 eral symposiums and conferences. They demanded new laws protecting women
 against violence and abuse and the enforcement of constitutional provisions estab-
 lishing equal rights. In March a group of women incorporated the Cape Verdean As-
 sociation for the Protection of the Family, whose stated goals were the promotion
 of the rights of the family, protection of the mother and child, women's health care
 (including the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases), and the promotion of
 family planning. According to women's groups, large, unplanned families represent
 the main cause of poverty and lack of job opportunity for women.
 Children.--Child abuse is a continuing problem. Although the Government may
 remove children from abusive parents and place them in orphanages, it seldom took
 such actions. The Government maintained its effort to highlight the costs to society
 of such mistreatment and to promote the legal protection of abused minors. The gov-
 ernment-controlled newspaper published a multipage expose on the plight of aban-
 doned children left to roam the streets, noting that such situations lead to violent
 abuse of children, crime, and prostitution. Local experts, mental health profes-
 sionals, and social workers have called on government officials and the larger popu-
 lation to reject an indifferent attitude and strive to reduce and eliminate the prob-
 lem. In conjunction with the United Nations Children's Fund, the Cae Verdean In-
 stitute for Minors published the book "Legal Protection of Children as a working
 document for government officials and others, setting out the laws and rights per-
 taining to the protection of minors and the social and governmental institutions
 with responsibility for enforcing those rights.
 As a result of the devastating effects of the cholera epidemic, the Government fo-
 cused more attention on preventive treatment, especially regarding the health care
 of children. It instituted a broad based immunization campaign for young children.
 Throughout the year the official media broadcast and diffused public service mes-
 sages imploring mothers to seek prenatal care for their babies.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not mandate access to public
 buildings or services for the disabled. It does provide transportation (a combination
 wheelchair and three-wheel motor scooter) for handicapped persons. Physically dis-
 abled persons are not subject to discrimination in employment or education.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers are legally free to form and to join unions
 without government authorization or restriction. There are two umbrella union as-
 sociations: the Council of Free Labor Unions, formed after the change in government
 and composed of 11 unions with about 7,000 members, and the National Union of
 Cape Verde Workers, formed by the former ruling party but operating independ-
 
 
 45
 ently, composed of 13 unions with about 15,000 members. The Government does not
 interfere with the activities of these organizations, but both suffer from a shortage
 of funds.
 The Constitution provides union members with the right to strike, and the Gov-
 ernment respects this right. By law, an employer must reinstate a worker fired un-
 justly.
 Unions are free to affiliate internationally and have ties with African and inter-
 national trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to organize and operate without hindrance and to sign collective work con-
 tracts. Workers and management in the small private sector, as well as in the pub-
 lic sector, reach agreement through collective bargaining. As the country's largest
 employer, the Government continues to play the dominant role by setting wages in
 the civil service. It does not fix wages for the private sector, but salary levels for
 civil servants provide the basis for wage negotiations in theprivate sector.
 A 1991 legislative decree bans antiunion discrimination by employers, with fres
 for offenders. There were no reported cases of such discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is forbidden by law
 and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ploymentis 14 years. The law prohibits children under the age 16 from working at
 night, more than 7 hours per day, or in establishments where toxic products are
 rdced, but the Government rarely enforces the law. In practice, the Ministry of
 Justice and Labor enforces minimum age laws with limited success, and only in the
 urban, formal sectors of the economy.
 e._Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There are no established minimum wage rates
 in the private sector. Large urban private employers link their minimum wages to
 those paid to civil servants, which for an entry level worker is $180 (15,000 escudos)
 per month. The majority of jobs pay wages insufficient to provide a worker and fam-
 ily a decent standard of living;, therefore, most workers also rely on second jobs, ex-
 tended family help, and subsistence agriculture.
 The maximum legal workweek for adults is 44 hours. While large employers gen-
 erally respect these regulations, many domestic servants and rural workers work
 longer hours.
 The Director General of Labor conducts periodic inspections to enforce proper
 labor practices and imposes fines on private enterprises which are not in conformity
 with the law. However, the Government does not systematically enforce labor laws
 and much of the labor force does not enjoy their protection. There are few industries
 that employ heavy or dangerous equipment, and work-related accidents are rare.
