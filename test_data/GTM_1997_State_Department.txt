 GUATEMALA
 Guatemala is a democratic republic with separation of government powers and a
 centralized national administration. The 1985 Constitution provides for election by
 universal suffrage of a one-term president and a unicameral congress. It also man-
 dates a Human Rights Ombudsman (PDH), who is elected by and reports to the
 Congress. In the November 1995 elections for president, vice president, congress,
 and municipal offices, the National Advancement Party (PAN) won 42 of the 80 con-
 gressional seats; however, no presidential candidate received an absolute majority
 
 
 527
 of the votes. Alvaro Arzu Irigayen of the PAN won-the runoff presidential election
 and took office in January 1996. Reflecting a greater opening for political activity
 24 parties, including a broad front coalition composed of civic, human rights, and
 labor leaders, campaigned in the free and fair elections. The judiciary is independ-
 ent, but suffers from inefficiency and corruption.
 The Arzu administration ended 36 years of internal conflict by signing a com-
 p rehensive peace agreement with the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity
 (URNG) guerrillas on December 29, 1996. Tmplementation of the Peace Accords
 egan almost immediately: Demobilization of the URNG guerrillas was completed
 mnMay, the Mobile Military Police (PMA) were disbanded ahead of schedule, and
 the Government reduced the size of the military forces. As called for in the accords,
 the Government proposed and Congress enacted a wide-raning series of legal re-
 forms to prtect human rights, strengthen civilian control of the military, address
 discrimination agist the indigenous population, and lay the groundwork for fur-
 ther political and socioeconomic reforms. In the wake of the final Peace Accords, the
 mandate of the U.N. Human Rights Verification Mission (MINUGUA), established
 in November 1994 to monitor compliance with the Government-URNG human rights
 accord, was expanded to include peace implementation issues. The December 1996
 National Reconciliation Law, which provided amnesty for some acts related to the
 internal conflict, has been narrowly interpreted by the courts and its constitutional-
 ity was upheld on October 8.
 The Minister of Government oversees the National Civilian Police (PNC) created
 in January under the terms of the Peace Accords, which has sole responsibility for
 internal security. There are no active members of the military in the police com-
 mand structure, but President Arzu ordered the army to support the plice in re-
 sponse to public concern about a nationwide wave of violent crime. The Presidential
 Military Staff (EMP) continued to exercise a law-enforcement role. Some members
 of the police and security forces committed human rights violations.
 The agricultural-based, private sector-oriented economy grew by approximately
 5.0 percent in real terms. Coffee, sugar, andbananas are the leading exports, and
 more than half the work force is engaged in agriculture. Inflation was about 9 per-
 cent in 1996. There is a marked disparity in income distribution, and poverty is per-
 vasive, particularly in the large indigenous ommunity. According to U.N. statistics,
 approximately 80 percent of the citizens live in poverty, with 59 percent in extreme
 pverty. Per capita gross national product was approximately $1,450 in 1996.
 The significant improvement in the overall human rights situation under the Arzu
 administration continued. In contrast to past years, there was a marked decline in
 new cases of human rights abuses, but problems remain in some areas. Positive po-
 litical developments and the reduction of the size of the security forces, stemming
 from success ful implementation of the Peace Accords, were major factors in these
 changes. Nevertheless, members of the security forces were implicated in some
 extrajudicial killings and mistreated suspects and detainees. MINUGUA and other
 human rights monitors accused the EMP of serious human rights abuses, including
 at least one forced disappearance. Prison conditions remain harsh. Arbitrary arrest
 and detention, and lengthy pretrial detention, remain problems. Efforts to reform
 the police and judiciary continued in an attempt to -eliminate the climate of impu-
 nity, and the Government initiated some prosecutions of human rights abusers. The
 failure to resolve past serious human rights abuses remains a major problem. With
 judges and other law enforcement officials subject to intimidation and corruption,
 the inefficient judicial system is often unable to ensure fair trials and due process.
 Elements of the security forces infringed on citizens' privacy rights. Discrimination
 and violence against women persisted, as did societal abuse of children and discrimi-
 nation against the disabled and indigenous people. Lynchings and mob attacks con-
 tinued, and the Government was unable to prosecute the perpetrators.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were isolated allegations of
 politically motivated killings during the year; however, none of these were con-
 Inmec.
 The number of extrajudicial killings continued to decline and the nature of viola-
 tions changed. In contrast with the past, government security forces no longer car-
 ried out campaigns that resulted in numerous extrajudicial killings. Nevertheless,
 members of the security forces were implicated in some extrajudicial killings and
 other abuses. Victims and their families no longer feared to speak out, and the Gov-
 ernnent demonstrated a willingness to arrest and prosecute those responsible. How-
 ever, the scarcity of law enforcement resources and a weak prsecutorial and judi-
 
 
 528
 cial system prevented the Government from adequately investigating many killings
 or other crimes or arresting and prosecuting perpetrators.
 The PDH's office, which generally compiles data based on personal interviews
 with victims and their families, listed 66 cases of possible extrajudicial killings in
 the first 6 months of the year, compared with 173 in all of 1996, and 216 in 1995.
 Using media reports and interviews with victims and their relatives, the Arch-
 bishop's Human Rights Office (ODHAG) compiled 118 reports of extrajudicial
 killings during the year, only 9 of which were confirmed, compared with 120 in all
 of 1996. MINUGUA listed 40 complaints of extrajudicial killings during the year
 and confirmed 40 cases, but many of those confirmed were from 1996.
 The final peace accord signed in December 1996 codified a cease-fire in effect since
 March of that year. By March the URNG guerrillas had peacefully assembled in de-
 mobilization camps, and by May they had relinquished their weapons. The military
 undertook a thorough restructuring and closed a number of military bases in the
 interior of the country. It had ceased counter-insurgency operations early in 1996.
 The signing of the Peace Accords and the Government's success in disbanding the
 PMA and disarming and disbanding the Civilian Defense Patrols (PAC's), which
 supported and supplemented the army during the years of conflict, helped create a
 more favorable human rights climate.
 The Government and human rights groups pressed charges against a number of
 former PAC members and military commissioners for crimes committed during the
 internal conflict. In a significant departure from past practice, a court convicted a
 military commissioner of murder in September for a 1994 killing. (Military Commis-
 sioners, formally decommissioned on September 15, 1995, were generally local civil-
 iap leaders who represented the army, serving as intermediaries with PAC mem-
 bers.) In a sign of changing public attitudes, the outcry following the acquittal of
 former military commissioner Candido Noriega of 158 criminal charges-mostly for
 crimes committed in the early 1980's-led to the suspension of the presiding judge
 and a successful motion for a new trial.
 Nonetheless, intimidation of witnesses continued to be a problem. For example,
 the chief prosecutor announced in September that he had received death threats
 similar to those directed against the prosecutor and the investigative team in the
 case of Alfredo Moreno, accused head of a customs fraud network. The team in
 charge of the investigation kept the witness list confidential, provided protection for
 witnesses since the investigation began, and arranged possible future asylum for
 some of them who are expected to provide sensitive testimony. Nonetheless, family
 members assert that a murdered customs agent, as well as four other persons, were
 killed to prevent their testimony. It is not clear, however, that any of those were
 planned witnesses. In another instance, on October 8, unknown assailants shot and
 killed Edgar Estuardo Motta Gonzalez in front of his house. Motta had testified that
 three policemen had kidnaped and shot him and a friend and left them for dead
 in February 1995. The friend died; the court found the police officers guilty and sen-
 tenced them to death. Motta had been provided witness protection for some time,
 but it was dropped after the conviction when threats appeared to have passed.
 Popular frustration with the inability of the Government to control crime, and of
 the courts to assure speedy justice, contributed to lynchings and mob attacks
 throughout the year. Statistics are not available, but reliable sources estimate that
 about 90 people were lynched during the year, about 45 of whom were killed by
 mobs, for alleged crimes ranging from murder to petty theft. There was no evidence
 that these mobs were incited for political reasons. Most of the attacks took place
 in rural areas. The police, sometimes with the assistance of the military or volun-
 teer firemen, were often successful in rescuing victims of mob attacks. The Govern-
 ment opened prosecutions against the instigators of a few of these attacks.
 On October 28, former Minister of Government Danilo Parrinello Blanco, former
 Vice-Minister of Government Mario Alfredo Merida Gonzalez, and former police
 chief Salvador Figueroa, who were sentenced in July to 10 years in prison for the
 1994 death of Umversity of San Carlos student demonstrator Mario Alioto Sanchez,
 were absolved of homicide charges on appeal. In a controversial ruling, a lower court
 had found the three guilty, given their places in the chain of command, of issuing
 orders to the police to use force if necessary to maintain order. The appeals court
 found that the verdict violated the Constitution and cited laws granting protection
 to government officials taking measures to preserve public order. The appeals court
 also absolved a policeman sentenced to 10 years in the July verdict and reduced
 charges against Carlos Venancio Escobar Fernandez, the policeman who shot
 Sanchez, from first degree murder to unintentional homicide; his sentence was cut
 from 30 years to 10. Police officers accused of lesser charges against other students
 were also absolved.

 On November 21, former PAC member Juan Acabal Pazan was convicted and sen-
 tenced to 30 years in prison for his role in the 1993 murder of newspaper publisher
 and former presidential candidate Jorge Carpio and three others. The court also
 convicted Acabal of two other 1993 murders unrelated to the Carpio case. (The 30-
 year sentence is for all six murders for which Acabal was found guilty.) Charges in
 the Carpio case remain pending against six other former PAC members, all of whom
 were allegedi  a  of a gang; all remained at large at year's end.
 There have been about 100 cemeteries exhumed in the past 5 years. Most of the
 bodies recovered have been those of victims of militay or paramilitary killings in
 areas like Rabina, Las Dos Erres, and Panzos. Forensics groups are using the infor-
 mation obtained from the exhumations to verify eyewitness reports of massacres
 and to determine at least in general who might have been responsible. The evidence
 may be used in some criminal cases and in the report of the recently formed Histori-
 cal Clarification Commission (CEH-see Section 4). The ODHAG's Forensic Anthro-
 pology Unit exhumed a burial site at Chacalte at the CEHl's request. The unit found
 almost 200 victims of a guerrilla massacre, most of them women and children, and
 most decapitated. A few survivors reported that the guerrillas took several hours
 to kill the populac of Chacalte and didn't want the noise of bullets to scare others
 away before the patrol could finish. No case based on evidence from an exhumation
 has yet been brought to court. The 1982 military massacre at Las Dos Erres is ex-
 pected to be the first case; it was still under investigation at year's end.
 Judicial proceedings continued in the case of the October 1995 killing of 11 re-
 turned refugees at the Xaman ranch in Alta Verapaz by an army patrol. In January
 1996, the Constitutional Court upheld the constitutionality of a statute defining
 extrajudicial killing. Hearings on procedural questions have been exhausted and the
 trial was expected to proceed in early 1998. The 24 soldiers accused in the case re-
 mained in jail pending trial.
 In September a court sentenced former military commissioner Armando Tucuba
 to 20 years in prison with no parole for the 1994 murder of evangelical minister
 Pascua Serech in Chimaltenango. It acquitted Paula Car Tibio, also accused in the
 Serech killing. Victor Roman, an alleged collaborator with Tucuba and also the ac-
 cused perpetrator of the 1995 murder of evangelical pastor Manuel Saquic, re-
 maine a lae despite an order for his capture and an offer of a reward.
 In August the authorities reactivated the case of the 1994 murder of Constitu-
 tional Court president Epaminondas Gonzalez Duben. A lower court raised the
 charges against Marion Oliver Salazar Lopez and Roberto Antonio Trabanino
 Varas from homicide to first degree murder, a third person accused in the case,
 Mario Rene Salazar Lopez, brother of Marlon, remained at large.
 The August 1994 killig of three workers at the La Exacta fa m remained under
 investigation at year's end. Although the criminal case has stalled, negotiations are
 continuing with the Center for Legal Assistance in Human Rights acting as the
 community's representative in discussions with the Government, through th~e Presi-
 dent's Human Rights Commission (COPREDEH). The parties are in the process of
 amicable settlement procedures under the auspices of the Inter-American Coibmis-
 sion on jHuman Rights (ACR). Charges are still pending in the labor court, and
 a criminal case is still possible.
 A trial was expected to begin in early 1998 in the case against three military offi-
 cers accused of ordering the 1990 murder of anthropologist Myrna Mack. In October
 1996, the Supreme Court had ruled that the three officers would face trial under
 the previous Criminal Procedures Code, which severely lmnited the evidence against
 them, and that an earlier investigation of their complicity conducted by the prosecu-
 tion was inadmissable. The Constitutional Court overturned that decision in August;
 the trial is to proceed under the new Criminal Procedures Code, which allows oral
 testimony, and with new evidence from the prosecution's investigation.
 The Government announced in February that it had rached a settlement with
 the plaintiffs before the oACUR in the case of the murder of anti-PAC demonstrator
 Juan Chanay Pablo. The criminal case against the PAC members accused of killing
 Chanay in Colotenango during a demonstration in August 1993 remained before the
 courts, having been remanded for a retrial by an appellate court.
 The authorities arrested a former PAC member in March for the 1985 killings of
 American journalists Nicholas Blake and Griffith Davis. The investigation of other
 former PAC members for complicity in this crime is continuing.
 The December 1996 National Reconciiation Law, which provided amnesty for
 some acts related to the internal conflict, was narrowly interpreted by the courts.
 The courts denied amnesty to several high profile defendants, including the con-
 victed murderers of US. citizen Michael Devine and the army officers accused of
 ordering the murder of Myrna Mack. The only amnesties granted were to six URNG
 
 
 530
 members accused of transporting weapons and using false documents. On October
 8, the Constitutional Court upheld the constitutionality of the reconciliation law.
 There was no progress in resolving other past extrajudicial killings: The "white
 van case;" the 1989 disappearances of 10 university students, 5 of whom were later
 found dead; the 1990 killings of Salvadorans Hector 0 ueli Colindres and Gilda Flo-
 res; the 1990 disappearance of Maria Tin Tojin  dher daughter; the murder of
 Miguel Us Mejia, a member of CERJ (an indigenous hum an rights organization),
 and his wife, Lucia Ti Tum; the 1991 killing of Jose Luis Merida Escobar; the 1991
 disappearance of Diego Domingo Martin; the 1992 kidnaping, torture, and murder
 of Huehuetenango peasant Lucas Perez Tadeo; the 1993 shooting of street child
 Francisco Tziac; the 1993 shooting of student protester Abner Abdiel Hernandez
 Orellana; and the 1996 killing of Narciso Alcor.
 b. Dippearance.-There were no credible reports of disappearances attributed to
 official forces.
 The PDH-s office investigated 17 complaints of forced disappearance in the first
 half of 1997, ompared with 47 for all of 1996. While motives in the incidents re-
 ported by the PD H are difficult to determine, the victims were not, in general, politi-
 cally active. Using a more restrictive definition than the PDH, the ODIIAG reported
 no forced disappearances during the year. MINUGUA reported three complaints of
 forced disappearance. Min GUA and the PDH confirmed only one disappearance,
 the "Mincho case from 1996.
 In May MINUGUA reported that Juan Jose Cabrera, a guerrilla commander also
 known as Mincho, had been captured in October 1996, together with Rafael
 Valdizon Nunez, also known as  Isaias." The two were involved in the kidnaping
 of 85-year-old Olga Novella, the matriarch of a prominent Guatemalan family.
 Isaias was released in a negotiated exchange for Novella, but MINUGUA could not
 determine the whereabouts of Cabrera. MINUGUA concluded that the Presidential
 Military Staff was responsible for the capture of the two and criticized the Govern-
 ment for failing to cooperate with its investigation by denying MINUGUA represent-
 atives access to those it believes are responsible for the capture.
 Disappearances in high-profile cases from recent years remained unresolved at
 yea~s end. Arnoldo Xi, a community leader in Tixila, Purulha, Baja Verapaz and
 a member of CONIC (an indigenous and peasant rights group) remained missing.
 Armed men reportedly wounded him with gunfire and abducted him in March 1995,
 while he was taking part in a land invasion. The whereabouts are unknown of Sal-
 vador de la Rosa, a member of a military patrol who disappeared in March 1995,
 and of Lorenzo Quiej Pu, a member of CONDEG (an organization dedicated to help-
 ing Guatemalans internally displaced due to the armed conflict), who disappeared
 in January 1994. The disappearances of San Marcos PAC members Margarito Lopez
 and Obdulio Zapeta, army enlisted man Diego Chel Matom, and farmers Ramona
 Munoz and Maritza Gil, who were allegedly kidnaped in 1993 by guerrillas, also re-
 mained unresolved at year's end.
 Legal developments in court cases failed to shed any light on the fate of guerrilla
 leader Efrain Bamaca Velasquez, who disappeared following a March 1992 clash be-
 tween army and URNG forces. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights has not
 yet ruled on a case it accepted in 1996 against the Government regarding Bamaca's
 disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution provides for the integrity and security of the person and prohibits
 physical or psychological torture of prisoners. However, there were credible reports
 of mistreatment by members of the security forces.
 The PDH's office listed only 1 potential case of torture in 1997, compared with
 12 in 1996. The ODHAG listed no cases of torture, compared with four cases in 1996
 and five cases in 1995.
 Casa Alianza and the COPREDEH reported no instances in which the National
 Police abused street children. Other groups cite abuses of street children, cases that
 Casa Alianza and the PDH attribute to family members, gangs, and in some cases
 private security guards. Since November 1996, the courts have convicted five people,
 including two police officers and one military officer, of abusing street children. The
 criminal case against the five policemen charged in the March 1994 baton beating
 of Luis Antonio Roldan Izeppi remained pending.
 Reports of police use of excessive force in evictions tangibly declined. Landless
 peasants occupied a number of farms throughout the year in attempts to gain land.
 Although some of the invaders were armed, the occupations were generally peaceful.
 Because of violent confrontations in the past, the Government's polic was to secure
 an eviction order from an appropriate court, inform the occupiers of the coming evic-
 tion, and send in a lightly armed contingent of police to end the occupation. The
 
 
 Ministry of Government carried out numerous evictions without incident during the
 year using this policy.
 Corruption continued to be a problem with the old police force, and there were
 credible allegations of involvement by some individual police in criminal activity, in-
 cluding kidnaping. The Government is in the process of training and fielding a new
 National Civilian Police. All PNC members must meet minimum education require-
 ments and pass an entrance examination. All members of the old force were to un-
 dergo significant retraining before incorporation into the new force. New recruits
 must complete a 6-month training course before entering on duty. The training
 course, developed with the assistance of MINUGUA and other countries and inter-
 national organizations, includes extensive human rights components. A total of
 1,200 PNC officers entered on duty in Guatemala City in July. Government plans
 call for 20,000 PNC officers to be on duty around the country by 2000, up from the
 current force of 12,000.
 In May the IACHR found that the Cerezo government had violated the human
 rights of US. citizen nun Dianna Ortiz in 1989. Following this decision, at the re-
 quest of the Public Ministry, the presiding judge ordered the case reopened. Pros-
 ecutors were studying how to take a written deposition from Sister Dianna in the
 United States that would be admissible in a Guatemalan court.
 Prison conditions are harsh but not life threatening. The prison system suffers
 from a serious lack of resources, particularly in the areas of prison security and
 medical facilities. The Government reports that prison capacity is 7,100 persons.
 Prisoners frequently complain of overcrowding, although there were approximately
 6,850 inmates at mid-year. Prisoners also complain of inadequate food. Corption-
 especially drug-related-is widespread. Prison officials report increasing incidents of
 escapes and other manifestations of prisoner unrest. Female prisoners are held in
 facilities separate from men, and minor children are held in other detention facili-
 ties.
 The Government permits access to prisons by family members and independent
 international monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Despite legal safeguards, there were fre-
 quent credible reports of arrests without judicial warrants, illegal detention, and
 failure to adhere to prescribed time limits in legal proceedings. The Constitution re-
 quires that a court-issued arrest warrant be presented to a suspect prior to arrest
 unless he is caught in the act of committing a crime. Police may not detain a sus-
 pect for over 6 hours without bringing the case before a judge. The law also provides
 or bail and access to lawyers.
 There are no reliable data on the number of arbitrary detentions, although most
 accounts agree that the security forces routinely ignore writs of habeas corpus in
 cases of illegal detention. There were approximately 6,400 men and 450 women im-
 prisoned at mid-year. Reliable estimates suggest that about 70 percent have been
 sentenced, and 30 percent are awaiting sentencing. Prisoners are often detained
 past their legal trial or release dates. Prisoners are sometimes not released in a
 timely fashion after completing their sentences due to the failure of judges to issue
 the necessary court order.
 The Constitution prohibits exile, and it is not practiced. There are instances of
 threatened individuals fleeing the country.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. Although independent, the judicial system often fails to provide fair trials due
 to inefficiency, corruption, and intimidation of judges and prosecutors. The courts'
 response to human rights violations, as well as to general criminal activity, has
 been inadequate. Members of the judiciary and prosecutors continued to receive
 threats aimed at influencing current decisions or as reprisals for past decisions. On
 September 29, the judge in a court responsible for investigating and bringing
 charges against a diug trafficking ring announced his resignation on account of
 death threats. Judge Victor Hugo Salguero complained that he was not even allowed
 time off to move his family to a safer location. The Supreme Court asked President
 Arzu to provide increased security for judicial personnel assigned to sensitive cases
 or to areas of conflict. The Court stated that justice suffers when judges are pres-
 sured to free prisoners, disallow evidence, or delay trials on technicalities, all of
 which contribute to public dissatisfaction with the legal system. Public prosecutors
 and private plaintiffs also received threats.
 The judiciary is composed of a Constitutional Court, a Supreme Court, appellate
 courts, lower courts, and courts of special jurisdiction (e.g., labor courts). The Con-
 stitution provides that the Congress elect Supreme Court and appellate court mag-
 istrates from lists prepared by panels comprised of active magistrates, representa-
 tives of the bar association, and law school deans.
 
 
 The Criminal Procedures Code, which came into effect in mid-1994, provides for
 the presumption of innocence, the right to be present at trial, the right to counsel
 and the possibility of release on bail. Trials are public and verdicts are rendered
 by three-judge panels. The Code also provides for language interpretation for those
 who require it (see Section 5). The State's Public Ministry, which is independent
 from the executive branch, may initiate criminal proceedings on its own or in re-
 sponse to a complaint. Private parties may participate in the prosecution of criminal
 cases as co-complainants. Lengthy investigations and frequent procedural motions
 by both defense and prosecution often lead to excessively long pretrial detention.
 Inefficiency and corruption in the courts, Public Ministry, and police continue to
 impede the proper functioning of the judicial system and undermine the right to due
 process. In a departure from past years, the Supreme Court suspended several
 judges for irregularities in cases under their jurisdiction. A modernization plan for
 the judiciary drafted by the Supreme Court identified the following problem areas:
 Inadequacy in carrying out court fu~nctions, limited access to administration of jus-
 tice, corruption, deficient institutional management, and lack of confidence in the
 court system by the public. A peace accord-mandated commission including promi-
 nent jurists, scholars, and a human rights activist issued recommendations for con-
 stitutional reforms intended to improve the functioning of the judicial system. In Oc-
 tber Congress passed a bill implementing these recommendations, one of which cre-
 ates a pilot program of five community courts in an effort to decentralize justice and
 incorporate customary law for minor offenses.
 The Public Ministry has been hampered in its efforts to investigate crimes and
 prosecute offenders by inadequate training and equipment and insufficient numbers
 of investigators. In addition, prosecutors are susceptible to intimidation and corrup-
 tion. One key reform during the year was standardization of procedures to govern
 criminal investigations. Coordination of investigations between the Public Ministry
 and the PNC is improving, due to a new coordinating committee composed of rep-
 resentatives from the Supreme Court, the Ministry of Government, and the Public
 Ministry.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitray Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of home, correspondence, and private doc-
 uments, but accusations persist that the authorities sometimes disregard these pro-
 visions. Elements of the security forces reportedly continue to monitor private com-
 munications. Press reports repeatedly accused the Presidential Military Staff of tele-
 phone tapping.
 The military has honored the June 1994 presidential order to suspend all con-
 scription, including forced recruitment.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion, and the Government generally respected this ri  in ractice.
 In addition to regular and open criticism of government policies, the media pub-
 licizes communiques from human rights organizations, unions, and others opposed
 to the Government or its policies. The press criticizes the military and other power-
 ful sectors. For example, press reports of the disappearance of Juan Jose Cabrera
 (see Section 1.b.) and the EMP's role in antikidnaping operations preceded the
 MINUGUA investigation. The press also ran stories on reputed drug traffickers and
 on official corruption.
 Some journalists claim, however, that in a few particularly sensitive cases govern-
 ment pressure and fears of reprisal result in self-censorship and limits on investiga-
 tive reporting. There were aiegations throughout the year that the Government or
 those purporting to speak on its behalf sought to discourage advertisers from buying
 space or tmne in media outlets deemed hostile to the Government.
 The Government pr epard e public information programs, which the radio and tele-
 vision stations ae re ried to broadcast. Opposition parties have no such access to
 the media, but can purchase air time.
 In early December, the Government's official news organ attacked the leading
 daily newspaper for publishing an article perceived as harming the Government's
 efforts to attract greater tourism. In response to the incident, the Human Rights
 Ombudsman declared that the Government's criticism, as well as other direct and
 indirect intimidation, constituted violations of the right to freedom of expression.
 One section of the 1996 Telecommunications Law sought to rationalize the licens-
 ing of radio frequencies. An unintended effect left a number of tiny local and com-
 munity-owned stations operating without legal authority..These stations broadcast
 cultural, educational, and religious programming to rural communities with large
 indigenous populations. Although the authorities have the right to close stations
 
 
 533
 that have not complied with the new requirements, none have been shut down.
 Some station owners believe that these requirements restrict their right to free ex-
 pression.
 The PDH reported two complaints of threats against journalists, only one of which
 merited investigation. The ODHAG reported no incidents of violence or threats
 against the media. However, some journalists reported threats of varying degrees
 of credibility, it is not clear whether the threats were related to their work. One
 journalist, Jorge Luis Marroquin Sagastume, was killed in Jocotan, Chiquiniula, in
 June. By year's end, the investigation had not yet revealed a motive, although some
 press reports implicated the mayor of Jocotan.
 The Constitution provides for academic freedom. There were no reports of profes-
 sors or students being subjected to violence or intimidation for their academic work.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly, and the Government respects this right in practice.
 Peaceful demonstrations were common, and demonstrators sometimes occupied gov-
 ernment institutions, including Congress. In all these cases, the police acted with
 restraint, and the authorities negotiated a peaceful departure of the demonstrators.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and the Government re-
 spects this right in practice. The Government did not interfere with political associa-
 tions. The law requires organizations to obtain legal status, a cumbersome and ex-
 pensive procedure.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for religious freedom, and the
 authorities respect it in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict foreign travel, nor does it revoke citi-
 zenship for political reasons. The Government did not restrict travel within the
 country during the year.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting ref-
 Rgees from other countries. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise.
 There were no reports of forced expulsion of persons to countries where they feared
 persecution. Voluntary repatriation of refugees from Mexico continued. The UNHCR
 reported that approximately 2,500 refugees returned, bringing the total to over
 35,000 since initiation of the program in 1993.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern.
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government by peaceful and democratic
 means through secret-ballot and universal suffrage for those 18 years of age and
 older. Members of the armed forces and police may not vote. Since the return to
 democracy and civilian rule in 1985, there have been seven free elections. Inter-
 national observers concluded that both the 1995 general elections and the 1996 run-
 off presidential election were free and fair. At year's end, the former URNG guerril-
 las were forming a political party and planned to compete in the 1999 general elec-
 tions.
 Voters elect the 80-member Congress using a system of proportional representa-
 tion based onpopulation, with deputies elected both from districts and from a na-
 tionwide list. Congress has 64 deputies from districts and 16 from the national list.
 The last elections involved 24 political parties; 6 won seats in the legislature. Con-
 gress can and does act independently of the executive, but fragmentation along
 party lines and a weak support structure result in a legislature that is relatively
 weak.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in politics, but women
 are underrepresented in the political arena. Nevertheless, women do hold some
 prominent political positions, including the presidency of Congress. In the 1995 elec-
 tions, voters elected 11 women to the 80-member Congress. Women hold two seats
 on the Supreme Court and one on the Constitutional Court.
 Indigenous people are entitled to equal rights under the Constitution. Some have
 attained high positions as judes and government officials, including eight members
 of Congress. In the 1995 elections, 40 indigenous candidates won mayoral positions
 (out of 300 municipalities), includingthe mayor of Quetzaltenango, the second larg-
 eat city. Nonetheless, they are still heavily underrepresented in politics due to lima-
 ied educational opportunity and pervasive discrimination (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vest igation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government permits local human rights groups to operate freely. Numerous
 domestic and international groups investigate and freely report on human rights is-
 
 
 sues. MINUGUA maintains a staff of 300 with regional offices to monitor implemen-
 tation of the human rights provisions of the Peace Accords and to strengthen demo-
 cratic institutions. MINUGUA states that the Government generally cooperated
 with its investigations but cited isolated incidents in which the Government had ob-
 structed its efforts (see Section 1.b.). The President's Commission on Human Rights
 actively sought to forge a more cooperative relationship with both domestic and
 international human rights monitors, often acting as a liaison between such groups
 and other branches of the Government.
 The Human Rights Ombudsman is elected by and reports to Congress and often
 rules on controversial issues not normally considered human rights topics, such as
 Tasoline prices and electricity rates. Relations between the Ombudsman's office and
 te executive branch were strained. Ombudsman Jorge Mario Garcia Laguardia
 complained that the Congress was neither funding his office adequately nor imple-
 menting his recommendations on human rights, although the office was hampered
 by internal administrative problems. Garcia's term as Ombudsman expired in Au-
 gust; Julio Arango Escobar replaced him.
 Several members of Congress, who are also leaders of human rights groups, re-
 ported receiving threatening letters at various times during the year. Other high-
 ranking officials working in the fields of human rights and jurisprudence coi-
 plained publicly and privately of receiving threats stemming from their interest in
 resolving cases related to human rights violations, official corruption, and drug traf-
 ficking.
 The Historical Clarification Commission, created by the Peace Accords in an effort
 to shed light on human rights abuses during past decades began work on September
 1. Various human rights groups gave the CEH voluminous documentation of viola-
 tions, and the CEH is seeking additional information on its own. Human rights
 groups expect the CEH to provide concrete answers on specific cases, even though
 the CEH has no mandate to bring to justice those responsible for abuses; only to
 provide an accounting of what happened. The CEH has one year in which to com-
 plete its work.
 MINUGUA, the PDH's office, and the ODHAG continued to enjoy widespread pub-
 lic support and respect. Senior government officials also met with numerous foreign
 government officials and international human rights monitors. While many inter-
 national human rights organizations and their workers do not enjoy formal legal
 status, they continue to operate freely and openly.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that all human beings are free and equal in dignity and
 rights, and that the State must protect the life, liberty, justice, security, peace, and
 development of all citizens. In practice, however, the Government is frequently un-
 able to enforce these provisions, due to inadequate resources, corruption, and a dys-
 functional judicial system.
 Women.-CONAVIGUA and the PDH reported that violence against women, in-
 cluding domestic violence, remains common among all social classes. There is no
 specific law against domestic violence, although it is considered to fall under other
 statutes. Victims rarely report criminal sexual violence, and relatively few rape
 cases go to court. The law allows a rapist to be exonerated by an offer of marriage
 in certain circumstances. If the girl is between the ages of 12 and 16, if she con-
 sented to sex, and if she agrees to marry the man, then rape charges can be
 e PDH reported that complaints of spousal abuse committed by husbands have
 continued to rise due to increased nationwide educational programs, which have en-
 couraged women to seek assistance. There are family courts, and judges may issue
 an injunction against an abusive spouse or companion. The police are charged with
 enforcing such injunctions. There is also a Women's Rights Department of the PDH,
 and various nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) provide medical and legal as-
 sistance and information on family planning. In September a Mixco man was sen-
 tenced to 6 months in jail for beating his wife, the first time that a criminal penalty
 has been applied in a domestic dispute.
 The Constitution asserts the principle of equality between the sexes. Nonetheless,
 women face job discrimination and on average receive significantly lower pay than
 men. They are primarily employed in low-wage jobs in the textile industry, agri-
 culture, retail businesses, and the public sector. More working women than men are
 employed in the informal sector of the economy, where pay and benefits are gen-
 erally lower. Women may own, manage, and inherit property on an equal basis with
 men.

 The National Women's Forum, the last of the commitments to create new civil so-
 ciety bodies under the 1996 Peace Accords, was formally inaugurated on November
 12. The general purpose of the forum is to broaden the participation of women in
 the economic and social development of the country. Local women's groups elected
 representatives to the departmental and national levels. In addition to representa-
 tives from the departments, the national assembly includes women elected to rep-
 resent linguistic communities. In line with the broad goals of the forum in promot-
 ing women's participation, improved access to education, health care, and credit
 were among the key topics for discussion. In effect, the forum serves as a channel
 for women to make their opinions known and to effect changes in law and adminis-
 tration to overcome discrimination and promote a more active role for women in so-
 ciety. The forum was scheduled to meet again 6 months later.
 Children.-The Constitution charges the Government with protecting the physical
 and mental health, as well as the moral well-being, of minors. These provisions not-
 withstanding, the Government in the past has not devoted sufficient resources to
 ensure adequate educational and health services for children. Under the terms of
 the Peace Accords, the Government has budgeted substantially more funding for
 health and education in 1998, almost double the 1995 spending level.
 The abuse of street children (see Section 1.c.) is a serious problem in major cities.
 Estimates of the number of street children range between 1,500 and 5,000, with the
 majority of these youths concentrated in Guatemala City. Criminals-reported to in-
 clude private security guards and corrupt police or military personnel-often recruit
 these children into thievery or prostitution rings. The Government and a number
 of NGO's operate youth centers, but the funds devoted to them are not sufficient
 to alleviate the problem. The Government created a Permanent Commission for
 Children and Youth in 1996 to investigate cases of mistreatment. The new Minors'
 Code, which offers greater protection for children, is scheduled to be implemented
 in 1998, in order to allow the Supreme Court time to prepare its staff to apply the
 new provisions.
 The Presidential Human Rights Commission continued weekly meetings of the
 Permanent Commission for Children, composed of representatives from Casa
 Alianza and from the judicial and executive branches, with the aim of addressing
 the problems of street children. The regular meetings continue, despite still tense
 relations between Casa Alianza and the police, principally due to old cases which
 the NGO believes the police investigated insufficiently.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution provides that the State should protect
 disabled persons. Nonetheless, physically disabled persons are discriminated against
 in employment practices and few resources are devoted to combat this problem or
 otherwise to assist people with disabilities. In November 1996, however, Congress
 passed a law mandating equal access to public facilities, prohibiting discrimination
 based on disability, and providing other protection.
 The new law defines a disabled person as one whose physical, mental, and emo-
 tional deficiencies limit performance of normal activities. It stipulates equal oppor-
 tunity for disabled persons in health, education, work, recreation, sports, and cul-
 tural activities and provides that all disabled persons receive the benefits of labor
 laws, social security, and the right to work. The new law also establishes equal edu-
 cation opportunities, the requirement that buildings meet access codes, and the
 right to equal pay. A National Council for the Disabled is to outline the political
 and internal needs of the disabled; however, implementation of the new law has
 been slow.
 Indigenous People.-The Constitution states that Guatemala is composed of di-
 verse ethnic groups and obliges the Government to recognize, respect, and promote
 the lifestyles, customs, traditions, forms of social organization, and manner of dress
 of indigenous people. Indigenous people constitute over one-half the population but
 remain largely outside of the counts political, economic, social, and cultural main-
 stream. Indigenous people were the most common victims of extrajudicial killings
 and other serious human rights abuses during the internal conflict. In an effort to
 implement relevant constitutional provisions, the Government established a series
 of commissions, as mandated by the Peace Accords. The commissions are to present
 recommendations to Congress regarding protection of indigenous culture, traditions,
 lands, and sacred sites. Indigenous people are organizing into interest groups, as
 well, to promote bilingual education, women's rights, and community development.
 The Government is also devoting increased resources to bilingual education.
 Rural indigenous people have limited educational opportunities and thus have
 fewer employment opportunities. Many indigenous people are illiterate and do not
 speak Spanish. Linguistic barriers hinder interaction with the Government and
 limit access to public services, including the judiciary, since few officials speak any
 of the 21 indigenous languages. Indigenous persons arrested for crimes are often at
 
 
 a disadvantage due to their limited comprehension of Spanish. The Criminal Proce-
 dures Code states that the courts must provide interpretation for anyone requiring
 such services during criminal proceedings. Ninety legal interpreters were working
 at all levels of the legal system, from the police to the formal courts, to assure non-
 Spanish speakers the means to bring complaints, resolve conflicts, and provide testi-
 mony. Interpreters are concentrated in farmer conflict areas of the country; more
 interpreters were in training.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the Labor Code provide work-
 ers with complete freedom of association and the right to form and join trade
 unions. The Government does not control unions. Major reforms to the Labor Code
 in 1992 mandated steps to improve worker rights by facilitating freedom of associa-
 tion, strengthening the rights of working women, increasing penalties for violations
 of labor laws, and enhancing the role of the Labor Ministry and labor courts in en-
 forcing the statutes. All workers have the right to form or join unions, including
 public sector employees with the exception of members of the security forces.
 At most, 8 percent of? the work force, or 250,000 of 3.1 million workers, are mem-
 bers of labor organizations. The 1,150 registered unions in the country are inde-
 pendent of government and political party domination. Labor Code amendments
 have simplified the process for unions to obtain legal status. The Minister of Labor
 further revised the administrative process in May 1996, reducing the number of
 steps within the Ministry for consideration of union applications and establishing
 strict timetables; the time for the procedure was reduced to 20 days from 60. The
 Labor Ministry also initiated a program to assist unions with their applications, and
 the Minister warned officials that noncompliance with the timetable could lead to'
 dismissal of those responsible for the delay. These new regulations accelerated the
 approval procedure and laely eliminated the backlog of union applications. The
 or Ministry granted lega status to 35 unions in the first half of 1997.
 Workers have the right to strike, but Labor Code procedures for having a strike
 recognized as legal are cumbersome. Labor organizers criticize the requirement that
 two-thirds of the work force must approve a vote to strike, the prohibition of strikes
 by agricultural workers at harvest time, and the right of the Government to prohibit
 strikes that it considers seriously harmful to the national economy. In 1996 Con-
 gress approved a law that further restricted the right to strike for workers employed
 in essential public services. The law was strongly opposed by unions and some mem-
 bers of Congress, who called the measure unconstitutional and contrary to commit-
 ment to the International Labor Organization (ILO). The law deems such services
 as urban and interurban transport, mail, and telegraph as essential; the Constitu-
 tional Court reviewed it in 1996 and declared it constitutional in January.
 Those strikes that do occur are frequently in the public sector and are almost al-
 ways called without legal authorization. The Government declared illegal a 1996
 strike by judicial workers; the workers eventually resumed their duties and were
 paid for the time they were on strike, a common outcome of such strikes. Previously,
 the Government made no effort to intervene on the basis of a strike's illegality, but
 the new essential services strike legislation permits it to act more forcefully. Em-
 ployers may suspend workers or fire them for absence without leave if the authori-
 ties have not legally approved their strike. The strike regulation law calls for bind-
 ig arbitration i an impasse has been reached after 30 days of negotiations.
 The law protects workers from retribution for forming and participating in trade
 union activities, but enforcement of these provisions is spotty. While an increasing
 number of employers accept unionization, many routinely seek to circumvent Labor
 Code provisions in order to resist union activities, which they view as historically
 confrontational and disruptive. An ineffective legal system and inadequate penalties
 for violations have hindered enforcement of the right to form unions and participate
 in trade union activities. While workers illegally fired for union activity should,
 under the Labor Code, be reinstated within 24 hours, employers often file a series
 of appeals, or simply defy judicial orders of reinstatement. Penalties for defying such
 orders were increased somewhat in the 1992 Labor Code reform.
 Trade union leaders and members did not suffer labor-related violence. Some pub-
 lic sector union leaders reported receiving threats against themselves and their fam-
 ilies. Investigations continued into previous years' cases of violence, including mur-
 der, against various labor leaders, although some of these investigations appear to
 have been suspended for lack of evidence.
 An active "solidarity" movement claims approximately 167,000 members in 437
 companies. Unions may legally operate in workplaces that have solidarity associa-
 tions, and workers have the right to choose between the two or to belong to both.
 The Government views these associations as civic organizations that need not inter-
 
 
 fere with the functioning of trade unions. The amended Labor Code stipulates very
 clearly that trade unions have an exclusive right to bargain collectively over work
 conditions on behalf of workers. Unions charge, however, that management pro-
 motes solidarity associations to avoid the formation of trade unions or to compete
 with existing labor unions. There are credible reports that some of these associa-
 tions did not always adhere to democratic principles in their formation and manage-
 ment, and that workers are unable to participate fully and freely in decisionmaking.
 Similar credible charges are made against some trade unions.
 At the request of trade union leaders the independent human rights Ombuds-
 man, through its office for economic and social issues, receives complaints related
 to trade union activities. Union leaders and workers fied occasional complaints with
 the PDH during the year, and the Ombudsman has spoken out in public statements
 about labor conditions in various sectors of the economy. The PDH can investigate
 union complaints and issue a statement, but the office has no enforcement powers
 beyond attempting to ameliorate the situation through publicity and moral persua-
 sion.
 Unions may and do form federations and confederations and join international or-
 ganizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers have the right to or-
 ganize and bargain collectively. However, the practice of collective bargaining is lim-
 ited by the we structure of the union movement, the requirement that 25 percent
 of the workers in a factory or business must be union members in order for collec-
 tive bargaining to take place, the lack of experience with this practice, and the pref-
 erence of management in many cases to avoid formal ties with trade unions. While
 both management and the unions honored some well-written collective contracts, in
 other instances both parties openly ignored and violated contracts. Most workers,
 even those organized by trade unions, do not have collective contracts to cover their
 wages and working conditions but do have individual contracts as required by law.
 Most workers receive the minimum wages established by bipartite commissions,
 which operate under the guidance of the Ministry of Labor.
 Employers cannot legally dimiss workers for helping to form a trade union; work-
 ers file complaints in this regard with the labor inspectors for resolution. The Labor
 Code provides for the right of employers to fire union workers for cause, permits
 workers to appeal their dismissal to the labor courts, and requires the reinstate-
 ment within 24 hours of any union worker fired without cause. The revised Code
 prohibits employers from firing workers for union organizing and protects them for
 60 days following the official publication of approval of the union. It also prohibits
 employers from firing any meiber of the executive ommittee of a union and pro-
 tects them for an additional 12 months after they are no longer on the executive
 committee. An employer may fire a member of the union's executive committee for
 cause only after a trial and issuance of a court resolution.
 Labor courts responsible for enforcing labor laws continued to be generally ineffec-
 tive. Although two labor courts, the sixth and seventh, continued to function, efforts
 to restructure and modernize the labor court system made little headway. However,
 in November 1996 the president of the Supreme Court announced creation of eight
 new labor courts and two appeals courts. Seven of the new labor courts have been
 constituted and are accepting cases. A heavy backlog of labor cases continued to clog
 the courts due to inefficiency and lack of resources, especially competent judges.
 There is only spotty enforcement of the Labor Code, due to the scarcity of labor in-
 spectrs, continuing though declining corruption, the lack of adequate training and
 resources, and structural weaknesses in the labor court system. Nonetheless, en-
 forcement is improving as new labor inspectors complete training and begin work
 at the 21 branch offices outside the capital, allowing the Ministry of Labor to in-
 crease significantly its rate of inspections. The Ministry continued a series of inspec-
 tions at iare an plantations in rural areas, especially in Alta and Baja Verapaz,
 and cited those employers who were not paying the minimum wage. The number
 of ranches in these regions paying below the minimulb wage dropped from 42.6 per-
 cent of the total number inspected to 13.9 percent after completion of the program.
 The Ministry of Labor reorganized its labor inspector corps to permit some com-
 plaints to be heard at the Ministry of Labor rather than requiring that inspectors
 travel to each work site. The Ministry increased the number of court cases filed for
 failure to comply with the Labor Code and has begun an educational campaign on
 worker rights (especially the rights of minors and female workers), including provid-
 ing some documents in indigenous languages. In an effort to improve enforcement
 of the Labor Code outside the capital, the Ministry of Labor began an effort to de-
 centralize its operations, beginning by opening a branch office in Coban, Alta
 Verapaz, in addition to the 21 labor inspector branch offices.

 Labor laws and regulations apply throughout the country, including in the few ex-
 port processing zones (EPZ's). The laws governing the EPZ's are not discriminatory
 on the subject of organizing trade unions or collective bargaining. Union leaders
 often blame employer pressures and their unofficially restricted access to the EPZ's
 for their virtual inability to organize workers in these zones. While labor standards
 in the EPZ's are no different from those found outside the zones, actual working
 conditions are often better.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution bars forced or
 compulsory labor, and the practice does not exist. The law does not specifically pro-
 hibit forced or bonded labor by children, but they are covered by the general statute.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Con-
 stitution bars employment of minors under the age of 14 without written permission
 from the Ministry of Labor. However, children below this age are regularly em-
 ployed in the informal and agricultural sectors, usually in small aiy enterprises.
 The laws prohibit minors from night work and extra hours (the legal workday for
 minors under the age of 14 is 6 hours; for minors 14 to 17 years of age, 7 hours),
 from working in establishments where alcoholic beverages are served, or from work-
 ing       eng the employment of mi-
 nors are not effectively enforced, due to the shortage of cualified labor inspectors
 and structural weaknesses in the labor court system. While oniy 5,000 minors have
 permission from the Labor Ministry to work legally, thousands of others working
 without legal permission are open to exploitation, generally receiving no social bene-
 fits, social insurance, vacations, or severance pay, and below minimum salaries.
 The Labor Ministry has a program to educate minors, their parents, and employ-
 ers on the rights of minors in the labor market. Economic necessity, however, forces
 most families to have their children seek some type of employment to supplement
 family income. Children who work generally do so in family enterprises. There is
 no forced or bonded labor of children (see Section 6.c.). There are no expert indus-
 tries in which child labor is a significant factor.
 The Constitution provides for compulsory education for all children up to the age
 of 12 or to the sixth grade. However, less than half the population actually receives
 a primary education. Children in rural and indigenous areas are less likely to com-
 plete primary school.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Although the law sets minimum wages, the le-
 gally mandated minimum wage for most unskilled and semiskilled workers is not
 always paid. A bipartite committee representing labor and management in specific
 economic sectors is named each year to make recommendations for increases in the
 minimum wage. In the event that agreement is not possible, the Government may
 decree such increases. The most recent minimum wage increase took effect in De-
 cember. The basic rate is $3.28 (19.71 quetzales) for industrial workers for an 8-
 hour workday, including a required hourly bonus, and is $2.98 (17.86 quetzales) per
 day plus mandatory productivity bonuses for agricultural workers. The minimum
 wage is not sufficient to provide even a minimum standard of living for a worker
 and family. According to the U.N. Development Program, an estimated 80 percent
 of the population lives below the poverty line, including approximately 60 percent
 of those employed.
 The legal workday is 8 hours, and the workweek is 44 hours, but a tradition of
 longer hours remains in place due to economic conditions. The amended Labor Code
 requires a weekly paid rest period of at least 24 hours. Trade union leaders and
 human rights groups charge that workers are sometimes forced to work overtime,
 often without premium pay, in order to meet work requirements. Labor inspectors
 report uncovering numerous instances of such abuses, but the lack of stiff fres or
 strong regulatory sanctions, as well as inefficiencies in the labor court system, in-
 hibit adequate enforcement of the law.
 Occupational health and safety standards are inadequate. As with other aspects
 of the labor law, enforcement of standards that do exist is also inadequate. Workers
 have the legal right to remove themselves from dangerous workplace situations, and
 the law provides them with protection for their continued employment. However,
 few workers are willing to jeopardize their jobs by complaining about unsafe work-
 ing conditions. When serious or fatal industrial accidents do occur, the authorities
 generally take no legal -steps against those responsible. The Labor Ministry provides
 training courses for labor inspectors in health and safety standardsbut does not ac-
 cord them a high priority due to scarce resources. The Government does not effec-
 tively enforce legislation requiring companies with more than 50 employees to pro-
 vide on-site medical facilities for their workers, although most large employers do
 provide such facilities.
