 CONGO
 The People's Republic of the Congo is officially a
 Marxist-Leninist state and is governed by an elite group of
 party, cabinet, and military officials through the single legal
 party, the Congolese Labor Party (PCT). In the past year, and
 particularly since Congolese President Denis Sassou-Nguesso
 became the President of the Organization of African Unity,
 there has been a tendency toward a more open society with
 expanded contacts with the West. In addition to serving as
 President of the Republic and Head of Government, Sassou is
 also president of the party. The President nominates the
 13-member political bureau, the key policy-making group, which
 is approved by the 75-member central committee. Within the
 central committee, members from the northern regions of the
 country are in the majority and hold the balance of power, even
 though they represent a minority of the population. The
 military and security services are also firmly under the
 control of the northerners, and they ultimately hold the key to
 power in the Congo. The need to maintain consensus among the
 political leaders representing traditionally conflicting areas
 provides a check on arbitrary policies.
 The security apparatus, which is under the direction of the
 presidency, is headed by the state security organization (DSGE)
 and is patterned after those in Eastern Europe. Its principal
 objective is to protect the State against possible dissident
 activity. There are also party core groups in all ministries,
 labor organizations, mass organizations, and urban districts
 (arrondissements) which monitor the activities of coworkers and
 neighbors. In addition to the DSGE, there are the regular
 police forces whose discipline is generally improving with
 continuing Eastern European and Cuban training.
 With its small population (1.9 million) and relatively high per
 capita income (about $1,200), the Congo is one of Africa's most
 prosperous countries. The economy is highly dependent on oil,
 which in past years has accounted for over 90 percent of
 exports. In 1982 the Congo began to implement an ambitious
 5-year investment plan, concentrated heavily on infrastructural
 development, but by 1985 sharp reductions in oil revenues
 forced the Government to cut its budget in half and in 1986 to
 accept an International Monetary Fund adjustment program.
 The human rights situation in the Congo changed little in
 1986. Persons previously cited by Amnesty International as
 political prisoners were brought to trial in August on charges
 related to two acts of terrorism (bombings) dating from 1982.
 The trial was open to the public and virtually all of the
 proceedings were transmitted live on Congolese television. The
 defendants were convicted and sentenced to terms ranging from a
 5-year suspended sentence to death for the alleged leader.
 While not politically free, most Congolese go about their daily
 lives with a minimum of government or police interference.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reported cases of killing for political motives.
 
 
 CONGO
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported cases of disappearance for political
 motives.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The practice of beating suspects at police stations and at
 state security centers in the course of interrogations is not
 uncommon. Neither is it uncommon for the public or the police
 to beat thieves who have been caught in the act of stealing.
 Political prisoners are held incommunicado, and it is
 reasonable to assume that torture is used to extract
 information desired by the police that is not freely given.
 Several political prisoners held incommunicado in the past have
 since been freed and are now leading normal lives with no
 apparent ill effects. Some have managed to regain their
 earlier status and are serving as government ministers. In
 1986 there were no confirmed reports of torture of political
 prisoners who were held incommunicado. However, during the
 bombing trial in August, one defendant alleged in court that he
 had been tortured while in detention, and another defendant
 retracted statements he claimed to have made under duress.
 Amnesty International's 1986 Report noted that some detainees
 held by the DSGE in 1985 had reportedly been subjected to mock
 executions and repeated severe beatings. On October 1, Amnesty
 repeated its expressions of concern regarding "continuing
 reports of torture" in the Congo.
 Prison conditions in general are poor, and there is a lack of
 adequate food, hygiene, and medical care. Both detainees and
 prisoners may be visited by family or friends who bear the
 responsibility for providing food, medicines, etc.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Whereas the Constitution guarantees protection against
 arbitrary indictment, arrest, and detention, in practice a
 warrant is not required to make arrests. There is a legal
 requirement that a detainee be brought before an investigating
 judge within 3 days of arrest. The judge may then order
 detention for a maximum period of 6 months after which the
 detainee must be charged or released. However, this law does
 not apply in cases involving the security of the State, and
 some political detainees have been held for long periods
 without trial. Persons detained for nonpolitical offenses are
 entitled to an attorney. Despite the Government's steps to
 increase the number of magistrates and to improve the
 processing of cases, the administrative processing of cases is
 slow, and persons awaiting trial are often detained for
 considerable periods, even in nonpolitical cases. There is no
 independent bar association. At the time of trial, the
 defendant has the right to a lawyer; all lawyers are under the
 general authority of the Government. In criminal cases,
 defense lawyers are provided by the Government for those
 without funds.
 Whether a detainee is formally charged usually depends upon the
 seriousness of the crime and the economic situation of the
 family. For lesser crimes, the person is usually taken to
 jail, where he may be beaten and held for a few days, then
 released on bail pending a trial, which may or may not ever
 
 
 CONGO
 take place. A person accused of a serious crime (e.g., murder,
 rape) is held in prison until the trial, which may be months or
 even years later.
 There is no known forced labor in the Congo.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The legal system is not insulated from political interference.
 The Constitution provides for a Supreme Court which is in
 practice an arm of the executive rather than an independent
 body. The amended Constitution also provides for
 nonprofessional judges to be elected to all courts below the
 Supreme Court. The stated purpose of this change was to
 popularize justice", i.e., provide a role for tribal or
 regional peers to influence the formal judicial process.
 According to the law, any Congolese citizen may now become a
 judge but can adjudicate cases only in collaboration with
 trained judges. Each nomination must be approved by the party.
 By law, the right to a fair and public trial exists in all
 cases, and the judicial process is relatively fair and open for
 those accused of common crimes. Also, it is not uncommon to
 have a higher court reverse lower court decisions in
 nonpolitical cases.
 According to the Congolese Government, there are no political
 prisoners in the Congo. Ten persons cited by Amnesty
 International as political prisoners being held incommunicado
 in 1985 were tried in August 1986 and were convicted of crimes
 associated with two acts of terrorism (bombing) in mid-1982.
 Two of the defendants, Jean-Pierre Thystere-Tchicaya and
 Claude-Ernest Ndalla, were formerly senior government
 officials. The former received a 5-year suspended sentence,
 while the latter, who admitted hav-ing been in possession of
 illegal explosives, was sentenced to death. This death
 sentence had not been carried out by the end of 1986. The
 other defendants received sentences ranging from 10 to 20 years
 in prison. The trial was held in the Revolutionary Court, a
 special court with jurisdiction over political cases. There
 was no right of appeal. Virtually all of the proceedings of
 the trial were televised live. The attorneys for the
 defendants were quite vigorous and apparently competent in the
 defense of their clients. On several occasions, they publicly
 chided the Government for illegal practices, including torture
 and coercion, in its prosecution of the case. With the
 completion of the trial, there were no other known political
 detainees in Congo.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There is little interference by the Government with privacy,
 family, home, or correspondence. Citizens are not forced to
 participate in the party or its organs. In general, so long as
 a person does not engage in any activity which involves or
 implies opposition to the Government, he is not oppressed or
 harassed.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are restricted, despite guarantees
 in the Constitution. The State owns and controls the media
 
 
 78
 CONGO
 except for one weekly religious newspaper. The Government
 allows some domestic criticism of policies and programs judged
 not to be politically sensitive, but it does not allow its
 ultimate authority to be challenged publicly. Journalists may
 raise issues and concerns only within general guidelines laid
 down by the Government and the party. The Government/party is
 selective in the kinds of news and information it permits
 Congolese journalists to publish from various outside sources
 of information. Television viewers have access to Zairian
 media programs. A State censorship board reviews the content
 of newspapers, movies, books, and records. Publications are
 subject to censorship if they contain critical articles. For
 example, one issue of a church newspaper was seized and burned
 as a result of some mild criticism of the Third Party Congress,
 and a warning to the church was later published in the party's
 official organ. While the Government controls the local press,
 foreign journalists are generally permitted to travel freely
 once an entry visa and a special permit for travel to the
 interior are obtained. These are usually g:anted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of peaceful assembly is limited by the State's
 perceived self-interest. Political meetings-are permitted only
 for the party and its organizations. Government permission is
 not required for groups to assemble for religious and social
 purposes but is required for use of official facilities.
 Government authorization is also required to establish
 professional clubs and organizations, of which there are
 several.
 The labor code adopted in March 1975 is quite liberal in
 theory, and guarantees the right of association. However,
 given its past active political role, the labor movement is
 closely scrutinized and controlled by the Government and
 party. In practice, the party controls the unions, largely
 through the umbrella union, the Congolese Trade Union
 Confederation (CTUC), which is an appendage of the party. The
 party approves the national leadership of the CTUC. No group
 is allowed to form an independent, alternative union outside
 the party, which led to a complaint to the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) that the Congo was not observing the
 Convention on Freedom of Association (No. 87). The CTUC is
 represented in every ministry and state owned enterprise and
 serves on mandatory boards which include a union representative
 along with a member of the Government and the party. Known as
 the "determinant trilogy," this structure is responsible for
 ensuring that the three major points of view are represented in
 the decisioinaking process and serves as the Congo's form of
 collective bargaining. The CTUC unions are prohibited from
 striking, although wildcat strikes do occur with relative
 impunity. The local unions within the Confederation have been
 able in some instances to persuade the Government to provide
 workers with increased benefits. As long as political subjects
 are avoided, there is also a certain degree of democratic
 dialogue within the labor movement and with the Government.
 The CTUC maintains relations with recognized international
 organizations such as the ILO.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed by law. In practice, party
 members are prohibited from practicing any religion. Religious
 organizations (churches, the Salvation Army, etc.) must obtain
 
 
 79
 CONGO
 the Government's permission to work in the Congo. Jehovah's
 Witnesses, for example, are not permitted in the Congo,
 allegedly because Witnesses do not recognize the authority of
 the State. With these exceptions, the party does not normally
 interfere in religious affairs. The Catholic Church, the
 largest congregation, maintains a seminary for the training of
 its clergy and has missions throughout the country. Masses are
 held in the various local languages as well as in French. The
 Catholic Church publishes the only independent newspaper, La
 Semaine Africaine. Catholic and other missionaries are active
 in running private missions and clinics and provide other
 social services. While some of these services are joint
 ventures between church and government, many of the services
 formerly provided by churches have been abolished. The
 Government is officially atheist. Christmas Day is called
 Children's Day.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government exercises limited control over the internal
 movement of its citizens through identification card checks.
 There are control points in Brazzaville manned by soldiers who
 occasionally open fire on people who fail to follow their
 instructions or who inadvertently drive into restricted zones
 at night. Congolese citizens who wish to travel abroad require
 exit authorization from the Office of State Security. For most
 citizens this is a fairly routine process. However, those who
 are suspected of traveling for political motives encounter
 obstacles in obtaining such authorization. Government
 employees traveling abroad must obtain permission from the
 appropriate government office. Passports must be returned to
 the Office of State Security after the traveler's return from
 abroad.
 The Government exercises tight control over travel by
 foreigners in the Congo. Most visas are for one entry only,
 exit visas are required for nondiplomats, and those desiring to
 travel into the interior must obtain permission from the
 appropriate ministry.
 There have been no known instances of Congolese being refused
 the right to return to their country. Citizenship may be lost
 under conditions established in the nationality code. For
 example, citizenship may be lost by taking citizenship in
 another country or for conviction of espionage. There are no
 known cases of a native-born Congolese being denied citizenship
 as a punishment.
 The Congo is the home of about 1,200 exiles and refugees,
 mostly from surrounding central African states. While refugees
 are subject to surveillance and occasional harassment by the
 Government, there were no cases of forcible repatriation in
 1986.  The Congo is a signatory to the U.N. Convention and
 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, and a
 representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees is resident in Brazzaville. Amnesty International has
 expressed concern over the 1985 detention without trial of
 several Zairian asylum-seekers, including Antoine Gizenga, a
 former Deputy Prime Minister of Zaire.
 
 
 CONGO
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: the Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 While the President is the most powerful single person in the
 Government, his authority is limited by his need to maintain a
 consensus in the political bureau of the party. The balance of
 power in the political bureau and in the larger central
 committee is held by northerners to the detriment of the far
 more numerous southerners. Military officers occupy key
 positions among the ruling group and help ensure its
 continuation in power.
 The Congolese people do not have the right to change their
 Government through democratic processes. Opportunities for
 political involvement by Congolese citizens are limited to the
 Congolese Labor Party, including its "mass" organizations, and
 to participation in the national, regional, and local
 assemblies. No other political parties are permitted to
 operate. Party membership, which numbers approximately 8,700
 out of a total population of almost 2 million, is highly
 controlled and membership is awarded on the basis of loyalty
 and political performance.
 While the Third Party Congress in 1984 declared the National
 Assembly the supreme organ of state, its powers are in fact
 limited. The national, regional, and local assemblies are
 "elected" from single-party approved lists. Such lists present
 only one candidate for each position to be filled. However, the
 candidate selection process can involve a certain amount of
 give and take, and incumbents have been turned out of office in
 the process. Representatives of the National Assembly are
 chosen from all walks of life, including from traditional
 leaders, small farmers, and workers. The Assembly has some
 impact on social and economic issues, and assemblies at the
 local and regional levels may discuss issues before the
 decisions are made at the national level.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no human rights organizations in the Congo. Amnesty
 International was permitted to send observers to the 1986
 bombing trial.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Under the Constitution there is no official discrimination
 based on race, sex, religion, language, or social status. As
 noted, northerners carry disproportionate influence in the
 political and security organs. Women have the same rights as
 men in the private, political, and social domains. There is a
 large disparity in practice, however, between salaries for men
 and women, and women are relegated to a secondary role in the
 modern sectors of society. In traditional society, women are
 often the chief decisionmakers. Five women are members of the
 party's 75-member central committee, and one is Minister of
 Basic Education and Literacy, the only woman in the 27-member
 Cabinet. This latter position is important as the Congo
 historically has stressed the importance of literacy and
 devotes almost a third of its budget to education.

 CONGO
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Revenues from oil production allow the Government to employ
 large numbers of Congolese for various government organizations
 including state corporations. Working conditions for Congolese
 in the modern sector are generally good. These include a
 minimum working age of 16, a maximum 40-hour workweek, at least
 I day of rest per week, family benefits, and medical aid.
 However, there is no social security, and the minimum hourly
 wage is $0.34 for city employees and $0.29 for agricultural
 workers. Domestic workers must be paid at least $60 monthly.
 There is a code of occupational safety and health, although it
 is probably not enforced. While many Congolese have a
 generally high standard of working conditions and social
 benefits, most of the population is still engaged in
 subsistence farming.
