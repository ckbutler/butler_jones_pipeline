 AZERBAIJAN
 Azerbaijan is a republic with a presidential form of government. Heydar Aliyev,
 who assumed presidential powers after the overthrow of his democratically elected
 predecessor, was elected President in 1993. He and his supporters, many from his
 home region of Naxcivan, dominate the Government and the multiparty, 125-mem-
 ber Parliament chosen in the November 12 elections. The new Constitution, ap-
 proved by voters in November, established a tripartite system of government. It con-
 sists of an executive with strong presidential powers, a legislature with the power
 to approve the budget and impeach the President, and a judiciary with limited inde-
 pendence. Following  years of interethnic conflict between   Armenians and
 Azerbaijanis, forces of the self-styled "Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh" (which is not
 recognized by any government) occupy 20 percent of Azerbaijan's territory. While a
 cease-fire, and peace process continue, there are about 700,000 Azerbaijani refugees
 and internally displaced persons (IDP's) who cannot return to their homes. In the
 part of Azerbaijan that the Government controls, government efforts to hinder the
 opposition hampers the transition to democracy. In the part of Azerbaijan that Ar-
 menians control, a tightly controlled, heavily militarized ruling structure is in place.
 Police and the Ministry of National Security are entrusted with internal security.
 Despite the cease-fire, military operations continue to have an impact on the civilian
 population. There have been reports of cease-fire violations from both sides of the
 cease-fire line resulting in civilian injuries and deaths.

 Azerbaijan has a state-controlled economy rich in oil, gas, and cotton. An informal
 private sector, operating outside official channels, but often with ties to persons in
 the Government, is an increasingly important part of the economy. An international
 oil consortium moved forward its plans to develop several oil fields with a decision
 in October to use multiple pipelines to ship oil to world markets. In November the
 Azerbaijanis and foreign oil companies created a new international consortium to
 develop an additional oil field. However, the economy continued to suffer due to: the
 continuing effects of the breakup of the former Soviet Union; lack of economic re-
 form and privatiation; the closure of the Russian border for much of the year, and
 partial closures of the Iranian border for several months. The continued burden of
 over 700,000 refugees and IDP's as well as the loss in the Nagorno-Karabakh con-
 flict of significant amounts of productive agricultural land placed added strain on
 the economy. International assistance to the refugees and IDP's is critical to main-
 taining the population at the barest minimum standard of living. The Government
 is working with international financial institutions on a privatization program,
 which has not yet been implemented. Widespread corruption hampers economic de-
 velopment. The overall economic situation of the average citizen continued to dete-
 riorate, although in urban areas a small monied class, with trade and oil-related in-
 terests, has emerged. In Armenian-controlled areas, the economy is primarily agri-
 cultural and contriutions from abroad are an important supplement to the econ-
 me Government's human rights record continued to be poor. During a March
 coup attempt, government forces continued firing on opposition forces after a white
 flag was raised, resulting in additional deaths. One opposition politician died while
 in jail, while others complained of receiving poor medical care. The security forces
 arbitrarily arrest, beat, and detain persons and conduct searches and seizures with-
 out warrants. Through threats and intimidation, they also inhibited opposition polit-
 ical parties from carrying out a full range of activities. Prison conditions are harsh.
 Journalists were imprisoned for publishing a satirical article about the President,
 although they were later pardoned. Political censorship continued although at lower
 levels than in 1994. Some opposition parties and candidates were prevented from
 running in elections as a result of questionable registration practices. The elections
 themselves were flawed by multiple voting, widespread instances of official intimi-
 dation and misconduct, and chaotic, nontransparent tabulation procedures. The Or-
 ganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe/United Nations (OSCE/UN) Joint
 Electoral Observation Mission concluded that the elections "did not correspond to
 internationally accepted standards.* Government interference in the elections re-
 stricted citizens' ability to change their government. The Government tolerates the
 existence of some opposition political parties. It has demonstrated, however, a dis-
 regard for the right to freedom of speech, press, assembly, association, and privacy
 when it has deemed it in its interest to do so. Societal discrimination and violence
 against women are problems. Insurgent Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh and
 the occupied territories continued to prevent the return of IDP's to their homes. This
 resulted in significant human suffering for hundreds of thousands of people.
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-A coup attempt in early March re-
 sulted in fighting between government and rebel forces and the deaths of govern-
 ment and rebel soldiers. On March 17, during fighting in Baku, opposition forces
 raised a white flag indicating a desire to surrender. However, government forces
 continued to fire, resulting in additional deaths.
 On June 17, Shakhsultan Jafarov, former commander of the Naxcivan border
 guard, an activist of the opposition Azerbaijan Popular Front (APF), and a Member
 of Parliament was shot five times as he sat in his car while being arrested in con-
 nection with his alleged leadership of an illegal private militia. He died 2 weeks
 later, reportedly having been denied adequate medical care. No charges were levied
 against the perpetrators.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 All sides to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict still detain prisoners. In 1995 Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) delegates visited 221 people held in
 relation to the conflict. A total of 150 were freed dunn  the ear;, 39 by Azerbaijan,
 47 by Armenia, and 64 being held in Nagrno-Karabakh However, the ICRC still
 visits 71 people held in connection with the conflict. These 71 comprise 65 Azeris
 being held in Nagorno-Karabakh, 4 Azerbaijanis held by Armenia, and 2 Armenians
 held by Azerbaijan. The ICRC repeatedly asked the concerned parties for notifica-
 tion of any person captured in relation to the conflict, access to all places of deten-
 tion connected with the conflict, and release of all such persons. The ICRC also
 
 
 774
 
 urged the parties to provide information on the fate of persons reported missing in
 action.
 The Human Rights Center of Azerbaia     a roup connected to the Social Demo-
 cratic Party, reports that by July it had visitd 97 Azerbaijani prisoners of war in
 Nagorno-Karabakh. These prisoners were from 16 to 59 years of age. The group's
 report lists 929 prisoners whose locations are known out of 4,774 Azerbaijani citi-
 zens who are missing or known to have been taken prisoner in Nagorno-Karabakh.
 This number includes women, children, and elderly people in addition to soldiers.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or De grading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture is illegal; however, the security forces practice of beating prisoners during
 arrest and interrogation is widespread. On April 14, Farrukh Agaev was arrested
 and beaten by police for allegedly "reading (opposition-oriented) bulletins on a wall
 in Lenkoran." This is a typical example of complaints from those members of the
 political opposition who are detained by the Government.
 Supporters of former Minister of Internal Affairs Iskendar Hamidov claim that
 Hamidov, convicted on charges of beating a journalist and stealing government
 funds, has been denied medical treatment ior ulcers and kidney failure. In response
 to inquiries into Hamidov's medical treatment, the authorities reportedly inves-
 tigated the matter and found that Hamidov was not being denied medical care.
 Prison conditions are harsh. According to credible reports, food and housing are
 poor, and provisions for medical care are inadequate. There are repeated, credible
 allegations that prisoners are beaten. Rape in piisons does not appear to be com-
 mon.
 Various foreign embassies have petitioned the Government for permission to visit
 all prisons. In general, access to regular prisons for foreign officials is not a problem;
 however, access to those held in security prisons is denied.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrests made without legal
 warrant occur, and those arrested are normally brought to prison without notifica-
 tion of family members. It is often days before family members are able to obtain
 information as to whether someone has been arrested and where they are being de-
 tained. Family members do not enjoy the right of visitation. Such individuals are
 generally denied bail and often are not informed of the charges against them. Access
 to lawyers is often poor.
 Police and security forces regularly detained and arrested persons in conjunction
 with government efforts to restrict freedom of the press and opposition political ac-
 tivities (see Sections 2.a. and 2.b.). Various local estimates put the number of pris-
 oners and detainees currently under arrest on politically motivated charges at 70
 to 100, compared with about 25 at the end of 1994. Former Foreign Minister Tofig
 Gasimov was arrested in October, immediately after his name was placed second on
 the election list of the opposition Musavat Party. He was charged with having been
 involved in preparations for the March coup attempt. The authorities had informa-
 tion about the alleged acts for months, and the timing of the arrest appeared linked
 to the announcement of his intention to participate in the elections. The head of a
 "social defense committee for bank customers' rights" was arrested on July 4, for
 having formally protested the refusal of several banks to honor the withdrawal re-
 quests of those with savings accounts. Ramis Zeynalov, a civil rights attorney, was
 arrested without a warrant by police who came to his apartment in the middle of
 the night.
 Four journalists and two others involved in distributing a newspaper were con-
 victed in October of defaming the President by publishing satirical material about
 him. The journalists spent 6 months in prison awaiting trial. The President par-
 doned them in November, just before the elections.
 Azerbaijan does not practice forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for a judiciary with lim-
 ited independence. Supreme and Constitutional Court judges are appointed by the
 President subject to confirmation by Parliament. Lower level judges are appointed
 directly by the President with no requirement for confirmation. Judges have not
 functioned independently from other branches of government. The judicial system
 has been subject to the influence of executive authorities and has been widely seen
 as corrupt and inefficient.
 Courts of general jurisdiction may hear criminal, civil, and juvenile cases. District
 and municipal courts try the overwhelming majority of cases, but the Supreme
 Court may also act as the court of first instance, depending on the nature and seri-
 ousness of the crime. Azerbaijan's previous criminal justice system, including its
 courts, laws, and procedures, followed the Soviet model. The new Constitution
 adopted on November 12 made significant changes. These changes include introduc-
 ing the presumption of innocence in criminal cases, an exclusionary rule barring the
 use of illegally obtained evidence, and numerous other rights. Those arrested or de-
 
 
 775
 tained must be informed immediately of the charges against them. How the new
 Constitution will affect the operation of the criminal justice system remains to be
 seen.
 Prosecutors, like the courts, are organized into offices at the district municipal,
 and republic levels. They are ultimately responsible to the Attorney 6eneral, ap-
 pointed by the President and confirmed by Parliament. While in the past, prosecu-
 tors were very influential, prosecutors and defense attorneys now by law have equal
 status before the courts. Prosecutors direct all criminal investigations, which are
 usually conducted by personnel of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
 Cases at the district court level are tried before a panel consisting of one judge
 and two lay assessors. Judges frequently send cases unlikely to end in convictions
 back to the prosecutor for "additional investigation." Such cases may be either
 dropped or closed, occasionally without informing the court or the defendant.
 By law, trials are to be publicly conducted except when government, professional,
 or commercial secrets, or family matters could be revealed. Defendants may confront
 witnesses and present evidence. The court appoints an attorney for indigent defend-
 ants. Defendants and prosecutors have the right of appeal
 The statutory commitment to public trial has not always been upheld, for exam-
 ple, the trial of former Interior Minister Hamidov (see Section 1.c.) was closed to
 the public.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-It is
 widely believed that the Ministry of National Security monitors telephones, espe-
 cially those of foreigner" and prominent political and business figures. The plice
 have periodically raided the offices and homes of opposition press and political par-
 ties and their leaders, allegedly searching for illegal weapons or other materials.
 Usually conducted without any sort of warrant, these investigations often result in
 the confinement of the person to the Baku city limits or a brief jail sentence for
 questioning.
 During the summer, President Aliyev reportedly issued a decree that all highly
 placed government officials, as well as regional and municipal government officials
 and other employees must join his New Azerbaijan Party.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The new Constitution provides for freedom of
 speech and the press. However, there is no evidence yet that the Government will
 respect these rights in practice. Past practices have led journalists to exercise self-
 censorship. The Government officially censors the press for military purposes and
 subjects newspaper premises to searches and raids. In October the authorities closed
 the office charged with political censorship but left open a second censorship office.
 While opposition media reported a loosemng of censorship, some articles continued
 to be censored, especially articles personally critical of the President. The arrest and
 conviction of journalists who published an article satirizing the President (see Sec-
 tion 1.d.) reinforced this message. The OSCE/UN Joint Electoral Observation Mis-
 sion found that "Political censorship of party and independent newspapers . . . re-
 stricted the freedom of speech of political parties." Nevertheless, articles critical of
 government plicy and of hih government _figures apart from the President do ap-
 pear in the press. The press is able to publish articles about many controversial sub-
 jects such as the Nagorno-Karabakh peace process, allegations of government rig-
 ging of the elections, and failure of government leadership in the economic field.
 ewspapers may be closed for 1 month if they violate military censorship rules
 which restrict publication of military secrets.
 The number of newspapers remains quite large, with some estimates reaching 300
 or more, including newspapers operated by major and minor opposition parties. The
 price of newsprint, exceeding world prices by 30 to 40 percent, has forced several
 of the most prominent newspapers to halt publication for various periods and has
 forced some papers out of business entirely. The state-run printing monopoly also
 has raised its prices and acted to keep certain opposition newspapers out of its dis-
 tribution kiosks. Independent news distributors, however, continue to sell opposition
 papers.
 The Government controls most radio and television, and the opposition has little
 access to the official electronic media. During the election campaig, opposition par-
 ties and candidates received free air time to campaign and a wide variety of views
 were voiced, including some strong, direct criticism of the Government. However, in
 at least three instances, opposition candidates' statements were censored in part.
 There is an independent television station accessible only to the small number of
 Baku residents who own modern foreign-produced television sets. Bodyguards of the
 head of the state television and radio beat the head of this independent station ear-
 lier in 1995 in a clear attempt to harass the station off the air. There are about
 
 
 776
 10 other independent television stations in the country, but their operations are
 generally very limited. Independent radio is almost entirely entertainment oriented.
 Idependent television and radio outlets are generally reluctant to air controversial
 political topics because they fear Government retaliation.
 Correct political connections are a prime requisite for those seeking posts in gov-
 ernment-controlled institutions, including universities. However, there are several
 professors with tenure who are active in opposition parties. There were no com-
 plaints of abuse of academic freedom, or of censorship of books or academic journals.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.--The Constitution provides for
 these rights. While the Government tolerates the existence of most opposition par-
 ties, it disregards the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association when
 it decides it is in its interest to do so. The authorities frequently denied or ob-
 structed opposition requests for permits to hold demonstrations, and broke up "spon-
 taneous" demonstrations. It used a state of emergency declared in response to a
 coup attempt in October 1994 to bar meetings until it was revoked in June. While
 opposition parties have been allowed to hold-party congresses, some report arrests
 of party members who meet outside of Baku in groups as small as 10.
 Reports of harassment by the Ministry of National Security of political and
 human rights figures continued. Before the elections, the authorities disallowed sev-
 eral attempts to hold rallies in Baku to protest irregularities in the registration
 process. No clear criteria are cited when denying such groups permission to assem-
 ble. When an opposition newspaper issued a call for journalists to meet to discuss
 the prospective sentencing of journalists for satirizing the President (see Sections
 1.d. and 2.a.), police barricaded the street, and barred all visitors to the building,
 claiming that they had received a bomb threat. The editor of the newspaper was
 told that it was prohibited to call for such a meeting under the state of emergency,
 even though the state of emergency had been lifted several months earlier.
 Associations other than political parties are generally allowed to function freely.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for no state religion and allows
 people of all faiths to practice their religion without restrictions. The Government
 respects this provision in practice with one exception: because of the forced depar-
 ture of most of the Armenian population and anti-Armenian sentiment, Armenian
 churches remain closed. Other Christian groups can hold services and conduct reli-
 gious education activities. Azerbaijan's Jewish community has similar freedom to
 worship and conduct educational activities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The new Constitution provides for the right of all citizens to choose
 freely their place of domicile and to travel abroad. In 1995 the Government droppe d
 the requirement for an exit visa to travel outside the country. The Ministry of Na-
 tional Security enforces a long-standing restriction zone in the southeast on the Ira-
 nian border from which all nonresidents are excluded. There have been sporadic ef-
 forts over the past year to insist that foreigners obtain visas to visit areas outside
 Baku. Residents of border areas in both Azerbaijan and Iran are allowed to travel
 across the border in this restricted zone without visas.
 Prominent political and human rights leaders under criminal investigation are
 forbidden to leave the city boundaries of Baku. This limited their campaigning in
 the election period. This is true in the cases of Ali Karimov of the Azerbaijan Popu-
 lar Front (charged with concealing hand grenades in his pockets), who is prevented
 from leaving the country. It is also true for Isa Gambar of the Musavat Party,
 (charged in the events leading to the overthrow of the Elcibey government in 1993),
 who cannot travel outside of Baku. Other political activists have suffered harass-
 ment when traveling beyond Baku to meet party delegations in the countryside or
 when visiting refugee camps.
 The Government officially recognizes freedom of emigration. Jewish emigration to
 Israel continued, though it has slowed to a trickle. The remaining Armenian popu-
 lation in Azerbaijan is approximately 10,000 to 20,000, mostly people of mixed de-
 scent or in mixed marriages. There is no government policy of discrimination
 against Armenians, who are free to travel. Low-level officials seeking bribes often
 harass members of minorities wishing to emigrate.
 The Government officially notified all draft-age men to be prepared for mobiliza-
 tion in July. During that time, men between 18 and 45 years of age were forbidden
 to travel beyond their city or regional limits. Guards at the borders and at the Baku
 airport were on alert, questioning any young men they found. Draft-age men must
 obtain documents from military officials before they can leave for international trav-
 el. All citizens wishing to travel abroad must obtain a passport.
 The number of refugees and displaced persons in Azerbaijan is over 700,000. The
 Armenians have begun the settlement of Armenians in some of the occupied terri-
 tories. However, the Armenians have not allowed the hundreds of thousands of
 
 
 Azerbaijanis who were forced out of the now-occupied territories to return to their
 homes. These people continue to live in camps and other temporary shelters, often
 living at below-subsistence levels, without adequate food, housing, education, or
 medical care. All parties to the conflict have cut normal trade an transportation
 links to the other sides, causing severe hardship to civilians in Nagorno-Karabakh,
 Armenia, and the Azerbaijani exclave of Naxcivan.
 The new Constitution provides for political asylum consistent with international
 legal norms. The Government is receptive to international assistance for refugees
 and cooperates with international organizations to provide aid for refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 In theory, the new election law and Constitution allow citizens to change their
 government by peaceful means. However, the Government's interference in the No-
 vember 12 elections restricted citizens ability to peacefully change their government.
 The parliamentary elections were flawed, by, among other things, the banning of
 major opposition parties and candidates from the ballot through arbitrary applies-
 tion of signature requirements.
 The November 12 parliamentary elections and concurrent constitutional referen-
 dum were carried out following a registration process that inhibited full participa-
 tion and produced cynicism among the public. There were major problems during
 the party registration period in Augst. The Ministry of Justice initially decided not
 to register some parties because they opposed the Government. Following internal
 and international protests, almost all parties were registered. A Supreme Court rul-
 ing allowing the Communist Party to register was not issued, however, until mid-
 September. The Islamic Party, a prominent Iranian-controlled and -funded opposi-
 tion party, was not registered to participate in the elections.
 There were further problems when candidates and parties attempted to procure
 the necessary signatures (2,000 for individual candidates and 50,000 for parties) to
 qualify for the ballot. Several parties including the Musavat Party, a leading opposi-
 tion party, and the Communist Party were ruled off the ballot based on the judg-
 ment of so-called handwriting experts. These experts disagreed among themselves
 as to when signatures were valid, international observers suggested that more objec-
 tive and scientific methods be used to verify signatures. Large numbers of opposi-
 tion candidates for district elections were similarly ruled off the ballot. Opposition
 parties claimed their most capable candidates were ruled off the ballot, while more
 marginal candidates remained. There were widespread, credible reports that some
 candidates were allowed on the ballot after paying bribes to local and election offi-
 cials.
 The elections themselves were carried out in an uneven manner. The reported
 turnout of 80 percent was much greater than that observed by election monitors.
 They reported turnout in the 40 percent range in most areas. Turnout was inflated
 by multiple voting, with many instances of males voting for the entire family and
 local housing officials casting ballots for groups of residents. Election officials filled
 out ballots themselves in order to meet a perceived need to report high turnouts.
 The counting procedures at the district level were chaotic, with no effective control
 over ballots. In many instances local observers were barred from polling places for
 part of the   yor uring the counting process. This led to suspicions that votes
 were falsified. Local election results were not reported publicly, and the Central
 Election Commission only announced final results after a lapse of a week. There
 were many instances of local officials working hard to carry out free and fair elec-
 tions, and independent and party monitors worked to ensure a democratic process.
 Overall, however, the elections were flawed and mark only an initial step in a long
 process toward democracy in Azerbaijan.
 The final composition of the 125-member Parliament will not be determined until
 after special elections in February 1996--most members of Parliament likely will be
 either members of the President's party, or nominal independents closely aligned
 with the President. Several of the other parties represented in Parliament are also
 close to the President. There will be few opposition members. Opposition parties
 continue to be active outside the legislature, agitating for their views in their news-
 papers and through public statements.
 There are no legal restrictions on women's participation in politics. However, tra-
 ditional social norms restrict women's roles in politics. Men continued to vote for
 their wives and other female members of their families, an abuse that was widely
 noted in the November parliamentary elections. The number of women members of
 Parliament remains to be determined along with the final composition of the Par-
 liament. Currently the acting Minister of Justice and the Education Minister are
 the only women of ministerial rank.
 
 
 778
 There are no restrictions on the participation of minorities in politics as individ-
 uals. However, explicitly ethnically or religiously based parties were prohibited from
 participating in the November elections. Minority groups have in the past been able
 to form regional groups in Parliament. Indigenous ethnic minoritie-s such as the
 Talysh and Lezyhis fill some senior government positions; the deputy defense min-
 ister is Lezyhi; and the head of the electoral commission is Talysh.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government welcomed a joint OSCEUN monitoring mission for the elections
 and provided monitors with countrywide access. The ICRC has had access to pris-
 oners of war held in regular prisons but not to those held in special prisons.
 The local human rights community is still largely composed of individuals rather
 than well-developed organizations. Some of these individuals are beginning to orga-
 nize groups as they grow in stature and experience as evidenced by the appearance
 of over a dozen women's groups. These organizations and their leaders are subject
 to ha .assment, searches of their homes, and arrest. Attorneys who represent those
 charged with political offenses have been arrested and held for periods of several
 months in apparent retaliation for their active defense of their clients.
 However, the Government has met with delegations from human rights organiza-
 tions. Several local nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) have been formed to as-
 sist refugees and to carry out humanitarian activities. During the November elec-
 tion campaign, a local NGO produced an independent monitoring bulletin which re-
 ported on elecion-related rights violations and abuses in Baku. Several human
 rights groups investigate human rights abuses and disseminate their findings
 through the local media and the internet.
 The Government has also oyened its own NGO-style organizations, such as the
 Women's Rights Organization neaded by President Aliyev's daughter. This organiza-
 tion received government support and funds, whereas other independent, prominent
 women's rights' activists did not.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The new Constitution provides for equal rights irrespective of nationality, religion,
 rgender, national origin, social status, or political views. While it is to early to tell
 now effectively the new Constitutions provisions will be carried out, in the wake of
 the conffict over Nagorno.Karabakh there are strong anti-Armenian sentiments in
 society.
 Women.-Discussion of violene against women is a taboo subject in Azerbaijan's
 patriarchal society. In rural areas, women have no real recourse against violence by
 their husbands, regardless of the law. Rape is severely punishable, but, especially
 in rural areas, only a small fraction of offenses against women are reported or pros-
 ecuted. Police sources indicate that there are about 200 cases annually of crimes of
 violence against women. These figures probably'reflect underreporting, especially
 from the conservative rural areas. Crime levels, in general, have risen considerably
 due to the flood of refugees to the cities and the economic crisis of the past few
 years.
 Women nominally enjoy the same legal rights as men, including the right to par-
 ticipate in all aspects of economic and social life. In general, women have extensive
 opportunities for education and work. However, traditional social norms continue to
 restrict women's roles in the economy. In general, representation of women is sharp--
 ly lower in higher levels of the work force. There are few or no women in executive
 positions in leading businesses.
 The Association for the Defense of Rights of Azerbaijan Women spends most of
 its time fighting uniquely post-Soviet problems. It has helped widows whose land-
 lords "privatized" their apartments and then forced them to move out. It also works
 with divorced women who feel cheated by the divorce court.
 Children.-The Constitution and laws commit the Government to protecting the
 rights of children to education and health, difficult economic circumstances limit the
 Government's ability to carry out the commitments. The Constitution places chil-
 dren's rights on the same footing as adults. The Criminal Code prescribes severe
 penalties for crimes against children. The Government has attempted to shield fami-
 lies against economic hardship in the wake of price liberalization by authorizing
 child subsidies. The subsidies do not come close to covering the shortfall in family
 budgets, and the Government does not have the financial means to meet its new
 commitments. There are a large number of refugee and displaced children living in
 unhealthy conditions in refugee campsites. Children beg on the streets of Baku and
 other towns in Azerbaijan.
 
 
 779
 People With Disabilities.-The law on support for invalids, enacted in late 1993,
 prescribes priority for invalids and the disabied in obtaining housing, as well as dis-
 counts for public transport, and pension supplements. The Government does not
 have the means in its current financial crisis to make good on its commitments.
 There are no special provisions in law mandating accessibility to buildings for the
 disabled.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The outbreak of hostilities and anti-Arme-
 nian riots led to the expulsion of many Armenians and the departure of others. Esti-
 mates put the current Armenian population at 10,000 to 20,000. With the almost
 complete departure of the Armenian population there have been far fewer problems
 reported by ethnic minorities. Those Armenians who have not left are for the most
 part of mixed descent, in a mixed marriage, or have changed their nationality, as
 reported in their passports and documents, to Azerbaiani. As a result of the war
 there is a high level of animosity towards Armenians among much of the general
 population.
 Nonindigenous minorities, such as the Kurds of the Lachin region and the dis-
 placed Meskhetian Turks, occasionally reported problems of discrimination. The lat-
 ter, Turks originally from the Black Sea coast of Georgia, have been spread through-
 out Central Asia and the Caucasus, and want to return to their original homeland.
 While they suffer from economic hardship as much as any others in Azerbaijan, they
 are receiving help from the Government.
 Indigenous ethnic minorities such as the Talysh and Lezghis do not suffer dis-
 crimination.
 In the area of the country controlled by insurgent (Armenian) forces, about
 500,000 ethnic Azerbaijanis have been forced to flee their homes. The regime that
 now controls the contested areas has effectively banned ethnic Azerbaijanis from all
 aspects of civil, political, and economic life.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Most labor unions still operate as they did under the
 Soviet system and remain highly dependent on the Government. The new Constitu-
 tion provides for freedom of association, including the right to form labor unions.
 However most industrial and white-collar workers are organized into one or an-
 other sub-branch of the Azerbaijani Labor Federation, run by the Government
 (which also still owns most major industries). There is at least one independent
 labor union, the Independent Oil Workers Union, which is active in voicing the de-
 mands of the oil workers.
 There are no restrictions on strikes nor provisions for retribution against strikers.
 Oil workers conducted a 10-day strike in late August, demanding back pay. The
 strike ended when the workers received assurances that they would meet with the
 President. However, after the meeting took place, the workers' demands for pay-
 ment were not met. In general, there are no established mechanisms to avoid such
 wildcat strikes.
 Unions are free to form federations and to affiliate with international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining remains
 at a rudimentary level. Government-appointed boards and directors run the major
 enterprises and set wages. Unions do not participate in determining wage levels. In
 a carryover from the Soviet system, both management and workers are considered
 members of the professional unions.
 There are no export processing zones, although there is a U.N. Development Pro-
 gram-supported effort underway to create such a zone in Sumgayit.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is al-
 lowed by the Constitution only in case of martial law. It is not known to have been
 practiced. Two departments in the prosecutor's office (the Department of Implemen-
 tation of the Labor Code and the Department for Oversight Over Minors) enforce
 the prohibition on forced or compulsory labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children-The minimum employment age is
 16 years. Children of age 14 are allowed to work during vacations with the consent
 of their parents and certification of a physician. Children of age 15 may work if the
 workplace's labor union does not object. There is no explicit restriction on the kinds
 of labor that children of age 15 may perform with union consent. The Labor Min-
 istry has primary enforcement responsibility for child labor laws. With high adult
 unemployment, there have been few, if any, complaints of abuses of child labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets the nationwide adminis-
 trative minimum wage by decree, and raised it several times because of inflation.
 As of September 1, the minimum wage was approximately $1.20 (5,500 manat) per
 month. The recommended monthly wage level to meet basic subsistence needs was
 estimated to be $70.00 (310,000 manat). There seems to be no active mechanism to
 
 
 enforce the minimum wage. Since most people actually earn more than the mini-
 mum wage, this is not presently a major issue in labor or political debate.
 The disruption of trade links with the rest of the former Soviet Union continues
 to affect unemployment in many industries. Idle factory workers typically receive a
 small fraction-less than half-of their former wage. Under these conditions more
 and more rely on the extended family's safety net. This usually ends in a police offi-
 cer, customs official, or government official of some level whose "side income" may
 support many family members. Still mre turn to moonlighting such as operating
 the family car as a taxi, reselling bread on the street, or seling the modest produce
 from one s private garden. Using some combination of these and other strategies is
 the only way it is possible, though still difficult, for broad sectors of the urban popu-
 lation to reach the subsistence income level.
 The legal workweek is 41 hours. There is a 1-hour lunch break per day and short-
 er breaks in the morning and afternoon.
 Health and safety standards exist, but they are mostly ignored in the workplace.
