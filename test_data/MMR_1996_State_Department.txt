 BURMA
 Burma continued to be ruled by a highly authoritarian military regime widely
 condemned for its serious human rights abuses. The military Government, known
 as the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), headed by armed forces
 commander General Than Shwe and composed of top military officers, seized power
 in September 1988 after harshly sup pressing massive prodemocracy demonstrations.
 Retired dictator General Ne Win, whose idiosyncratic policies had isolated Burma
 and driven the country into deep economic decline, is believed by many to continue
 to wield considerable influence. The judiciary is not independent of the executive.
 The SLORC permitted a relatively ree election in 1990, but it failed to honor the
 results-which were an overwhelming rejection of military rule-nor to cede power
 to the victorious prodemocracy forces. Instead, the SLORC attacked the coalition of
 winning parties and their leaders through intimidation, detention, and house arrest.
 In January 1993, the SLORC established the "National Convention," a body osten-
 sibly tasked with drafting a new constitution. Overwhelmingly made up of delegates
 handpicked by the military forces, the SLORC has carefully stage-managed the Con-
 vention's proceedings and ignored even limited opposition views. Despite having no
 legal mandate, the SLORC appears determined to draft a constitution that would
 ensure a dominant role for the military forces in the country's future political struc-
 ture.
 The Government reinforces its rule via a pervasive security apparatus led by mili-
 tary intelligence, the Directorate of Defense Services Intelligence (DDSI). Control is
 buttressed Tby selective restrictions on contact by citizens with foreigners surveil-
 lance of government employees and other private citizens, harassment o? political
 activists, intimidation, arrest, detention, and physical abuse. The Government justi-
 fies its security measures as necessary to maintain order and national unity, al-
 though most major insurgent groups have reached accommodation with the S96RC
 in recent years. Members of the security forces committed numerous serious human
 rights abuses.
 Burma is a poor country, with an average per capita income of an estimated $200
 to $300 per year on a cash basis or about $600 to $800 on a purchasing power parity
 basis. Primarily an agricultural country, Burma also has substantial mineral, fish-
 ing, and timber resources. Since 1988 the Government has partly opened the econ-
 omy to permit expansion of the private sector and to attract foreign investment.
 Some economic improvement has ensued, but major obstacles to economic reform
 persist. These include extensive overt and covert state involvement in economic ac-
 tivity, excessive state monopolization of leading exports, a bloated bureaucracy
 prone to arbitrary and opaque governance, poor human and physical infrastructure,
 and disproportionately large military spending.
 The Government's severe repression of human rights increased during 1996, even
 as increased economic activity fostered the appearance of greater normalcy. Out of
 sight of most visitors, citizens continued to live subject at any time and without ap-
 peal to the arbitrary and sometimes brutal dictates of the military dictatorship. Citi-
 zens do not have the right to change their government. There continued to be credi-
 ble reports, particularly from ethnic minority-dominated areas, that soldiers com-
 mitted serious human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killing and rape. Dis-
 appearances continued, and members of the security forces beat and otherwise
 abused detainees. Prison conditions remained harsh. Arbitrary arrests and deten-
 tions continued for expression of dissenting political views. Several hundred, if not
 more, political prisoners remained in detention, including approximately 20 Mem-
 bers of Parliament (M.P.'s) elected in 1990. The judiciary is subject to executive in-
 fluence, and the Government infringes on citizens' rights to privacy.
 The SLORC intensified restrictions on basic rights to free speech, press, assembly,
 and association. Political party activity remained severely restricted. Although the
 authorities recognize the chief opposition party, the National League for Democracy
 (NLD), as a legal entity, they detained more than 260 NLD M.P.'s elected in 1990
 in connection with the Party's Convention in May. While most were released shortly
 
 
 599
 thereafter, seven remain in custody. The SLORC's relentless harassment of the
 NLD continued with the arrest in August and later conviction of 26 NLD activists
 on charges of spreading disinformation and threatening the stability of the State.
 In September the SLORC again prevented the NLD from holding its first All-Burma
 Congress and detained more than 560 NLD members and supporters, most of whom
 they released after questioning. In December, in the wake of student demonstra-
 tions, the SLORC detained more than 200 NLD activists and supporters whom they
 accused of aiding and abetting the student protests. At year's end, more than 147
 NLD activists and supporters who had been arrested during the year remained in
 detention.
 The SLORC restricted the political activities of opposition leader Aung San Suu
 Kyi (it held her under house arrest from 1989 until July 1995). Beginning in late
 September, it prevented her from addressing public gatherings of her supporters,
 and confined her to her compound from December 6 to December 29.
 Although more than 220,000 Rohingyas, Burmese Muslims from Arakan state
 who fled to Bangladesh in 1992 had returned by year's end, about 33,000 remained
 in camps across the border. An estimated 10,000 new asylum seekers entered Ban-
 gladesh this year. A few thousand students and dissidents remained in exile in
 Thailand. Approximately 90,000 citizens were residing in ethnic minority camps
 along the Thai-Burma border, among these thousands of new arrivals driven out by
 army attacks in the areas controlled by the Karen and Karenni ethnic minorities.
 Discrimination against women and ethnic minorities, violence against women, and
 child prostitution remained problems. The Government restricts worker rights and
 uses forced labor. The use of porters by the army-with attendant mistreatment, ill-
 ness, and even death for those compelled to serve-remained a common practice.
 The military authorities continued to force ordinary citizens (including women and
 children) to "contribute" their labor on a massive scale, often under harsh working
 conditions, on construction projects throughout the country. During the year, the
 military began using soldiers instead of civilians at certain infrastructure projects,
 following the issuance of directives in 1995 to end the practice of forced civilian
 labor. Child labor is also a problem.
 The SLORC has given no sign of willingness to cede its hold on absolute power.
 The generals have continued to refuse to negotiate with prodemocracy forces and
 ethnic groups for a genuine political settlement to allow a return to the rule of law
 and respect for basic human rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There was no evidence of an explicit
 or systematic government policy encouraging summary killings. However, there con-
 tinued to lbe credible reports of instances of brutality and killings of civilians by the
 military, particularly in areas dominated by ethnic minorities and among those im-
 pressed as porters. The Government's general disregard for human rights has cre-
 ated a climate clearly conducive to such abuses.
 b. Disappearance.-As in previous years, private citizens and political activists
 continued to "disappear" temporarily, for periods ranging from several hours to sev-
 eral weeks. DDSI officials usually apprehended individuals for questioning without
 the knowledge of their family members. In many, though not all, cases they released
 them soon afterward. At the same time, lhrge numbers of people continued to be
 conscripted by the military forporterage or other duties, often without the knowl-
 edge of their family members, The whereabouts of those conscripted, as well as of
 prisoners transferred for labor or porterage duties, remained difficult to determine
 (see Sections 1.g. and 6.c.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Political detainees continued to be held incommunicado for long periods. The au-
 thorities routinely subjected detainees to harsh interrogation techniques designed to
 intimidate and disorient. The most common forms of mistreatment were sleep and
 food deprivation, coupled with round-the-clock questioning; some detainees were
 also kicked and beaten. In recent years, there have been credible reports that pris-
 oners were forced to squat or assume unnatural positions for lengthy periods.
 There continued to be credible reports that security forces subjected ordinary citi-
 zens to harassment and physical abuse. The military forces routinely confiscated
 property, cash and food, and used coercive and abusive recruitment methods to pro-
 cure porters. Those forced into porterage or other duties faced extremely difficult
 conditions and mistreatment that sometimes resulted in death. There were many
 reports that soldiers raped women who were members of ethnic minorities.
 
 
 600
 Prison conditions are harsh. The regimen at Insein prison near Rangoon remained
 extremely harsh, including widespread use of solitary confinement, use of dirt-
 floored "doggie cells." It also involves little or no exercise, no mosquito nets, no read-
 ing or writing materials for many prisoners, poor nutrition, and inadequate medical
 care. A handful of prominent political prisoners were housed in separate bungalow
 accommodations on the prison compound. Most prisoners were permitted to receive
 medicine as well as supplemental food brought by their families during the 15-
 minute visits permitted every 2 weeks.
 Conditions for political prisoners were reliably reported to be much worse at some
 upcountry prisons. NLD M.P.-elect, U Hla Than, a political prisoner serving a 20-
 year sentence in Insein, died on August 2, after being transferred from the prison
 to Rangoon General Hospital with a terminal illness. His family had sought permis-
 sion to allow him to die at home, but the Government insisted that he renounce his
 mandate as an NLD parliamentarian, a condition that the family and the Party re-
 jected. His family at first understood that Hla Than died of tuberculosis, but later
 the Government said that he had died of AIDS. Responding to foreign journalists
 at a press conference in September, the Government asserted that Ha Than had
 been well-cared for in prison, but that the AIDS diagnosis had only been made in
 July. It is clear that Hla Than did not receive proper medical treatment throughout
 his illness because the Government had made the AIDS diagnosis too late.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-There is no provision in the law for judi-
 cial determination of the legality of detention. The SLORC routinely practiced arbi-
 trary arrest and incommunicado detention. Prior to being charged, detainees rarely
 have access to legal counsel or their families, and political detainees have no oppor-
 tunity to obtain release on bail.
 With the increase in political activism in the wake of Aung San Suu Kyi's release
 from house arrest in July 1995, the number of cases of arbitrary arrest and deten-
 tion increased. The most egregious cases involved the detention during the week of
 May 19 of approximately 260 NLD M.P.'s-elect in conjunction with the Party's May
 26-28 convention. Although all but a few are believed to have been released, elected
 M.P.'s in the group have ben subjected by the SLORC to intense pressure to relin-
 quish their electoral mandates. As of year's end, 25 had done so, primarily as the
 result of threats against their family members or business interests. Again in Sep-
 tember, the SLORC cracked down on the NLD, arresting more than 560 NLD activ-
 ists and supporters to prevent the convening of its first All-Burma Congress. Al-
 though the SLORC claims to have released all those detained, the NLD believes
 that many persons remain in detention. Yet again in December, in the wake of stu-
 dent demonstrations, the SLORC detained more than 200 activists, supporters, and
 others, in addition to at least 263 students whom they had detained and released,
 and whom they accused of aiding and abetting the student protests.
 Authorities confined Aung San Suu Kyi to her compoundfrom December 6 to De-
 cember 29. Since mid-December, she has been severely restricted in her ability to
 receive visitors.
 The number of NLD members and activists arrested since May 19 and still in de-
 tention at the end of the year totaled at least 147, including at least 17 M.P.'s-elect.
 None of those arrested can reasonably be considered to have engaged in activities
 violently threatening to the State. U Win Htein, AungSan Suu Kyi's personal sec-
 retary, was arrested in June (along with two other NLD activists) and sentenced
 on August 15 to a 7-year prison term for "knowingly disseminating false informa-
 tion." The charges related to statements made by him on an Australian television
 program earlier in the year. On August 26, he was sentenced to an additional 7
 years for undermining the economy by having assisted in the production of a video-
 tape of rice fields in the Delta region.
 In June, 19 NLD activists-including two M.P.'s-elect from Mandalay-Sagaing,
 and Chin state-were arrested on charges of possessing "subversive" literature on
 passive resistance. The 19 were each sentenced to 7 years in prison.
 The SLORC was prepared to go to considerable lengths in its campaign to harass
 and intimidate the NLD. For example, in March a party benefactor from Mandalay,
 Sein Hla Aung, was sentenced to 3 years' imprisonment for selling videotapes of
 NLD weekend rallies; two comedians from Mandalay, Par Par Lay and Lu Zaw, who
 performed skits critical of the SLORC on the Nobel Laureate's compound, were sen-
 tenced along with two others to 7-years' imprisonment; and Leo Nichols, a friend
 and benefactor of Aung San Suu Kyi, was arrested in April for possessing unauthor-
 ized telephones and a facsimile machine. He received a maximum 3-year sentence,
 suffered a cerebral hemorrhage on June 22 while in custody, and died a few hours
 later in Rangoon General Hospital. The harsh treatment he received in prison al-
 most certainly hastened his death.
 
 
 601
 Forced exile is not used as a method of political control. However, in 1990, when
 the SLORC refused to recognize the results of the elections and pressured successful
 candidates to resign, some of them responded by going into exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is not independent of the executive.
 The SLORC names justices to the Supreme Court who, in turn, appoint lower court
 judges with the approval of the SLORC. Pervasive corruption further serves to un-
 dermine the impartiality of the justice system.
 The court system, as inherited from the United Kingdom and subsequently re-
 structured, comprises courts at the township, district, state, and national levels.
 Throughout the year, the Government continued to rule by decree and was not
 bound by any constitutional provisions guaranteeing fair public trials or any other
 rights. Although remnants of the British-era legal system were formally in place,
 the court system and its operation remained seriously flawed. Particularly in the
 handling of political cases, ongoing unprofessional behavior by some court officials,
 the misuse of overly broad laws, and the manipulation of the courts for political
 ends continued to deprive citizens of the right to a fair trial and the rule of law.
 Some basic due process rights, including the rights to a public trial and to be rep-
 resented by a defense attorney, were generally respected except in sensitive political
 cases. Defense attorneys are permitted to call and cross-examine witnesses, but
 their primary role is to bargain with the judge to obtain the least severe possible
 sentence for their clients. Most court proceedings are open to the public. However,
 in political cases, trials are held in courtrooms located in prison compounds and are
 not open to the public. In these instances, defense counsel appears to serve no other
 purpose than to provide moral support, since reliable reports indicate that verdicts
 are dictated by higher authorities. In the case of Win Htein, defense counsel was
 prevented from attending his trials because the authorities withheld permission.
 In contrast with past years, there have been virtually no publicly announced re-
 leases of prisoners believed to be held for political reasons. To date, only one such
 announcement involving four persons appeared in the press. At year's end, at least
 several hundred-if not many more-political prisoners remained incarcerated.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, and Correspondence.-Mili-
 tary authorities ruled unchecked by any outside authority, and the State continued
 to interfere extensively and arbitrarily with the lives of private citizens. Through
 its extensive intelligence network, the Government closely monitored the travel,
 whereabouts, and activities of many citizens, particularly those believed to be politi-
 cally active. Security personnel selectively screened private correspondence and tele-
 phone calls and conducted warrantless searches of private premises. At times the
 Government attempted to jam foreign radio broadcasts, and private citizens were
 generally unable to subscribe directly to foreign publications (see Section 2.a.). Gov-
 ernment employees were required to obtain advance permission before meeting with
 foreigners.
 The SLORC continued to move citizens out of cities to peripheral new town settle-
 ments, though not on the same scale as in the early 1990's. While facilities in some
 of these areas have improved over time, residents targeted for displacement contin-
 ued to be given no option but to move, usually on short notice. In Hlaing Thaya
 township near Rangoon, residents were relocated again after having been moved in
 1992. The military forces also continued to relocate by force hundreds of rural vil-
 lages, especially in ethnic minority areas. Approximately 30,000 Karenni were dis-
 placed, as were tens of thousands of Shan villagers.
 Those in established cities and towns were subject to arbitrary seizure of their
 property. In a number of urban areas, residents were compelled to cede land for
 road-widening projects decided upon without anypublic consultation nor endorse-
 ment. Other long-term city residents were required to cede land for commercial re-
 development and were compensated at only a fraction of the value of their lost
 homes. In rural areas, military personnel at times confiscated livestock and food
 supplies. Even the resting places of the dead were not spared as the Government
 took over several cemeteries for development and gave families only a few weeks
 to relocate their ancestors' remains.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-For more than    four decades the army has battled diverse ethnic
 insurgencies. These ethnic minority insurgent groups have sought to gain greater
 autonomy from the dominant ethnic Burman majority. In 1989 the SLORC began
 a policy of seeking cease-fire agreements with most ethnic insurgent groups along
 the borders. In late 1995, government troops attempted to move into arenni-held
 areas of Kayah state, leading to the breakdown of the cease-fire with the Karenni
 National Progressive Party (KNPP) that the SLORC had negotiated in June 1995.
 In January the army began an offensive against the KNPP, which continued
 throughout the year. In June the military forcibly relocated 96 Karenni villages hav-
 
 
 ing an estimated population of 20,000 to 30,000 as part of its campaign to deny the
 guerrillas local support. Also in January, the SLORC negotiated a cease-fire with
 alleged drug trafficker Khun Sa and his Mong Tai Army. Although the cease-fire
 succeeded in breaking up the majority of Khun Sa's forces, dissident elements con-
 tinued to fight the Government, which prompted a campaign of relocation against
 the Shan people. As many as 50,000 persons may have been forced to move from
 their villages.
 In conjunction with the military's campaigns against the Karen, Karenni, and the
 remnants of Khun Sa's Mong Tai Army, it was standard practice for the military
 authorities to coerce thousands of civilians living in jungle areas in or near combat
 zones into working as porters. There were also many reports that soldiers raped fe-
 male members of ethnic minorities. In the regions controlled by insurgent groups
 involved in the illegal narcotics trade, civilians were reliably reported to have been
 subjected by the army to forced labor as well.
 Antigovernment insurgent groups were also responsible for violence, including the
 use of mines, causing both civilian and military deaths.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government continued to impose severe re-
 strictions on freedom of speech and the press. The security services continued to re-
 ress those attempting to express opposition political views, and many more re-
 frained from speaking out for fear of arrest and interrogation. The major exceptions
 were Aung San Suu Kyi and NLD vice-chairmen Tin Oo and Kyi Maung, who gave
 speeches every weekend in front of Aung San Suu Kyi's residence to those willing
 to risk being detained by military intelligence authorities. However, in September
 the authorities prohibited the weekend speeches as part of the Government's cam-
 paign to prevent the NLD from holding its Party Congress. The barriers in front
 of Aung San Suu Kyi's house remained in place, and the weekend speeches were
 barred at year's end.
 All forms of domestic public media were officially controlled and/or censored. This
 strict control in turn encouraged self-censorship on the part of writers and publish-
 ers. Private citizens were generally unable to subscribe directly to foreign publica-
 tions, but a limited selection of foreign newspapers could be purchased in a few ho-
 tels in Rangoon. A limited supply of secondhand copies of international news maga-
 zines and a sizable number of private publications on nonpolitical issues were avail-
 able to the public, but censors frequently banned issues or deleted articles deemed
 unwelcome by the Government.
 The government-monopoly television, radio, and newspaper media remained prop-
 aganda instruments. With the exception of reporting on some limited aspects of the
 National Convention, these official media did not report opposing views except to
 criticize them. Editors remained answerable to military authorities. While the Eng-
 lish-language daily New Light of Myanmar continued to include many international
 wire service reports of foreign news, domestic news hewed strictly to and reinforced
 government policy.
 Many foreign journalists, including television crews, were able to visit and report
 on developments though the Government sometimes restricted and monitored their
 movements. At die same time, it denied visas to other journalists, or their issuance
 was so delayed as to render a planned visit impossible. It harassed journalists dur-
 ing the abortive September NLD Party Congress and subsequently during student
 demonstrations.
 Foreign radio broadcasts, such as those of the British Broadcasting Corporation,
 Voice of America, and Norway-based Democratic Voice of Burma, remained prime
 sources of uncensored information. The authorities at times attempted to jam or oth-
 erwise interfere with the reception of these broadcasts (see Section 1.f.). The Gov-
 ernment allowed some official foreign news services to conduct a range of programs.
 The authorities continued to restrict the reception of satellite television broad-
 casts. Penalties of up to 3 years' imprisonment for operation of an unlicensed sat-
 ellite television receiver can be imposed. Licenses, however, were almost impossible
 to obtain by ordinary citizens.
 During the year, the Government issued a series of Orwellian decrees designed
 to strengthen its control over all forms of political expression and its citizens' access
 to information. In June the SLORC issued Order 5/96, which prohibited speeches
 or statements that "undermine national stability" as well as the drafting of alter-
 native constitutions. In July the Government amended the television and video law
 to impose additional restrictions and stiffer penalties on the distribution of video-
 tapes not approved by the censor. In September the Government decreed that all
 privately owned computers, software, and associated telecommunications devices
 
 
 603
 would be subject to government registration. The law required government permls-
 sion for all communications by computer.
 University teachers and professors remained subject to the same restrictions on
 freedom of speech, political activities, and publications as other government employ-
 ees. These included warnings against criticism of the Government; instructions not
 to discuss politics while at work; and strictures against joining or supporting politi-
 cal parties, engaging in political activity, or meeting foreigners. Teachers continued
 to be held responsible for propagating SLORC political goals among their students
 and for maintaining discipline and preventing students from engaging in any unau-
 thorized political activity.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government does not re-
 spect these rights. The Government's prohibition on unauthorized outdoor assem-
 blies of more than 5 people remained in effect, albeit unevenly enforced. For exam-
 ple, 3,000 to 4,000 persons regularly gathered in front of Aung San Suu Kyi's resi-
 dence to listen to her speak at weekly talks until authorities stopped the speeches
 in September. At the time when the Government prevented the "NLD Congress, it
 also erected barricades at her residence and imposed additional restrictions on her
 freedom to leave the premises. Aung San Sun Ky has been unable to speak to the
 public since September, except briefly on two occasions.
 The Government curtailed student demonstrations in December. It did, however,
 permit students to demonstrate for several days early in the month. Riot police
 eventually curtailed the demonstrations, using water cannons and batons. Aftr de-
 taining and releasing hundreds of students, the Government closed the universities
 to prevent further demonstrations.
 Legal political parties remained formally required to renest permission from the
 authorities to hold internal meetings of their members, although some members still
 met without official permission. These persons like those attending Aung San Sun
 Kyi's addresses, remained iable to arrest for thxese activities. In the NLDs attempt
 to hold a Party Congress, the authorities temporarily detained hundreds of support-
 ers; several dozen remain in jail. The Government's own mass mobilization organi-
 zation, the Union Solidarity and Development Association (USDA), continued to
 hold large-scale rallies in support of government policies. In many cases, it coerced
 attendance, using explicit threats of penalties for those who contemplated staying
 away. Religious groups, by contrast, sometimes encountered problems holding out-
 door gatherings.
 Aside from officially sanctioned organizations such as the USDA, the right of asso-
 ciation existed only for the few organizations, such as trade associations and profes-
 sional bodies, permitted by law and duly registered with the Government. Only a
 handful continued to exist, and even those were subject to direct government inter-
 vention or took special care to act in accordance with government policy. This in-
 cluded such benign organizations as the Myanmar Red Cross and the Myanmar
 Medical Association.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Adherents of all religions that were duly registered with
 the authorities generally enjoyed freedom to worship as they chose,  though Bud-
 dhists continued to enjoy a privileged position. In recent years, the Government
 made special efforts to link itself with Buddhism as a means of asserting its own
 popular legitimacy. For example, the SLORC continued its construction of two pago-
 das to house a venerated Buddha tooth relic from China, which is expected to be
 available for loan for periodic visits. The SLORC also renovated the Shwedagon Pa-
 goda to commemorate its eighth anniversary in power.
 The Government monitored the activities of members of all religions, in part be-
 cause such members have, in the past, become politically active. The Muslim and
 Christian religious minorities continued to be regarded with suspicion by authori-
 ties. Moreover, there is a concentration of Christians among the particular ethnic
 minorities against whom the army has fought for decades. Religious publications,
 like secular ones, remained subject to control and censorship. Christian bibles trans-
 lated into indigenous languages could not legally be imported or printed. It re-
 mained extremely difficult for Christian and Muslim groups to obtain permission to
 build new churches and mosques. There were credible reports of incidents in which
 the Government removed cemeteries in constructing infrastructure projects in urban
 areas. In December the Government ordered the removal of Christian, Chinese, and
 Buddhist graves from the Kyandaw Cemetery in Rangoon to make way for a
 planned real estate development.
 Religious groups have established links with coreligionists in other countries, al-
 though these activities were reportedly monitored by the Government. Foreign reli-
 gious representatives were usually allowed visas only for short stays but in some
 cases were permitted to preach to congregations. Permanent foreign missionary es-
 tablishments have not been permitted since the 1960's, but seven Catholic nuns and
 
 
 604
 four priests working in Burma since before independence in January 1948, contin-
 ued their work.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Although citizens have the right to live anywhere, both urban and rural
 residents were subject to arbitrary relocation (see Section 1.f.). Except for limita-
 tions in areas of insurgent activity, citizens could travel freely within the country
 but were required to notify local authorities of their whereabouts. Those residents
 unable to meet the restrictive provisions of the citizenship law (e.g., Chinese,
 Arakanese Muslims, etc.), were required to obtain prior permission to travel.
 The Government carefully scrutinized all prospective travel abroad, and rampant
 corruption resulted in many applicants havin to pay bribes to obtain passports to
 which they were legally entitled. The official board that reviews passport applica-
 tions denied passports in some cases on apparent political grounds. In January the
 Government began restricting the issuance of passports to young female applicants
 seeking work abroad. The new procedures are reportedly intended to prevent young
 women from being enticed to travel abroad to jobs that in fact are in the commercial
 sex industry. All college graduates obtaining a passport (except for certain govern-
 ment employees) were required to pay a special education clearance fee to reimburse
 the Government. Citizens who emigrated legally were generally allowed to return
 to visit relatives. Even some citizens who had lived abroad illegally and acquired
 foreign citizenship were able to return to visit.
 In anticipation of the Government'splanned "Visit Myanmar Year 1996," restric-
 tions on foreign travelers were eased. Burmese embassies issued tourist visas, valid
 for 1 month, within 24 hours of application. However, select categories of applicants
 such as some human rights advocates and political figures, continued to be denied
 entry visas unless traveling under the aegis of a sponsor acceptable to the Govern-
 ment. Although some areas of the country remained off-limits to foreigners for secu-
 rity reasons, the authorities allowed travel to most destinations.
 In 1996 approximately 23,000 of the Rohingya Muslims who fled to Bangladesh
 in 1992 returned to Burma, bringing the total number of returnees to about
 220,000. In comparison with 1995, the pace of repatriation slowed, with over 30,000
 still in camps across the border at yeas end. The U.N. High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees reported that the authorities cooperated in investigating the isolated incidents
 of renewed abuse that were reported. However, returnees complained of restrictions
 imposed by the Government on their ability to travel and to engage in economic ac-
 tivity. Since February an estimated 10,000 new asylum seekers entered Bangladesh
 to escape economic hardship and the abusive regime.
 The Government does not allow refugees or displaced persons from abroad to re-
 settle or seek safe haven. The Government has not formulated a policy concerning
 refugees, asylees, or first asylum, and it is not a party to the 1951UM. Convention
 or its 1967 protocol relating to the status of refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Despite the overwhelming desire that citizens demonstrated in the 1990 elections
 for a return to democracy, they continued to be denied the right to change their gov-
 ernment. Despite the appointment of several civilians to the Cabinet in 1992, the
 process of placing military or recently retired military officers in most key senior
 level positions in the economic ministries has continued.
 Following the NLDs victory in the 1990 elections, the SLORC set aside the elec-
 tion results and disqualified, detained, arrested, or drove into exile many successful
 candidates. Since then, 216 of the 485 Deputies elected have either been disquali-
 fied, resigned under pressure, gone into exile, been detained, or died. An estimated
 28 successful candidates from the election remain in prison.
 Rather than accept the will of the citizenry, the SLORC convened a National Con-
 vention in January 1993 to draw up principles for a new constitution. The SLORC
 handpicked most delegates and carefully orchestrated the proceedings; even limited
 opposition views were ignored. Despite having no mandate from the people, the
 SLORC tasked the Convention with drafting principles for a new constitution de-
 signed to provide a dominant role for the military services in the future political
 structure. Representatives of the SLORC leadership met with prodemocracy leader
 Aung San Suu Kyi on two occasions in late 1994, but did not engage in a genuine
 dialog on the country's political future. It instead proceeded with its own controlled
 "consultations" on a new constitution. In November 1995, the NLD delegates with-
 drew from the Convention pending agreement by the authorities to discuss revising
 the Convention's working procedurs. Two days later they were formally expell
 The National Convention continued its deliberations until it adjourned in March.
 The specific provisions adopted to date were designed to ensure the major involve-
 
 
 ment of the military services in all levels of government-to the point of reserving
 25 percent of seats in the Parliament to appointed, rather than elected, members
 of the military services. In addition, provisions have been adopted prohibiting,
 among other things, anyone "under acknowledgement of allegiance" to a foreigner
 or who has received any type of assistance from a foreign source, from participating
 in the Government. These provisions are apparently designed to exclude Aung San
 Suu Kyi who is married to an Englishman and who won the Nobel Peace Prize in
 1991.
 Women and minorities are underrepresented in the top ranks of government serv-
 ice and excluded from military leadership. Members of certain minority groups con-
 tinue to be denied full citizenship (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not allow domestic human rights organizations to exist, and
 it remained generally hostile to outside scrutiny of its human rights record. During
 1995 the U.N. Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) adopted a resolution severely
 criticizing the Government for the human rights situation. The resolution was based
 on a report by Professor Yozo Yokota, the UNHRC's Special Rapporteur for Burma.
 The Burmese representative at the Commission in turn rejected the criticism as "in-
 accurate, intrusive, and politically motivated." In keeping with the Special
 Rapporteur's mandate, in October 1995, the Government permitted Professor Yokota
 to undertake another survey trip to Burma, after which he delivered a highy criti-
 cal review of the human rights situation to the U.N. General Assembly's Third Com-
 mittee. In December 1995, the U.. General Assembly adopted another consensus
 resolution deploring the continued violation of human rights in Burma. Upset by
 this severe criticism, the authorities refused to meet with UNHRC representatives
 during 1996. The UNHRC Commissioner, Jose Ayala Lasso, and the new Special
 Rapporteur for Burma, Rajsoomer Lallah, tried unsuccessfully to arrange visits.
 Approximately  12 nonpolitical international nongovermental organizations
 (NGO's) continued project work, while a few more established a provisional presence
 while undertaking the protracted negotiations necessary to set up permanent oper-
 ations in the country.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Government continued to rule by decree and was not bound by any constitu-
 tional provisions concerning discrimination.
 Women.-Violence against women, including spousal abuse, is infrequent. Married
 couples often do not live by themselves but rather in households with extended fam-
 ilies, where social pressure tends to protect the wife from abuse. Trafficking in
 women and girls remains a serious problem. There were reliable reports that many
 women and children in border areas, where the Goernment's control is limited,
 were forced or lured into working as prostitutes in Thailand. It is unknown how
 many young women have been deceived into working as prostitutes, but a common
 practice is to lure young women to Thailand with promises of employment as a wait-
 ress or domestic servant (see country report for Thailand). In addition, the military
 forces continued to impress women for military porterage duties, and there were
 many reports of rape of ethnic minority women by soldiers (see Sections 1.c. and
 1.g.).
 In general women have traditionally enjoyed a high status, exercising most of the
 same basic rights as men and taking an active role in business. Consistent with tra-
 ditional culture, they keep their own names after marriage and often control family
 finances. However, women remained underrepresented in most traditionally male
 occupations, and a few professions continued to be entirely barred to women. The
 burden of poverty, which is particularly widespread in rural areas, fell dispropor-
 tionately on women.
 Women did not consistently receive equal pay for equal work. There were no inde-
 pendent women's rights organizations, and no government ministry was specifically
 charged with safeguarding women's interests. The Myanmar Maternal and Child
 Welfare Association, a government-controlled agency, provided assistance to moth-
 ers. A professional society for businesswomen, the Myanmar Women Entrepreneurs'
 Association, formed in 1995, provided loans to new businesses.
 Children.-Despite the establishment of various child welfare programs, the Gov-
 ernment allocated little funding to programs that aid children. According to govern-
 ment data, education's share of central government operating expenditures contin-
 ued its decline to 12 percent in 1994-95, the latest year for which such data was
 available, Although education is compulsory, almost 40 percent of children never at-
 
 
 606
 tend school, and almost three-fourths fail to complete 5 years of primary education.
 Child prostitution of young females forced or lured into the commercial sex trade
 in Thailand continued to be a major problem. The rising incidence of HIV infection
 has increased the demand for supposedly "safer" younger women.
 People With Disabilities.-Official assistance to persons with disabilities is ex-
 tremely limited. There is no law mandating accessibility to buildings, government
 facilities, or public transportation. While several small-scale organizations have pro-
 grams to assist the disabled, most disabled persons must rely on traditional family
 structures to provide for their welfare. Disabled veterans receive available benefits
 on a priority basis. Because of land mine detonations, Burma has a very high rate
 of amputee injuries.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Burma's myriad ethnic minorities have long
 resented the dominance of the Burman majority. Members of these minorities,
 largely excluded from the military leadership, have been underrepresented in the
 Government. Over the last few years and continuing in 1996, the SLORC, in the
 name of national solidarity sought to pacify ethnic groups by means of negotiated
 cease-fires, grants of limited autonomy, and promises of development assistance.
 The Government included a large number of ethnic minority representatives in
 the National Convention and permitted extended debate on the issue of minority au-
 tonomy. However, the ethnic minority populations complained that their concerns
 have not been addressed adequately by the Government, and none is satisfied with
 the provisions on limited "self-administration," which the authorities plan to accord
 to a few groups under the new constitution.
 Government investment in the border areas in road, hospital, and school construc-
 tion has been modest, and economic development among minorities continued to lag,
 leaving many living at barely subsistence levels. Since the focus of the hostilities
 against armed insurgencies has been in the border areas where most minorities are
 concentrated, those populations have been disproportionately victimized by the gen-
 eral brutalization associated with the military forces' activities.,
 Since only people who can prove long familial links to Burma are accorded full
 citizenship, ethnic populations such as Muslims, Indians, and Chinese, continued to
 be deniedfull citizenship and to be excluded from government positions. People
 without full citizenship are not free to travel domestically and are barred from cer-
 tain advanced university programs in medicine and technological fields. Anti-Chi-
 nese and anti-Muslim sentiment remained pervasive.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Free trade unions do not exist, and even former gov-
 ernment-controlled ones were dormant. Workers continued to be unable to strike.
 There were no reported instances in which workers attempted to strike, although
 there was an unconfirmed report that workers in a government jute factory on occa-
 sion failed to come to work. In July 1989, the United States suspended Burma's eli-
 gibility for trade concessions under the Generalized System of Preferences program,
 pending steps to afford its labor force internationally recognized worker rights.
 Because of its longstanding violation of International Labor Organization (ILO)
 Convention 87 on Freedom of Association, the Government received unusually harsh
 criticism at the ILO Conference in June where the Committee on the Application
 of Standards devoted a "special paragraph" to Burma in its General Report. This
 action followed the last minute cancellation in May of a visit by a high-level ILO
 technical assistance mission while it was en route to Rangoon at the invitation of
 the Government.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers do not have the
 right to organize and bargain collectively to set wages and benefits. The Govern-
 ment's Central Arbitration Board, which theoretically provides a means for settling
 major labor disputes, nominally continued to exist, but in practice was dormant.
 Township-level labor supervisory committees remained in place to address various
 minor labor concerns.
 The Government unilaterally sets wages in the public sector. In the private sector,
 wages are set by market forces. The Government pressures joint ventures not to pay
 salaries greater than those of ministers or other senior employees. Joint ventures
 circumvent this with supplemental pay, including remuneration paid in foreign ex-
 change certificates, as well as through incentive and overtime pay and other fringe
 benefits. Foreign firms generally set wages near those of the domestic private sector
 but follow the example of joint ventures in awarding supplemental wages and bene-
 fits.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-In September, following an inves-
 tigation of the country's forced labor practices, the European Union Commission pro-
 
 
 posed to withdraw benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences. In recent
 years, the Government has increasingly supplemented declining investment with
 uncompensated people's "contributions, chiefly of forced labor, to build or maintain
 irrigation, transportation, and tourism infrastructure projects.
 The army continued to force citizens to work as porters, which led to mistreat-
 ment, illness, and death. Citizens, including women and children, were forced to
 labor under harsh working conditions on construction projects throughout the coun-
 try (see Sections 1.c. and 1.g.).
 The Government's statistics on these contributions and infrastructure projects
 suggest that the market value of these uncompensated "contributions" has increased
 since 1992. According to the Prison Department exhibit in the Defense Services Mu-
 seum in Rangoon, the quantity of stone quarried by prisoners increased more than
 fourfold between fiscal year 1988/89 and fiscal year 1994/95.
 In June 1995, the Government issued a directive prohibiting unpaid labor in na-
 tional government projects. In June 1996, the Government introduced an initiative
 to use military personnel for infrastructure projects. The scale of these initiatives
 and their impact on the use of civilian forced labor have yet to be determined. None-
 theless, there were credible reports that forced labor continued in a variety of
 projects throughout the country.
 During 1996 there were repeated allegations that forced labor was used in a
 project to build a pipeline across the Tenasserim Division. The preponderance of evi-
 dence indicates that the pipeline project has paid its workers at least a market
 wage.
 In June 1995, the ILO Conference Committee on the Application of Standards
 cited Burma in a second special paragraph for its violation of ILO Convention 29
 on forced labor. In November of this year, the governing board of the ILO took ac-
 tion on an Article 26 complaint, accusing the Government of systematic use of forced
 labor, which could eventually lead to the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry
 on the problem.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Although the law sets a minimum
 age of 13 years or the employment of children, in practice the law is not enforced.
 Working children are highly visible in cities, mostly working for small or family en-
 terprises. Children are hired at lower pay rates than are adults for the same kind
 of work, and economic pressure forces children to work not only for their survival
 but also to support their families. Arts and crafts is the only sector producing for
 the export market that employs a significant number of children. Despite a compul-
 sory education law, almost 40 percent of children never enroll in school, and only
 27 percent complete the 5-year primary school course.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Surplus labor conditions and lack of protection
 by government authorities continue to dictate substandard conditions for workers,
 despite recent annual economic growth of at least 5 percent. The Law on Fundamen-
 tal Workers Rights of 1964 and the Factories Act of 1951 regulate working condi-
 tions. There is a legally prescribed 5-day, 35-hour workweek for employees in the
 public sector and a 6-day, 44-hour workweek for private and public sector employ-
 ees, with overtime paid for additional work. The law' also allows for a 24-hour rest
 period per week, and workers have 21 paid holidays a year. Such provisions actually
 affect only a small portion of the countrys labor force.
 Only government employees and employees of a few traditional industries are cov-
 ered by minimum wage provisions. The minimum monthly wage for salaried public
 employees is $3.75 (600 kyat), but this sum is supplemented by various subsidies
 and allowances. The low level of pay in public employment fostered widespread cor-
 ruption. The government minimum wage for day labor is $0.12 (20 kyat). The mini-
 mum wage does not a provide a worker and family with a decent standard of living.
 Workers in the private sector are much better paid. The actual average wage rate
 for casual laborers in Rangoon was six times the official minimum. Wage increases
 continued to lag far behindinflation.
 Numerous health and safety regulations exist, but in practice the Government has
 not made the necessary resources available to those charged with their enforcement.
 Although workers may in principle remove themselves from hazardous conditions,
 in practice workers cannot expect to retain their jobs if they do so.
