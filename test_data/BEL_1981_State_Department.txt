 BELGIUM
 Belgium has shared in the major philosophical, political and
 social trends of Western European history over the last several
 centuries and is a stable democratic society committed to human
 rights and political freedoms. It is a parliamentary democracy
 under a constitutional monarchs the council of ministers
 (Cabinet) in practice is responsible for governmental
 decisions. The council, led by the prime minister, holds
 office as long as it retains the confidence of the Parliament.
 Direct popular elections for parliamentary seats (excluding 76
 of the 182 Senate seats apportioned by other means) are held at
 least every four years under a system of universal suffrage,
 obligatory voting and a form of proportional representation.
 Belgium is a party to the 1950 European Convention of the
 Protection of Suman Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Political
 freedoms and guarantees of individual rights are embodied in
 the constitution and laws,.and observed in practice.
 Educational levels are high, as is public involvement in the
 governmental process. The government is committed to continue
 a policy of social benefits and equitable distribution of
 economic gains in this materially prosperous country.
 Belgium is scrupulous in observing internationally recognized
 human rights and has a legal and cultural tradition of respect
 and concern for those rights.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person. Including Freedom
 froms
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Torture is not specifically addressed in the Belgian
 constitution, which provides that 'no person may be prosecuted
 except in cases laid down by the law and in the form it
 prescribes* (article 7) and *no penalty may be decreed nor
 applied save in accordance with the law" (Article 9). The
 various provisions of the Belgian penal code which declare
 unlawful and subject to penalty the deliberate mistreatment or
 injury of another are applicable to the actions of officials as
 well as those of private individuals.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is
 guaranteed by law and is respected in practice. There are no
 differences in the conditions of confinement based on race,
 sex, religion or social class. Persons convicted of nonviolent
 crimes are, however, often assigned to minimum security
 facilities.
 c. Disappearances
 Abduction, secret atrests or clandestine detentions by official
 or quasi-official security forces or othqr officially condoned
 elements contravene Belgian law and are unknown in practice.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment is guaranteed by
 law and respected in practice. Arrested persons must be
 brought before a judge within 24 hours or released. Belgian
 law provides for pre-trial confinement only under special
 circumstances: when a person is apprehended in the commission
 of a criminal act; when there is a risk that the suspect will
 prove a danger to the community, when there is a risk that he
 will flee the jurisdiction; and in cases involving a number of
 serious offenses specified by law. The justification for such
 confinement is subject to periodic review by a panel of judges.
 a. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial, including the right to counsel, is
 guaranteed by law and honored in practice. A suspect is
 charged, if the evidence so warrants, when the preliminary
 judicial investigatory phase is completed. Charges are clearly
 and formally stated. A civilian may not be tried within
 Belgium by military courts; however, civilian dependents
 accompanying Belgian forces stationed outside the country are
 subject to the code of military justice and can be tried by
 military courts.
 f. Invasion of the Rome
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. The inviolability of the home is
 specifically guaranteed by article 10 of the Belgian
 constitution, except in cases laid down and regulated by law.
 The law forbids searches of private homes at night except in
 special circumstances; warrants issued by a judge are required
 unless the inhabitants of the domicile agree to the search.
 The penal code provides penalties for all violations of the
 home by officials as well as by private persons.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Varying political, religious, philosophical and
 artistic views are permitted free public expression, and there
 is no political censorship of the media. There are, however,
 'prohibitions on publications and productions held to undermine
 *public order" (e.g. pornography and incitement of violence).
 There are laws against libel and provisions for a citizen's
 right of reply to criticism and restrictions on criticism of
 government policies by civil servants. Belgium has a
 state-owned radio and television network, but there is no
 direct government control of program content. Programs are
 supervised by boards of directors which represent the main
 currents of opinion. The government has a representative on
 the boards but no veto power.
 
 
 Subject to regulations of public order, political, civic,
 religious, artistic, social and special interest groups are
 permitted free public assembly. Labor unions and professional
 groups are totally free from harassment and persecution. The
 Christian, Jewish amd Moslem religions are accorded a
 "recognized* status in law which entails a government subsidy.
 Minority "non-recognized" religions enjoy full freedom to
 practice and are not subject to harassment or persecution.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Belgian citizens enjoy freedom of travel within the
 country and internationally, including the right of voluntary
 repatriation. Within a system of immigration and labor
 regulations, Belgium previously admitted a large number of
 foreign immigrants. The granting of resident status to
 non-European Community nationals has become more restrictive in
 recent years due to domestic unemployment. As a general
 practice, Belgium grants asylum to those foreign nationals
 applying in Belgium who are recommended by the local office of
 the UM High Commissioner for Refugees as eligible for asylum.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Participation in the political system is open to all citizens.
 Suffrage is universal for all adults (18 or over), secret and
 compulsory. Unweighted voting (one person/one vote) has been
 in effect since 1919 and women's suffrage since 1948. Women
 are legally equal to men and participate freely in political as
 well as social and economic life, and the number active in
 these areas is growing. In the current parliament 12 out of
 212 house seats and 21 out of 182 senate seats are held by
 women. Four out of 25 cabinet level positions are filled by
 women. There are 12 parties currently represented in the
 Belgian parliament. Opposition parties are free under law and
 in practice to operate without constraints or repression.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Belgian Government's willingness and past record regarding
 independent investigation of alleged human rights violations is
 exemplary. Specifically, the Belgian ministry of foreign
 affairs in January 1979 circulated in the United Nations a
 proposal that countries should waive voluntarily the right,
 conferred on them by article 6(B) of resolution 1503, not to
 consent to the carrying out of an investigation concerning
 human rights. No requests have been made for outside
 investigation of the human rights situation in Belgium.

 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 .Belgium is an affluent country. Its per capita GNP in 1981 was
 ,about $11,000. The government is committed to policies ensuring
 that these benefits are distributed equitably throughout the
 'economy. The adverse effects of a general downturn in the
 world economy, combined with structural problems in the
 national economy, have led to a high unemployment rate, which
 is being confronted by government remedial policies and by an
 extensive system-of unemployment compensation and other social
 benefits which, in most cases, prevents serious individual
 hardship.
 Belgium is a healthy country, its population enjoying a life
 expectancy at birth of 72 years. The infant mortality rate is
 only 12 per 1,000 live births. Its population is growing at
 0.2 per.cent per year (1970-79). Its population is almost
 totally literate, and its adjusted primary school enrollment
 rate for both sexes exceeds 100 percent.
 A common public educational system serves all economic levels.
 Belgium's tax system redounds to the advantage of the
 zelatively poorer classes. Women in Belgium hold many
 .positions of distinction, power and importance in areas such as
 politics, business, science, medicine and the arts. As a rule,
 however, women occupy lower paying positions. Foreign workers,
 both male and :female, who usually perform menial functions,
 .usually earn the lowest wages and fill the socially less
 desirable.jobs. Belgium hasprovided the basic legal
 ï¿½guarantees..and the benefits of its extensive social security
 .system to many foreign workers.
 To confront the long-standing problem of linguistic division
 between the. Flemish-speaking north and the French-speaking
 south, .detailed provisions have been made in law and government
 structure to assure equitable participation in the national
 life for both major linguistic groups. A long-term solution to
 the linguistic community problems remains the priority goal of
 'the government, and new legislation to this end was enacted in
 1980. Implementing legislation is expected in 1982.
