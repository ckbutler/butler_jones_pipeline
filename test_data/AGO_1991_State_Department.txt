 ANGOLA*
 
 During the first part of 1991, the Government of the People's
 Republic of Angola (GPRA) remained under the control of the
 sole legal political party, the'Popular Movement for the
 Liberation of Angola-Workers Party (MPLA-PT). President Jose
 Eduardo dos Santos continued to act as both Head of State and
 chief of the MPLA-PT.. All major policy decisions were taken by
 a small group within the party, which also controlled all means
 of mass communication.
 The 16-year aimed conflict between the GPRA and the armed
 opposition, the National Union for the Total Independence of
 Angola (UNITA), also continued in early 1991. UNITA remained.
 in control of the southeastern quarter of Angola and portions
 of the north, and increased its activity in central Angola.
 Heavy fighting erupted around the eastern provincial capital of
 Luena in early April and continued until the cease--fire on May
 15, resulting in heavy civilian casualties and the flight of
 large numbers of additional refugees to Zambia. According to
 the United Nations, the last of the Cuban troops who remained
 in Angola in support of FAPLA departed on May 27. more than a
 month before the deadline specified in the New York Accords of
 December 22, 1988.
 In 1991, two related major events significantly altered the
 political and military situation in Angola.' While the
 administration of the GPRA remained'under the contrbl of the
 MPLA, constitutional reforms were enacted in May in the wake of
 the peace negotiations with UNITA, paving the way for future
 multiparty, democratic government. The revised 1991
 Constitution contains provisions for the formation of
 independent political parties and guarantees of freedom of the
 press, the right of free assembly, and the right of workers to
 strike. Subsequent laws provided the legal framework for these
 new provisions.
 On May 31, the GPRA and UNITA signed the Angola Peace Accords,
 which provide for a comprehensive U.N.-monitored cease-fire,
 the release of prisoners (POW's), the formation of a new
 nonpartisan national armed force, and the holding of
 internationally monitored multiparty elections between
 September 1 and November 30, 1992. Under the terms of the
 Accords, until elections the GPRA will retain control of the
 central administration which is being extended to areas
 currently under the control of UNITA. Implementation of the
 Peace Accords is under the authority of the Joint Political
 Military Commission (JPMC) and its subcommissions.
 Angola is potentially one of the richest countries in
 sub-Saharan Africa, with extensive petroleum reserves, rich
 agricultural land, and valuable mineral resources. The civil
 war, combined with the GPRA's command-style economy, has
 devastated the country's infrastructure, led to a return to
 barter in many areas, and forced the GPRA to divert much of its
 revenues; mainly from oil exports, to the military and to
 state-owned enterprises. Expressing a willingness to reform
 the economy, the GPRA in 1991 instituted a series of reforms
 *The United States does not recognize or maintain diplomatic
 relations with the People's Republic of Angola; while it
 maintains a liaison office in Luanda accredited to the Joint
 Political Military Commission overseeing implementation of the
 May 31, 1991, Peace Accords, access to information on the human
 rights situation in Angola continues to be limited.

 for that purpose, including three devaluations of the currency,
 decontrol of prices on most commodities, and an end to the
 special and complementary supply system. However, serious
 action has yet to be taken on other economic issues, including
 reduction of the size of the public sector and the the shift of
 public expenditure from military to civilian needs.
 The civil war has also taken a devastating toll on the civilian
 population. Estimates of victims since the war began in 1976
 range from 250,000 to 500,000 killed, more than 20,000 children
 orphaned, 30,000 to 50,000 amputees caused by land mines, and
 430,000 refugees. Throughout the war, widespread human rights
 abuses were reported by both sides, ranging from extensive
 violence against civilians and mistreatment of prisoners to
 arbitrary detentions, absence of fair trials, kidnaping and
 forced military service, forced relocation, and restrictions on
 freedom of speech, press, and association. At the beginning of
 1991, a 3-month suspension by the GPRA of a U.N.-sponsored
 famine relief program further endangered the estimated 1.9
 million civilians affected by conflict and drought.
 At the end of 1991, human rights continued to be
 circumscribed. UNITA alleged that civilian security forces
 continued to intimidate its supporters and that the GPRA was
 using its control of the administration to influence the
 elections unduly. The GPRA, in turn, accused UNITA of
 targeting MPLA activists for assassination. Emerging parties
 charged that they were being prevented from establishing
 themselves by discriminatory registration procedures and
 intimidation by security forces as well as by UNITA in the
 interior.
 Nevertheless, the Peace Accords produced significant
 improvements in the human rights situation. By year's end,
 there had been no serious violations of the cease-fire.
 According to the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC), all PoW's but two had been released by the GPRA, and
 interviews with and releases of POW's held by UNITA were
 continuing. UNITA and the GPRA were cooperating in
 mine-clearing operations throughout the country. Under the
 auspices of the JPMC, UNITA and the GPRA had agreed on a
 calendar for elections and on programs for integration of the
 police and extension of the GPRA central administration.
 Training for the new national army had begun, and an electoral
 law had been drafted.  While the MPLA retained control of
 government structures and the media, 26 new political parties
 had announced their intention to become established, and
 anti-GPRA propaganda and rallies had occurred without
 interference.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Both GPRA and UNITA forces have in the past carried out
 extrajudicial killings, including summary executions of
 prisoners. Two incidents, one in which UNITA's secretary
 general for Malange province was ambushed and killed in
 September and another in which a UNITA sentry killed a FAPLA
 reserve officer in November, were under review by the JPMC at
 year's end.
 
 
 ANGOLA
 According to GPRA sources, a former UNITA officer hanged
 .himself in Luanda's Catete Road Prison in February; however,
 other sources suggested that torture was the cause of death.
 Press accounts in 1991 repeated earlier allegations that UNITA
 has detained or executed internal opponents of Dr. Jonas
 Savimbi, UNITA's president (see Section l.d.).
 b. Disappearance
 While both GPRA and UNITA forces engaged in kidnapings or
 clandestine detentions in the past, there is no conclusive.
 evidence that either engaged in these practices following the
 cease-fire in May 1991. In 1991 Luis dos Passos, currently
 Secretary General of the Democratic Renewal Party (PRD), and
 another PRD official returned to Luanda. They had been in
 hiding outside Luand since the failed 1977'coup against the
 GPRA in which they were alleged to have participated.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were persistent allegations that the GPRA's State
 Security Service apparatus continued to use torture against
 suspected opponents. Beatings of prisoners and detainees by
 police and prison officials is reportedly common. However, the
 use of torture and other mistreatment of prisoners has
 reportedly declined since the Peace Accords. Released FAPLA
 prisoners have also alleged that beatings, torture, and
 execution were conducted by UNITA.
 The GPRA Ministry of State Security (MkNSE) was formally
 abolished by Presidential decree in December 1990, and many of
 its functions assumed by the Ministry of Interior.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In 1991 the laws on arrest and detention appeared to be in
 transition. In'early 1991, laws remained in force under which
 persons suspected of committing serious acts against "state
 security" could be held for an initial period of 3 months,
 renewable for a further period of 3 months. Such detainees did
 not need to be presented to a judge within 48 hours of their
 arrest, as stipulated in the Code of Criminal Procedures for
 persons suspected of other crimes. They apparently had no
 right to challenge the grounds of their detention. After 6
 months, the State Security Service had to inform the detainee
 and the public prosecutor of the charges or release the
 suspect. Once the case was presented to the public prosecutor,
 there did not appear to be a specific time limit within which a
 suspect must be brought to trial.
 On October 9, the National Assembly approved laws on detention,
 investigation, search, and arrests. However, at the end of the
 year there was no reliable information available on the effect
 of these 'actions and legal provisions, especially on the
 practices of detention without charge and other arrest
 procedures.
 The number of political detainees and criminal and military
 prisoners held by both sides at the end of 1990 was estimated
 in the thousands. On February 5, the GPRA released 3,983
 reportedly UNITA prisoners serving sentences at Bentiaba
 rehabilitation center.
 
 
 ANGOLA
 Under the terms of the Peace Accords, all civilian and military
 prisoners detained as a consequence of the conflict between the
 GPRA and UNITA were to be released under supervision by the
 ICRC. In late July, the first prisoners on each side were
 released. As of December 24, the ICRC had verified that more
 than 900 POW's had been released. Two POW's are known to be
 still held for crimes allegedly committed in prison, including
 murder. As of the same date, the ICRC had registered
 approximately 2,850 FAPLA and GPRA civilian personnel detained
 by UNITA. Of this number, almost all have been released;
 approximately 120 are still awaiting ICRC interview.
 As in previous years, reports citing UNITA's detention of
 internal opponents of UNITA president Savimbi appeared in the
 press in 1991. The emergent Angolan Democratic Forum (FDA)
 party publicly alleged that UNITA "violated and constantly
 violates human rights," citing detention of UNITA members Tito
 Chingungi and Wilson dos Santos, among others. While Chingungi
 was seen alive in the Jamba area in early 1991, his status and
 that of others allegedly detained by UNITA could not be
 independently verified at year's end.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although the GPRA Constitution provides for an independent
 judiciary, the judiciary has in the past followed MPLA-PT party
 guidelines. The law provides for a public trial and the right
 of the accused to legal counsel; the revised Constitution
 provides for the right of habeas corpus. There is, however,
 insufficient information to determine if, or to what extent,
 these rights are observed in practice in regular criminal and
 civil cases.
 The deterioration of the security situation prior to the
 cease-fire exacerbated the general decline in judicial
 safeguards and due process. Judicial lines of authority are
 unclear, especially since the GPRA's regional military councils
 have in the past been given broad responsibility for the trial
 of offenses against "state security," including "economic
 crimes." It is not known which trials are open to the public
 and under what rules of procedure the various military and
 civilian courts operate, nor to what extent the jurisdiction of
 the military councils may in fact have been reduced, as
 planned, following the cease-fire. A Supreme People's Court,
 described by GPRA President dos Santos as a .first practical
 step to an independent judiciary, was established in April
 1990; little information is available on its specific
 functions, but it reportedly handles civil cases only.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Although the Constitution provides for the inviolability of the
 home and privacy of correspondence, the GPRA has in the past
 conducted arbitrary searches of homes, inspected private
 correspondence, and monitored private communications. No
 recent information is available on these practices. UNITA has
 done the same in areas it controlled; UNITA has also forcibly
 occupied buildings in some provincial capitals. In a serious
 incident in December, UNITA supporters forcibly occupied a
 hotel and several other buildings in Lobito; 4 people were
 killed and more than 20 wounded when GPRA police moved in to
 dislodge them. This incident was successfully resolved by
 UNITA and the GPRA within the JPMC.

 ANGOLA
 .g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 During the initial months of 1991, fighting continued in many
 parts of Angola. Intense fighting around the provincial
 capital of Luena during the final few weeks of the civil
 conflict caused civilian casualties in the hundreds. On May
 15, a de facto cease-fire went into effect, followed by a de
 jure cease-fire on May 31. There have been no serious
 violations to date by the military of either side.
 In 1990 it was estimated that between 1 and 1.5 million
 civilians had been internally displaced by the war, many
 hundreds of thousands located in drought-affected areas.
 Credible reports indicate that the GPRA forcibly displaced
 thousands of civilians, in part to deny UNITA a social base,
 and that UNITA captured thousands of civilians and forced them
 to work on UNITA farms. Following an attack on Ambriz in Zaire
 province in early 1991, UNITA reportedly abducted over 100
 local children to deter a FAPLA counterattack. Both sides
 practiced forced conscript-ion of civilians into their
 respective armies--throughout the war. Conscription has been
 discontinued by both sides.
 In September 199G, the GPRA and UNITA agreed to a U.N. relief
 program to provide assistance to affected civilians on both
 sides of the conflict. Amidst mutual recriminations, in
 December 1990 the GPRAcut off the relief program and permitted
 it to resume only. in March 1991. The program has been extended
 until the end of 1992.
 The GPRA and UNITA placed thousands of land mines in footpaths
 to agricultural fields during the civil war as part of a
 strategy to deny food to civilians in contested areas. Good
 cooperation between both sides on land mine removal has been
 reported since the cease-fire; however, rural roads and fields
 remain hazardous.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech- and Press
 Under the previous constitution, the right of free expression
 was protected by law-, but censorship, intimidation, and GPRA
 control of the media severely limited this right. The revised
 Constitution also provides for freedom of expression. In
 practice-, banners, posters, and public rhetoric highlycritical
 of the GPRA have proliferated, with no evidence of government
 interference in--the capital; however, UNITA and some of the
 emerging parties have complained of government interference in
 other provinces, citing as an example GPRA refusal to register
 students who openly support UNLTA. Some emergent parties also
 allege harassment of their activists in areas controlled by
 UNITA.
 The revised Constitution also guarantees freedom of the press,
 and law 22/91 provides the legal framework-by which periodicals
 and publishing companies, as well as foreign journalists and
 publications, are to be registered with the Ministry of
 Information. The establishment of news agencies is still
 reserved to the State. However, there are to date no
 independent publications.
 The government-owned news media remain heavily influenced by
 the GPRA, and almost always paint UNITA in a negative light.
 
 
 6
 ANGOLA
 Nevertheless, UNITA officials are often quoted
 straightforwardly in the government media, and increasing air
 time and print space are devoted to UNITA. The media also
 report regularly on third party activity. Hostile rhetoric and
 propaganda still abound on VORGAN (UNITA-controlled radio,
 heard in Luanda) and the FAPLA Armed Forces Radio Program
 "Angola Combatente," despite promises by both sides to refrain
 from such practices.
 The access of political parties to the electronic media for
 campaign purposes remains a contentious issue; the JPMC
 specified in its agreement on the electoral calendar that
 modifications to air time laws may be made to ensure
 "transparency and impartiality of the information media."
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The revised Constitution guarantees the right of peaceful
 assembly and association. Law 16/91 provides for the right to
 assemble in public and in private, a 3-day notification to
 authorities, and penalties for those who interfere in lawful
 demonstrations. The law bars military, paramilitary, or
 militia from participating in demonstrations. However, the law
 also makes participants liable for "offenses against the honor
 and consideration due to persons and to the organs of
 sovereignty." It is not known how this particular provision is
 being interpreted and applied.
 In practice, the law appears to have been generally respected,
 and most requests for rallies are routinely granted in the
 capital. Denials appear to be based on questions of public
 safety or timeliness of the requests. Police broke up a rally
 in front of the Luanda port because demonstrators gave only 1
 day's notice.   Several pro-UNITA demonstrations and others in
 support of emerging parties have been held in Luanda. However,
 UNITA has accused the-GPRA of interfering with its planned
 rallies in areas outside the capital, such as Cunene and
 Lobito. Some emerging parties charged that they have not been
 permitted to organize and to hold rallies in UNITA-controlled
 areas.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Constitution provides for the inviolability of
 freedom of conscience and belief and for separation of church
 and state, the authorities have in the past been critical of
 religious activities. Approximately 85 percent of the Angolan
 population is either Roman Catholic or Protestant, while most
 of the remainder practice a variety of animist beliefs. The
 GPRA has eased its antireligious stance but has yet to restore
 all church properties previously confiscated. Church services
 are held regularly and widely attended. Foreign and Angolan
 religious workers are allowed to carry out normal activities.
 UNITA respects freedom of religion in the areas it controls and
 provides limited administrative support to both Catholic and
 Protestant churches.
 The GPRA has in the past banned smaller religious sects that it
 deemed subversive, such as the Jehovah's Witnesses and the
 Tocoist Church, founded in Angola in 1949. The Tocoists have a
 syncretic blend of Christian beliefs and indigenous religious
 practices. However, recent information indicates that the ban
 on the two sects has been lifted.
 
 
 ANGOLA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Until May 1991, travel throughout Angola was tightly restricted
 by war and by regulations. Under the terms of the Peace
 Accords, free circulation of movement and goods is guaranteed.
 However, the GPRA and some international agencies have charged
 that UNITA has prevented them from entering UNITA-controlled
 areas, or that UNITA requires "visas" for travel into those
 areas and otherwise obstructs the movement of people..
 Angola currently hosts approximately 10,300 Zairian refugees,
 2,00 of which have registered for repatriation to Zaire.
 According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR), most of the more than 1,000 South African refugees
 have returned home on their own; the remainder may choose to
 stay in Angola. There are approximately 430,000 Angolan
 refugees resident in neighboring countries, most of whom have
 been in refugee status for many years. In April 1991,
 following fierce fighting in the Luena area just prior to the
 cease-fire, over 5,000 additional refugees fled to Zambia. In
 May, at the urging of the GPRA, about 600 GPRA soldiers were
 repatriated without UNHCR screening.
 Due to generally poor living conditions and danger posed by
 land mines in their home areas-, most of the 430,000 Angolan
 refugees resident in neighboring countries have not yet begun
 returning home in large numbers. At year's end, however,
 several thousand Angolans and Zairians had fled Zaire into
 northern Angola in the wake of Zairian unrest. The UNHCR is-
 planning to assist in the repatriaton of approximately 300,00a
 refugees which UNHCR estimates will elect to return home in the
 spring of 1992 following the rainy season.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 In 1991 citizens still did not have this right, and until May
 all political activity was still limited to participation in
 the MPLA-PT or in one of its controlled and sanctiened
 organizations. Groundwork to enable Angolans to change their
 government peacefully was laid in 1991 by. the rQvised
 Constitution, subsequent political laws on political parties,
 and the Peace Accords. At year's end, multiparty elections by
 secret ballot for President and a representative National
 Assembly were tentatively scheduled to take place in September
 1992. The new laws provide for independent poltical parties
 but prohibit regional or tribal parties. At year's end, 26
 parties had announced their intention to become established,
 though some complained they will have difficulty meeting the
 legislated requirements for registration. By December the
 Democratic Renewal Party (PRDY was awaiting certification of
 registration by the People's Supreme Court, the Angolan
 Democratic Party (PDA) had been denied registration, and the
 Allied Party of Angolan Youth, Workers, and Peasants Party
 (PAJOCA) had submitted its application for registraton.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Neither the GPRA nor UNITA permitted independent local human
 rights groups to operate-in its respective territory. In the
 past, neither the GPRAnor UNITA would allow international
 nongovernmentalhuman rights researchers into the country,
 
 
 8
 ANGOLA
 although the GPRA permitted Africa Watch (AW) personnel to
 travel in requested GPRA areas in late 1990 without an escort.
 AW also requested permission to visit UNITA-controlled areas;
 UNITA agreed in principle, but travel permits were not arranged
 during the requested timeframe. The GPRA did not cooperate
 with Amnesty International's request for information regarding
 numbers and identities of released prisoners and in the case of
 one death in custody.
 In 1991 the GPRA Defense and Security Council approved a
 protocol to allow the ICRC to visit state security prisoners,
 and visits took place.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution declares that all citizens are "equal before
 the law and enjoy the same rights and are subject to the same
 duties, without distinction as to color, race, ethnic origin,
 sex, place of birth, religion, level of education or social or
 economic status." Because of the unstable situation which
 prevailed in most of Angola during much of the year, there is
 little information available on the existence or extent of
 discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, language or
 social status. The number of-assault cases brought by women
 before Angolan courts is reportedly increasing; however, there
 is little information available on the extent of violence
 against women in Angola.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Until 1991 the sole legally recognized trade union organization
 in GPRA-administered Angola was the National Union of Angolan
 Workers (UNTA), which was formed in the late 1950's as an
 appendage of the MPLA and became the ruling party's official
 labor wing after Angolan independence in 1975. The monopoly
 position of the UNTA was ensured by the statutory basis of the
 single-union structure. Strikes were illegal and participation
 in strikes punishable by compulsory labor.
 The revised Constitution contains a provision recognizing the
 right of Angolans to form trade unions and to participate in
 trade union activities. New laws on unions and collective
 bargaining have been prepared but have not yet been published.
 By years's end, there had been no formation of independent
 labor unions as such. However, free labor activity increased
 as individual factories and offices formed their own workers'
 committees.
 The revised Constitution also recognizes the right to strike.
 Law No 23/91 of June 15, 1991 provides the detailed legal
 framework for the right to strike, including a prohibition on
 lockouts, a prohibition on worker occupation of employment
 premises, and protection of nonstriking workers. Strikes by
 certain workers, including military, police, prison workers and
 firefighters are prohibited, and strike limitations are imposed
 on workers in specific sectors affecting infrastructure and
 national defense.
 In fact, numerous strikes occurred before and after the
 promulgation of the new laws. While there were reports of
 scattered incidents of violence between strikers and police or
 
 
 ANGOLA
 strikers and nonstriking workers, there was no GPRA
 interference with strikers in thecapital, even in some cases
 in which strikers did not rigorously follow the law.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 In 1991 the revised Constitution gave Angolan workers the right
 to bargain collectively. As noted above, new laws on unions
 and collective bargaining have been prepared (but not yet
 published) which, inter alia, prohibit discrimination against
 union members. The GPRA, through its Ministry of Labor and
 Social Security, controls the process'of setting wages and
 benefits. Several significant salary increases were granted in
 1991 as a result of negotiations following work stoppages.
 There is no export processing zone.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or CompulsoryLabor
 Previous GPRA legislation authorized compulsory labor for
 breaches of labor discipline and participation in strikes. On
 the basis of this legislation, the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) in 1984 and 1990 cited the GPRA for
 violations of ILO Convention 105, which the GPRA ratified in
 1976. The new labor legislation prohibits forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 In 1976 the GPRA ratified ILO.Convention 6 governing night work
 of young persons and Convention 7 regarding the minimum age for
 employment at sea. The minimum age for employment of children
 is 16.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of, Work
 In 1991 the GPRA established a new minimum monthly wage. This
 minimum wage by itself is not sufficient to support a family,
 and many depend on informal sector trade to ensure a minimal
 standard of living. According to a decree- issued in 1982, the
 normal workweek is limited to 44 hours. The workweek is
 limited to 34 hours and 6 days a week.for persons aged 14 to
 16, and to 38 hours and 7 days a week for persons aged 16 to
 18. This decree applies to all state institutions, to state,
 semipublic, private, and cooperative undertakings, and to mass
 and social organizations. No information is available on the
 existence or adequacy of national occupational health and
 safety standards nor on actual practice with respect to any
 labor standards.
