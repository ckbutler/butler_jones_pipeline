 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 The Dominican Republic is a pluralistic, constitutional
 democracy with an elected president and a bicameral congress.
 The Supreme Court heads an independent judiciary whose members
 are appointed by the Senate. President Salvador Jorge Blanco
 is in the final year of a four-year term which began in August
 1982 following fair and competitive elections. Political
 parties representing the political spectrum from left to right
 freely participate in the political process and are actively
 engaged in preparations for national elections scheduled for
 May 16, 1986. The military is fully responsive to the
 civilian governmental authorities and committed to
 constitutional order.
 The Dominican Republic is a middle to lower income, developing
 country with a mixed economy based primarily on agriculture
 and services. Partly as a result of the 1930-1961
 dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo, the Government still accounts
 for 20 to 25 percent of the gross domestic product and
 controls several major industries. The national income is
 unevenly distributed, but there is a significant middle
 class. Historically, sugar has been the Dominican Republic's
 principal export. Faced with the prolonged depression of the
 world sugar market and low prices for its other agricultural
 exports, the country has confronted a serious economic crisis
 since 1982. To address these problems, the Government has
 undertaken difficult economic austerity and financial
 adjustment measures based on agreements with the International
 Monetary Fund (IMF). As a result, living standards have
 fallen, especially for the poor and lower middle class
 majority.
 During 1985, Dominicans continued generally to exercise and
 enjoy the broad range of human rights guaranteed them under
 the 1966 Constitution. The political environment remained
 unrestricted, and individuals and political groups freely
 debated and criticized the policies and programs of the
 Government. Preparations for the May 1986 elections moved
 forward. While opposition to the Government's economic
 austerity measures led to periodic protests and strikes, there
 was not a repeat of the violent disturbances which occurred in
 April 1984. On several occasions the Government temporarily
 detained Communist and other leftist political leaders as well
 as some labor leaders on the grounds that they were preparing
 illegal protest actions that would disrupt the civil peace.
 Although they have charged harassment, those detained were
 routinely released within the 48-hour constitutional limit for
 detention without charges.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known politically motivated killings in 1985.
 However, there have been allegations that government and
 police authorities may have- been involved in the murder of a
 foreign exchange trader, Hector Mendez, and his chauffeur in
 January 1985. The Government has made arrests and charged
 that the murders were perpetrated by terrorists seeking to
 raise funds for radical leftist political activities. The
 trial is pending. Also, a youth was apparently shot and
 
 
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 killed in March during clashes between police and students
 demonstrating in favor of a larger budget for the Autonomous
 University of Santo Domingo.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no credible reports of politically motivated'
 disappearances in 1985. A local, private human rights
 organization, The Dominican Human Rights Committee, and the
 International League for Human Rights issued reports in June
 which denounced 58 alleged disappearances between 1981 and
 1984. Also, Haitian refugees resident in the Dominican
 Republic have asserted that Israel Valmy and two other Haitian
 refugees disappeared after being arrested by government
 security forces in May. There is no reliable evidence to
 suggest that these alleged disappearances were politically
 motivated or involved the Government.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture, and it is not practiced.
 In 1985 there was a series of reports of police and security
 force abuse of prisoners, including the well-publicized death
 of popular band leader Tony Seval while in custody. The press
 routinely reports cases of police abuse. Prisoners and their
 families have access to the press which contributes to
 deterring cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment and
 encourages the Government to take corrective action. In most
 instances, government and police officials have indicated a
 concern to redress improper behavior by police, but they have
 not always effected the needed changes. Members of the
 National Police on the northern coast who abused tourists and
 extorted money were punished and removed from the force.
 However, other reports of extortion continue.
 The individual arrested and charged with the January murder of
 the local foreign exchange trader, Mendez, has since asserted
 that he confessed to the crime only after the police had
 threatened him and his family and tortured him. The case is
 still pending trial.
 The inadequately financed prison system suffers from
 unsanitary conditions and overcrowding. The overcrowding
 results in part from the slowness of the judicial process
 under which many prisoners remain in custody while awaiting
 trial. Financial constraints continue to handicap the
 Government's ability to improve the prison situation.
 Judicial authorities are studying measures to modernize the
 trial process and otherwise reform the administration of
 justice.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There are no known instances of arbitrary arrest, illegal
 detention, or exile of individuals for expressing views
 contrary to or critical of the Government.
 On several occasions in the first half of 1985, the Government
 detained members of radical leftist parties, labor
 organizations, and populist groups who were instigating or
 preparing to instigate public disturbances to protest economic
 austerity measures. Those so detained were usually released
 within 48 hours, which 'is the maximum period stipulated by the
 
 
 498
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 Constitution for holding suspects for investigation before
 arraignment. On February 5, for example, the Government
 arrested 14 leftist political and labor leaders who were
 involved in preparations for a nationwide general strike set
 for February 11, and charged them with activities prejudicial
 to public peace and constitutional order. The Attorney
 General issued a release order for the 14 on February 12, in
 response to a writ of habeas corpus ordered by the courts.
 There appears to be no evidence of policies or practices of
 forced labor, although isolated incidents may occur involving
 seasonal Haitian canecutters employed in the country's sugar
 industry. The Haitian canecutters can quit their jobs and are
 free to leave the plantations, but those who are illegal
 residents and those under contract to the State Sugar Council
 who have abandoned their jobs are subject to deportation.
 They are not forcibly returned to the fields.
 An agreement concluded in October 1984 between the Government
 of Haiti and the Dominican State Sugar Council (CEA) provided
 improvements in the situation of Haitian agricultural workers
 in the Dominican Republic. Among other provisions, the
 agreement reduces the possibility of forced labor by: (1)
 providing that Haitian workers be informed of the location
 where they are to work upon their arrival at the Dominican
 border; (2) abandoning the practice of transferring workers
 from one sugar plantation to another; (3) permitting Haitian
 workers to retain their own travel documents; and (4)
 providing vehicles equipped with loudspeakers to inform the
 workers in Creole of their rights and obligations.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are no known political prisoners.
 The Constitution guarantees a public trial. No special court
 for political or national security cases exists, and civilians
 may not be tried by a military court. Members of the armed
 forces are not tried by civilian courts, except under
 specified circumstances and only after a military board has
 reviewed the case and decided to permit the case to pass to
 the civilian courts. The appeals procedure, which includes
 appellate courts and the Supreme Court, is widely utilized.
 Court-appointed lawyers are usually provided at public expense
 to indigents only in criminal cases. They are seldom provided
 in criminal misdemeanor cases where their provision is at the
 court's discretion. Prosecuting attorneys are appointed by
 the executive branch.
 Judges at all levels are selected by the Senate and are
 independent of the executive branch, subject to removal or
 transfer by a majority vote in the Senate. Their terms of
 office correspond to that of the President and other elected
 officials, ending on the last day of the incumbent
 administration regardless of date of appointment. Judges have
 displayed independence in their actions and are not known to
 persecute opponents of the administration. However, judges
 earn a relatively low salary, and the fairness and quickness
 .of some trials have been subject to influence and
 manipulation. There is a widespread public belief, buttressed
 by some concrete reports, that judges and prosecutors at the
 lower court level accept bribes.
 Judges engaged in a nationwide strike between July and
 October, demanding higher salaries, better working conditions,
 
 
 499
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 and more resources for the judicial branch. During this
 period the administration of justice came to a virtual
 standstill. The strike was resolved when the Government
 raised the salaries of judges, promised additional financial
 resources for the courts, and agreed to permit the judicial
 branch to administer its own budget.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There have been no reports of arbitrary governmental
 interference with the private lives of individuals or
 families. Constitutional safeguards against invasion of the
 home are normally observed. A residence may not be searched
 unless the search is made in the presence of a prosecutor or
 an assistant prosecutor, except in cases of "hot pursuit" or
 when there is a probable cause to believe that a crime is
 actually occurring within the residence. Because of theft
 within the postal department there is little public confidence
 in the mail system.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These liberties are guaranteed by law and respected.
 Dominican newspapers are privately owned and freely reflect
 opposition points of view and criticism of the current
 Government. The numerous privately owned radio and television
 stations air all political points of view. Moreover, there
 are frequent exchanges of views between government officials
 and all media elements.
 There is no government censorship on political grounds.
 However, there have been cases in which the Government has
 taken action against media elements. For example, during
 strikes and protests which followed the Government's January
 23 announcement of economic austerity measures, some
 journalists were temporarily detained by security forces and
 removed from the scene of disturbances. Also at this time,
 the Government acted to prohibit mobile radio units from
 entering areas of Santo Domingo where strikes or disorders
 were occurring, ostensibly to avoid inciting further
 disorders. This restriction was subsequently lifted.
 In addition, there have been charges, denied by government
 spokesmen, that the Government sought to pressure the media
 against actively covering all aspects of the Hector Mendez
 murder case. Concern has also been expressed by some
 newspapermen and opposition politicians that the Government
 seeks to pressure and influence the media through its large
 advertising budget and the manner in which it distributes paid
 government advertisements to the newspapers, television, and
 radio stations.
 In December, the media and political opposition criticized the
 Government for ordering a privately owned television station
 to remain off the air and for allegedly playing a role in the
 cancellation of a talk show on another channel. In the first
 case, the station was owned by a prominent political figure of
 an opposition party. In the latter, the show's host had
 scheduled an interview with the leader of a rival faction
 within the ruling party. The Government has stated that the
 
 
 500
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 station was ordered off the air for technical irregularities
 in its transmissions and has denied any role in the talk
 show's cancellation.
 While customs authorities from time to time confiscate
 Communist literature, books of all political persuasions are
 readily available for public sale. University autonomy and
 academic freedom are respected by the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is guaranteed by
 the Constitution. Outdoor public marches and meetings require
 official government permits which are routinely granted.
 Throughout 1985 there were numerous such gatherings of parties
 and groups of diverse political orientations. Likewise,
 indoor gatherings of political parties, labor unions, and
 other associations are unrestricted.
 Labor unions have not historically played a significant role
 in the Dominican Republic, and less that 15 percent of the
 labor force is organized. The trade union movement is highly
 fragmented--there are eight national labor confederations--and
 very politicized. Moreover, the confederations exercise only
 a limited degree of control over their affiliates. Between
 October 1983 and mid-1985, however, over 250 new unions were
 officially recognized. Many of the confederations are
 affiliated with regional and international labor organizations.
 Approximately one-third of Dominican organized labor is
 Communist controlled or influenced. The politically
 affiliated labor organizations frequently pursue partisan
 political objectives rather than workers' economic demands.
 The Government has on occasion briefly detained labor union
 leaders in order to stop strikes or other labor actions it
 considered illegal. Rising unemployment and the continued
 deterioration of the nation's economy have hampered the growth
 of organized labor. Unions have the right to negotiate and to
 strike, even though they operate under the handicap of a dated
 labor code written during the Trujillo dictatorship that gives
 unions few rights vis-a-vis management. For example, there is
 no effective protection for organizers or union officials.
 The current administration has, however, given unions more
 leeway under the existing legislation than previously and has
 proposed legislation to modernize the labor code and enhance
 universally recognized labor rights.
 Professional organizations of lawyers, doctors, journalists,
 and others function freely. Like the unions, these
 organizations are free to maintain relations with counterpart
 international bodies of diverse political philosophies.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Discrimination on racial, religious, or ethnic grounds is
 prohibited by the Constitution. There are no religious
 requirements to hold public office, no restrictions on the
 practice of religious faiths, and no social discrimination
 based on religion. However, approximately 95 percent of the
 population is Roman Catholic, and the Church's preeminent
 position is accepted by the populace at large and is
 recognized in the Concordat between the Dominican Republic and
 the Holy See.

 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no unusual restrictions on travel within or outside
 the country. Many political exiles returned after a 1978
 amnesty, but a legal ban on the return of certain members of
 the Trujillo family still exists.
 The status and treatment of Haitians living in the Dominican
 Republic has been criticized by the press and the public, both
 in the Dominican Republic and abroad. The Haitian community
 of approximately 500,000 is composed mainly of illegal
 immigrants seeking employment and better living conditions.
 This figure also includes between 400 and 450 individuals,
 most opponents of Haitian President Duvalier, who have
 received "political refugee" status from the Dominican
 Government. Illegal immigrants are routinely deported under
 Dominican immigration law, while those seeking poltical refuge
 are not repatriated if the Government determines that they
 have a legitimate fear of persecution. There are restrictions
 against foreigners engaging in political activity directed
 against another country.
 In September, several Haitians with political refugee status
 in the Dominican Republic, who maintained that they were
 politically persecuted, were freely permitted to depart the
 country for Costa Rica. In October, two groups consisting
 respectively of six and seven Haitian residents of the
 Dominican Republic occupied the Venezuelan Embassy and the
 Italian Ambassador's residence in Santo Domingo. The
 Haitians, recognized as political refugees by both the
 Dominican Government and the United Nations High Commission on
 Refugees, charged that they were being politically persecuted
 by Haitian security forces in the Dominican Republic and
 requested asylum. The Dominican Foreign Ministry issued a
 communique rejecting the Haitians' charges, guaranteeing the
 safety of the refugees, and noting that the Haitians were
 completely free to leave the Dominican Republic if they
 desired. Subsequent Dominican government declarations stated
 that neither foreigners nor Dominicans are allowed to
 intimidate residents of the Dominican Republic and denied that
 Haitian intelligence agents operate inside the country.
 At the request of the concerned embassies, Dominican police on
 November 2 removed all those Haitians who had not previously
 departed the premises: three in the Venezulean mission and six
 in the Italian residence. The Haitians were not detained by
 Dominican authorities.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Dominican Republic is a functioning multiparty democracy
 in which governments are freely elected by the citizenry.
 Opposition groups of the left, right, and center are allowed
 to operate openly. The change in ruling parties brought about
 in the 1978 elections, and the free arid fair elections held in
 1982, demonstrate the established right of citizens to change
 their government via the ballot box. The ample participation
 of the opposition Social Christian Reformist Party and the
 pro-Cuban Dominican Liberation Party in the independent
 Dominican legislature underlines the climate for pluralism and
 political participation. Political parties and other
 political movements are freely engaged in organizational
 
 
 502
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 efforts and in campaigning for the national elections
 scheduled for May 16, 1986. In addition, the Central
 Electoral Board, an independent government body charged with
 administering the elections, has begun preparations to assure
 open, honest elections.
 In November, the internal nominating process of the ruling
 Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) was marred by
 irregularities and violence. Vote counting to determine the
 PRD presidential candidate was interrupted by a violent
 confrontation between rival bands inside convention
 headquarters the day after the party's convention and primary
 election. The official vote count had not resumed by the end
 of the year.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Dominican Republic participates actively in international
 and regional human rights bodies and supports human rights
 issues in international forums. International human rights
 organizations have been allowed free access to the country.
 The Government has cooperated fully with the investigation
 into the sensitive subject of the treatment of Haitian
 refugees and migrant workers. At the June 1985 meeting of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) Conference Committee on
 the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, the
 Dominican Government submitted a report identifying the
 changes it had introduced to improve the working conditions of
 Haitian sugar canecutters in the country. The report, which
 was generally well received, responded to criticisms contained
 in a 1983 ILO report on the situation of Haitian seasonal
 agricultural workers.
 Private organizations which freely report and comment on
 alleged human rights violations include the Dominican Human
 Rights Committee (CDH) and the Dominican Union for the Defense
 of Human Rights (UDHU). The major allegations of these
 organizations in 1985 were that the detention of leftist and
 labor figures was a means of harassment rather than
 investigation, and that the public order was not threatened by
 the actions or plans of those detained. The CDH also charged
 that there were 58 disappearances between 1981-1984, although
 the group did not assert that the majority of the
 disappearances were politically motivated or
 government-instigated. Rather, the CDH seemed to fault the
 Government for its failure to investigate adequately the
 disappearances. The Government has not harassed these
 organizations for their criticism of official actions or
 policies.
 In June the U.S.-based International League for Human Rights,
 drawing on information provided by the CDH, presented a report
 to the United Nations Working Group on Involuntary and Forced
 Disappearances which denounced 58 disappearances in the
 Dominican Republic. The report failed to present evidence
 that these were political disappearances.
 Amnesty International Report 1985 (covering 1984) expressed
 concern about "numerous short-term arrests of individuals,
 some of whom it believed may have been held on suspicion of
 non-violent opposition to the government." Freedom House
 rates the Dominican Republic "free."
 
 
 503
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Dominican Republic is a poor country with a population of
 approximately 6.6 million and an estimated annual population
 growth rate of 2.5 percent. Half of the population is under
 16 years of age. Since the early 1980's the low international
 price of sugar, the country's principal export, and the high
 cost of petroleum and other imports have seriously hurt the
 economy. Per capita income is estimated to be about 1370
 pesos per year. At the floating exchange rate of
 approximately 3 pesos to $1 (December 1985), per capita income
 is less than $460 per year. Unemployment, now estimated
 between 25 and 30 percent, is on the increase as economic
 growth has slowed and more individuals enter the labor
 market. At least another 20 percent of the labor force is
 believed to be underemployed. Poverty is widespread.
 Per capita calorie consumption barely meets minimum
 requirements, and only 59 percent of the population enjoys
 access to potable water. Health conditions are poor,
 particularly in the rural countryside. In 1985 major
 vaccination campaigns were continued by the Government to
 address some of these problems. In 1985, life expectancy at
 birth was 63.7 years, and the infant mortality rate was 73.8
 per 1,000 live births. Primary school enrollment is claimed
 to be over 90 percent, but some observers estimate the rate is
 closer to 75 percent. The literacy rate is 67 percent.
 Throughout the long and difficult negotiations with the
 International Monetary Fund in 1983 and 1984, the Government
 remained continually conscious of the impact of adjustment and
 austerity on the Dominican people. Although some offsetting
 measures taken by the Government may have been ill-advised in
 the eyes of some economists, they have doubtless made the
 adjustment process more socially and politically tolerable to
 the average Dominican.
 The Dominican labor code prohibits employment of youths under
 14 years of age, and restricts the nighttime employment of
 youths ages 14-18. The labor code also provides that
 employees under 18 work no more than eight hours a day, and,
 in addition to other limits on youth employment, specifies
 that those 18 years and younger will not be employed in
 dangerous or unhealthy jobs. In practice many of the
 restrictions in the labor code are ignored. Young people,
 including minors less than 14, engage in a wide variety of
 work which technically violates the labor regulations. For
 example, the labor code's provisions regulating vendors and
 shoeshine boys are not enforced.
 In 1985 the Government, recognizing the hardships entailed by
 the rising cost of living, took steps to raise the basic
 minimum monthly salary from 175 to 250 pesos (approximately
 $58 to $83) for both public and private sector employees (with
 some smaller businesses exempt from the new pay scale). At
 the same time, the minimum daily wage for agricultural workers
 was raised from 5 to 6 pesos. The labor code establishes that
 all workers are entitled to 24 hours of rest after six days of
 work; in practice, a typical work week is Monday through
 Friday plus half a day on Saturday. Safety and health
 conditions at the workplace do not always meet acceptable
 standards. The existing social security system is inadequate,
 although legislation to expand and improve it is before the
 Congress.
 
 
 504
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 Sexual and racial discrimination are prohibited by law and
 women's political rights have been recognized in legislation
 since 1942. Forty-seven percent of registered voters are
 women, and women hold both elective and appointed offices in
 the Government. The Jorge Blanco administration has
 established an office to encourage the advancement of women,
 and in 1983 the United Nations International Research and
 Training Institute for the Advancement of Women set up its
 headquarters in Santo Domingo. Divorce is easily attainable
 by either spouse, and women can hold property in theirown
 names apart from their husbands. Nonetheless, women
 traditionlly have not shared equal social and economic status
 or opportunity with men.
 There is subtle social discrimination against darker skinned
 Dominicans, although this has not prevented their success in a
 variety of fields, including elected political office.
 Dominicans, for historical reasons and because of sharp
 cultural differences, are generally prejudiced against
 Haitians. This prejudice carries over to the minority in the
 population who are Dominicans of Haitian descent. These
 prejudices, social tensions, and historical enmities sometimes
 result in violence which affects the Haitian migrant workers
 who enter the country under contract to cut sugar cane. In
 June, at least one, and possibly seven, Haitian canecutters,
 as well as one or more Dominicans, were killed during
 disturbances at a Dominican State Sugar Council plantation at
 Triple Ozama near Santo Domingo. The exact circumstances of
 the deaths are unclear, but it appears the incident stemmed
 from Haitian frustration at delays in the repatriation
 process. Although the conditions of the migrant Haitian
 workers have improved over the situation which existed several
 years ago, the incident underlines the fact that problems
 remain.
