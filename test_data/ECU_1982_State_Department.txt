 ECUADOR
 On August 10; 1979 Ecuador returned to constitutional
 government after eight years of military rule. Its Government
 is democratically elected. Since that time Ecuador largely has
 upheld guarantees of the integrity of the individual as well as
 political and civil liberties. Ecuador is a strong supporter
 of human rights within the Andean Pact and in Latin America.
 Freedom House, in its 1981 report, classified Ecuador as "free."
 Ecuador was placed under a constitutionally-authorized state of
 national emergency for one week in October 1982. The emergency
 measures, decreed in the face of a violent public reaction
 against a series of economic austerity policies instituted by
 the Government, included a night-time curfew and a ban on
 public demonstrations and street gatherings. During the state
 of emergency the Government also suspended briefly the
 operation of two radio stations for alleged violation of the
 radio-TV-broadcasting law. Other constitutional guarantees
 were not infringed.
 The Government is composed of an executive branch headed by a
 president and vice president, a unicameral legislature, and an
 independent judiciary. Local government consists of provincial
 and municipal councils, elected prefects, and mayors. All
 except the judicial officials are popularly elected. The
 President administers the National Police through the Minister
 of Government. Police power is in turn delegated to appointed
 provincial governors, intendants (provincial and municipal
 jurisdictions), and "political lieutenants" (parish level).
 The latter have the authority to arrest and fine in certain
 instances specified by law. Their actions may be challenged in
 court.
 With a per capita gross domestic product of $1,353 (1982
 estimate), Ecuador ranks as a moderately poor country. It is
 estimated that over half of the country's nearly nine million
 people live below the absolute poverty line. Large sectors of
 the population, particularly in rural areas, are not fully
 integrated into the national political and economic structure.
 Despite the burden of a large foreign debt and domestic budget
 deficit, the Government is carrying out an extensive, long-term
 national development program emphasizing improvements in the
 health care and educational systems, provisions of low-income
 housing and agrarian reform.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There have been no reports of politically-motivated killing,
 perpetrated by government forces, by quasi-official
 organizations, or by opposition or terrorist elements. However,
 two bomb attacks by unknown persons or groups were directed
 against targets in Quito in September and December 1982. The
 first caused minor damage to the headquarters of a Jewish
 association, while the second resulted in the death of three
 persons, injury to perhaps a dozen more and extensive damage to
 the building housing the Isreali Embassy.
 b. Disappearance
 There were in 1982 no reported instances where people have been
 abducted, secretly arrested, or held in clandestine detention
 by official or quasi-official elements.
 c. Torture
 The Constitution prohibits torture, and allegations of torture
 
 
 484
 by government officials are rare. However, instances of police
 brutality in some local jurisdictions are reported to occur
 although these are unsanctioned by the authorities.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Inhuman or degrading punishment is prohibited under Ecuadorean
 law. Prison conditions vary from institution to institution,
 but are generally poor due to limited resources. Cells are
 frequently overcrowded and lack adequate ventilation, light,
 sanitary facilities, and potable water. Prison authorities
 punish prisoners for disciplinary reasons; beatings and
 solitary confinement are often alleged and very probably do
 take place.
 Discriminatory treatment based on a prisoner's type of offense,
 social class, race, sex, or religion is not sanctioned in
 principle. In practice, however, prisoners with money can pay
 officials to avoid punishment or obtain better living
 conditions. With few exceptions, such as the women's prisons
 in Quito and Guayaquil, Ecuadorean penal institutions do not
 offer prisoner rehabilitation programs. The women's prisons in
 Quito and Cuenca are administered by the Sisters of the Good
 Shepherd, who organize retreats and other rehabilitative
 activities for prisoners. S6me prisoners in Ecuadorean
 institutions can qualify for privileges such as day passes,
 conjugal visits, and the right to establish a business within
 the prison.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The right of habeas corpus is constitutionally guaranteed for
 all citizens, except in cases involving arrest during actual
 commission of a crime, the infraction of military law, or
 failure to obey a police officer. During 1982 both the
 President of the Supreme Court and the Government's Controller
 General criticized certain municipal jurisdictions for having
 abused the right of habeas corpus by releasing from custody
 suspects accused of serious criminal activity. A criminal
 suspect may be legally held without charge for a maximum of 72
 hours. Preventive detention is illegal, although a Quito
 police publication acknowledged that persons with criminal
 records, who were unemployed and/or without fixed residences,
 were subject to detention if apprehended under suspicious
 circumstances. Trade union leaders have charged that some 200
 persons detained during a two-day general strike in September
 were still being held in police custody one month later. In
 December 1982 trade union leaders statad that all persons
 detained by the Government during the disturbances in October
 were subsequently released.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trail
 Ecuador has a three-tiered court system. The lowest level
 consists of civil and penal courts and specialized labor
 relations, housing, and traffic courts. At the intermediary
 level are the superior courts located in most of Ecuador's 20
 provinces. The highest level is the Supreme Court, whose
 judges select the ordinary civil and penal judges and the
 specialized judges.
 As in many civil code countries, judges play a central role in
 investigation as well as in deciding guilt or innocence.
 Defendants have the right to counsel, to refrain from
 testifying against themselves, and to appeal to the superior
 and supreme courts in case of conviction. Defendants may also
 request the constitutional guarantees tribunal, (an 11-member
 body made up of executive, legislative, and judicial branch
 officials and representatives of labor, industry, and the
 public at large), to investigate allegations of denial of
 
 
 constitutional or human rights. Military courts are empowered
 to try only those cases involving infractions of armed forces
 personnel and criminal acts directed against military
 installations, personnel, and legitimate military activities.
 The court system is substantially independent in practice. For
 example, in June the Guayaquil superior court threw out a
 Government charge of sedition against an opposition figure.
 The Supreme Court, in another case, declared unconstitutional a
 part of the political parties law, which had been challenged by
 the Ecuadorean Communist Party.
 Trial procedures are often lengthy; prisoners sometimes wait up
 to two years between arrest and sentencing. At least some of
 the over-crowding of Ecuador's prisons is attributed to the
 large number of convicted criminals awaiting sentencing. Time
 spent in prison counts toward completion of the final sentence.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Ecuadorean Government respects the sanctity of the home in
 theory and practice. Police must have a warrant in order to
 enter a home except in case of hot pursuit. Any judge may
 issue a search or arrest warrant.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and expression,
 and this right is vigorously exercised in the Ecuadorean mass
 information media. The penal code does establish penalties for
 persons convicted of slandering government officials, although
 this provision has not been invoked in almost two years.
 Newpapers, representing a wide range of political opinions, are
 privately owned and free from government intervention. There
 is no media censorship and, except for pornography, no
 censorship of foreign or domestic books, films, or works of
 art. The state of emergency imposed by President Hurtado in
 October 1982 exempted press censorship from suspension of
 constitutional guarantees, although the Government invoked
 provisions of the radio-TV-broadcasting law to close two radio
 stations--one in Quito and the other in Guayaquil--for five
 days for allegedly provocative broadcasts. Ecuadorean
 journalists must belong to the journalists' guild in order to
 practice their profession. There is no Government interference
 with academic inquiry.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of free assembly and association is established in
 the Constitution. Public rallies require prior consent from
 the local government. This normally is granted. However,
 during an illegal two-day national labor strike in September
 1982, a street demonstration in Guayaquil was forcibly broken
 up by police, and arrests occurred. Strike leaders charged
 that police invaded several union headquarters, destroyed
 private property, and arrested several union leaders. These
 allegations were denied by the Government. In October the
 invocation under the Constitution of a temporary state of
 national emergency resulted in a night-time curfew and
 restrictions on the right of public assembly. An indeterminate
 number of persons were arrested for violating the curfew; most
 were released shortly after payment of a small fine.
 Trade unions, which represent less than ten percent of the
 economically active population, are organized into three major
 confederations, reflecting different political orientations,
 and several independent labor organizations. All blue-collar
 workers, including those employed by the Government, enjoy the
 
 
 486
 right to organize trade unions, to bargain collectively, and to
 strike. Government white-collar workers have the right to
 organize and bargain collectively, but not to strike. The
 Ecuadorean labor code provides for considerable government
 involvement in the resolution of labor-management disputes,
 especially through the Labor Ministry's mediation service and
 the system of labor courts. Trade union leaders are elected by
 the rank-and-file. The Constitution provides for the formal
 participation of trade unions in government through labor
 representation on the executive boards of the National
 Development Council, the Social Security Institute, the
 Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal, and the Vocational Training
 Institute.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion. Clergymen may not become high-
 level elected or appointed government officials. Ecuadoreans
 are free to practice the religion of their choice, and foreign
 missionaries operate freely in Ecuador.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Ecuadoreans may freely travel internally or abroad. There is
 no discriminatory treatment of women or other groups in matters
 of travel, emigration, or repatriation. However, Ecuadorean
 citizens and foreign adult residents must prove their
 compliance with income and other tax requirements in order to
 obtain an exit permit. Ecuadorean males must also show they
 have complied with the military service requirement in order to
 travel abroad. In April 1982 Ecuadorean military forces along
 the Ecuadorean-Colombian frontier captured five armed
 Colombians, including a teenage girl, who were identified as
 guerrillas. Press accounts quoted the Ecuadorean Defense
 Minister as saying that the group was turned over to Colombian
 authorities under the terms of a bilateral agreement covering
 border incidents such as these.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Ecuador is a functioning multiparty democracy. Ecuadoreans 18
 years of age and over have the right to vote. Voting is
 mandatory for literates and voluntary for illiterates; it is
 done by secret ballot. Citizens lacking a valid reason for not
 voting are subject to fines. All citizens have the right to
 form and join political parties. There are currently 12
 certified political parties, including one communist party,
 represented in the national congress. In September 1982 the
 Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a provision of the
 political party law which withdrew certification from parties
 not receiving at least five percent of the popular vote in the
 most recent national elections. This provision had prohibited
 several small parties from legally certifying and fielding
 candidates for electoral office. Ecuador's elections under the
 democratic system since 1979 have been considered competitive
 and fair by outside observers. Representative bodies often
 fail to support central government proposals. For much of
 1982, the Government lacked a congressional majority.
 There are no laws discriminating against women or other groups
 with regard to political participation or suffrage. Ecuador is
 a conservative traditional society; as a result, there are few
 highly placed women in the Ecuadorean political structure. One
 of the few female politicans of stature heads the Alfarist
 Radical Front Political Party. Several women have served at
 the ministerial and undersecretarial level in the Hurtado
 administration. Ecuador's 69-member Congress includes blacks
 and persons of Indian origin.

 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Ecuador is an active participant in international and regional
 human rights organizations. In March 1982 the United Nations
 Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination commended
 Ecuador for its performance in that area, as well as in the
 field of human rights generally. In September Dr. Julio Prado
 Vallejo was re-elected to a term on the Human Rights Committee
 of the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
 Several human rights organizations, both church and
 lay-sponsored, exist in Ecuador, including affiliates of
 Amnesty International and the International Commission of
 Jurists. The Latin American Human Rights Association, founded
 in 1980 with assistance from the West German Friedrich Ebert
 Foundation, is headquartered in Quito. In October the Ministry
 of Health and that association signed an agreement establishing
 a jointly-funded program of cooperation and research on a
 number of human rights issues, including health and prison
 conditions.
 Since the return to democratic rule in 1979, the Ecuadorean
 Government has made it clear that international and
 non-government human rights organizations are welcome to
 investigate human rights conditions in Ecuador. When Nobel
 Peace Prize recipient Adolfo Perez Esquivel visited Ecuador in
 February 1981, he cited human rights concerns in appealing to
 the Government for the release of certain convicted peasents in
 Azuay province. In April,. the Catholic Church-sponsored
 ecumenical human rights commission criticized the forced
 expulsion by the local government in Manta of some 4,000
 squatters from lands they had seized. The commission charged
 violation of the constitutional right for all Ecuadoreans to
 food, shelter, and health.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Ecuador faces significant challenges in meeting economic and
 social development needs. Ninety-seven percent of the
 country's estimated population of 8,945,000 lives in the Andean
 highlands and on the coast; the remainder live in the Galapagos
 Islands and the eastern jungle. Incorporating a 1982 currency
 devaluation, gross domestic product is estimated at $1,353.
 About 45 percent of the population resides in rural areas,
 where incomes and living conditions are generally inferior to
 those in the cities. The annual population growth rate is
 estimated at 3.1 percent.
 Ecuador has made significant gains in the area of health care,
 credited principally to improved health delivery systems and to
 an increased number of doctors. The average life expectancy at
 birth increased from 57.2 years in 1968 to 61.2 years in 1980.
 The infant mortality rate declined from about 140 per 1,000
 live births in 1960 to 66 per 1,000 in 1981.
 Despite these advances, health care remains a problem for
 Ecuador. Although 80 percent of the urban population now has
 access to clean water (compared with 36 percent in 1975) and 70
 percent to sewage disposal, these figures drop to 13 percent
 and 5 percent respectively, for rural areas. Calculations
 based on two 1975 surveys indicated that 59 percent of the
 population (40 percent in urban areas, 65 percent in rural
 areas) lived under conditions of absolute poverty. The ratio
 of caloric supply relative to nutritional needs is 92 percent.
 In Oc-ober 1982 the Government initiated a school breakfast
 program in the province of Cotopaxi, which will eventually be
 expanded nationwide.
 
 
 488
 Rapid expansion of the education system in recent years has
 resulted in a dramatic improvement in school enrollments and
 overall literacy. Twenty-nine percent of the national budget
 in 1982 was earmarked for education and, despite austerity
 measures currently in effect, an absolute increase in education
 expenditures is being proposed for 1983. In 1981 there were
 1,449,264 persons enrolled in primary level education, for an
 age-group ratio of 108 percent. As a result of an intensive
 literacy program, which reached 232,000 illiterates from 1979
 to 1981, adult literacy has improved from 74.2 percent in 1974
 to over 84 percent in 1981. In September 1982 Ecuador was
 commended by UNESCO for its success in combatting illiteracy.
 The Ecuadorean Government is attempting to improve the social
 and economic conditions of the most needy of Ecuador's
 population through a five-year development plan (1979-1984).
 Among the special concerns of this plan are low-income housing
 and integrated rural development. Many housing units are
 considered sub-standard; two-thirds of all dwellings have two
 rooms or less. As part of a long-term program of agrarian
 reform, the Government by 1981 had distributed some 250,000
 hectares to over 14,000 rural families.
 The Constitution grants women the same rights and privileges as
 men in ail aspects of public and private life, and Ecuador has
 ratified the UN convention on the Elimination of Discrimination
 Against Women. Although both men and women may file for civil
 divorce, the civil code contains family, property, and sexual
 behavior provisions which discriminate against women or entail
 a double standard. Cultural traditions rather than law are
 largely responsible for the second-class status of women in
 Ecuadorean society. In 1974, 43.5 percent of rural females
 over six years of age received no formal education. While the
 educational situation has improved substantially, women
 continue to lag well behind men at all educational levels
 except higher education. Female enrollment at this level
 numbered over 80,000 in 1979, or 35 percent of the total.
 Women represent 35 percent of Ecuador's economically active
 population of 2.9 million. Urban women are usually employed as
 secretaries, teachers, clerks, or household servants; they are
 underrepresented in the technical, legal, and medical
 professions, as well as at the higher levels of government.
 Upper and middle class women are making some progress. About
 12 percent of business executives are women although it appears
 that women are paid less than men in equal or comparable
 positions.
 The annual inflation rate through November 1982 was 22
 percent. According to official indices, urban unemployment is
 probably in the 8-9 percent range, while underemployment may be
 as high as 45 percent in urban areas and 75 percent in the
 countryside. Unemployment is higher among women than men.
