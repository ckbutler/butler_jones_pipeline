 URUGUAY
 Uruguay is a constitutional republic governed by an elected
 president and a bicameral legislature, with an independent
 judicial branch. Its longstanding democratic tradition was
 interrupted by 12 years of military rule from 1973 to 1985,
 but, following a free and fair election in November 1989, on
 March 1, 1990, power was transferred from one elected civilian
 President to another for the first time since the return to
 constitutional government in 1985. Political parties, the
 press, labor unions, private interest groups, and other
 nongovernmental groups function freely and political debate is
 vigorous and unrestricted.
 Uruguay's small military establishment, consisting of an army,
 air force, and navy, is under the supervision of the Ministry
 of Defense. The military does not participate in domestic
 security matters unless ordered to do so by the civilian
 authorities. Domestic security and public safety matters are
 under the jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry, which
 administers all of the country's police departments.
 Uruguay is a middle income country (with a per capita gross
 domestic product of $2,736 in 1989) whose economy is heavily
 dependent on agricultural exports and agroindustry. The
 economy is a mixture of private enterprise and state entities;
 private property rights are respected. After significant
 growth in 1986 and 1987, the economy slowed dramatically in
 1988 and 1989, and was not expected to show significant
 improvement in 1990. Trends which had fueled growth in
 1986-&7 suffered a reversal, as manifested by increasing oil
 prices, higher international interest rates, stagnant domestic
 demand and investment, and rising inflation.
 During 1990, an important human rights issue was the treatment
 of prisoners in the Uruguayan penal system. Several prisoners
 died while in custody, leading to charges of government
 neglect and substandard care and facilities. A disappearance
 which occurred 14 years ago during the military regime also
 received much public attention when a serving Uruguayan
 Senator was accused of complicity in the disappearance.
 Finally, violence against women and discrimination against
 Uruguay's black minority continued to be blemishes on
 Uruguay's otherwise good human rights record.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person,. Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 No cases of politically motivated killing were reported.
 b. Disappearance
 No cases of disappearance were reported during 1990. A 1976
 case received renewed attention when a serving senator of the
 opposition Colorado Party was accused of complicity in the
 disappearance of a political activist. The Senator was the
 Foreign Minister when the woman in question was kidnaped by
 government security forces while seeking asylum on the grounds
 of the Venezuelan Embassy, an action which led Venezuela to
 break diplomatic relations with Uruguay. The Senator was
 exonerated by his fellow Senators in a majority vote taken
 
 
 URUGUAY
 in September. At the end of the year several persons were
 trying to initiate judicial proceedings against him.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits any harmful treatment of
 prisoners. In practice, however, generally poor conditions in
 the Uruguayan prison system have given rise to charges of
 prisoner neglect and mistreatment. Prisoners suffer from
 inadequate professional supervision, insufficient exercise and
 rehabilitation training, and lack of medical attention. One
 prisoner at the country's maximum security La Libertad prison
 died in July. Prison authorities claimed that he died from
 injuries suffered during a collision while playing soccer, but
 a prisoners' group charged that his death was caused by
 injuries received during a prison shakedown 6 days earlier.
 An investigation by judicial authorities exonerated prison
 officials of any wrongdoing. Two other prisoners committed
 suicide at Libertad prison in August, and at least one other
 prisoner at Libertad attempted suicide, durinq the-same month.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest.. Detention. or- Exile
 The Constitution requires a written.warrant for an arrest,
 except in cases where the accused is apprehended during. the
 commission of a crime. It also provides for the right to a
 judicial determination of the legality of detention and
 requires that the detaining authority in an arrest explain and
 justify to the judiciary the legal grounds for the detention.
 An arrested person has the right to counsel and the right to
 give a statement and appear before a judge within 24 hours of
 detention. The judge must begin the judicial process within
 48 hours of arrest. Failure to comply with this 48-hour rule
 has led to the release of accused persons. Bail is allowed
 for those criminal charges which could lead to a penitentiary
 sentence. These constitutional provisions are generally
 respected in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Uruguay has a judicial system based on the Napoleonic Code.
 Under the penal code, an arrested person may be held
 incommunicado by the police for a period of 24 hours before
 being presented to a judge. After a judge initiates judicial
 proceedings against the accused person (which must be within
 24 hours), he is given access to legal counsel, and if he
 cannot afford a lawyer, a public defender is appointed. If
 the crime carries a penalty of at least 2 years in prison, the
 accused person is confined- during the judge's investigation
 unless the authorities agree to release him on bail, or until
 the case is closed.
 The Constitution requires that all trials must open with a
 public statement of the charge by the prosecutor or the
 complainant. Trial proceedings are based on written arguments
 (which are not normally made public), and the defense attorney
 has access to all documents which form part of the written
 record. During 1990 the Uruguayan legal system was in the
 process of introducing oral arguments into court proceedings.
 Under Uruguayan law, there is no provision against
 self-incrimination, and the defendant may be compelled to
 answer any questions posed by the judge.
 
 
 URUGUAY
 The law provides for two military justices on the Supreme
 Court who participate only in cases involving the military.
 Military justice is applicable to civilians only during a
 state of war or insurrection. There is a parallel military
 court system under the Military Justice Code.
 Uruguay has no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for the right to privacy. The home,
 absolutely inviolable at night, may be entered and searched
 only with a legal warrant during the day. Protection for
 private papers and correspondence is equally strong, and a
 warrant is required for confiscation. These rights and
 safeguards are well respected in practice.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press.
 All elements of the political spectrum express their
 viewpoints in both the print and broadcast media. Formerly
 proscribed organizations, such as the Tupamaro Movement (which
 engaged in terrorist activities in the late 1960's and early
 1970's) and the Communist Party, freely publish newspapers and
 operate radio stations. Montevideo has 7 daily newspapers and
 there are approximately 65 to 70 weekly newspapers in the
 interior of the country. Uruguay has 110 radio stations, and
 20 television stations. The only government-owned media
 outlets are one television station and one radio station.
 The National University is autonomous, and academic freedom is
 respected. University elections have been held three times
 since 1985, and student groups have resumed campus political
 activities. Most professors dismissed for political or
 ideological reasons during military rule have returned to
 their positions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association are protected by law.
 Formerly banned groups, such as the Tupamaros, freely organize
 and express their opinions. Public marches and demonstrations
 are allowed with permits from the Ministry of the Interior and
 occur without official harassment or intimidation. Persons
 who were denied citizenship rights by the military regime
 because of political affiliation or activity have had their
 rights fully restored.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion, provided for by the Constitution, is
 respected in practice. Most Uruguayans who practice a
 religion are Roman Catholic. Members of other religions
 exercise their faiths unhindered, and missionaries are free to
 proselytize. Uruguayans who profess agnosticism or atheism
 express their views freely.

 URUGUAY
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Internal and foreign travel and emigration are unrestricted.
 Uruguayans who left the country during the military regime and
 wish to return are encouraged to do so. All of the prominent
 political figures exiled by the military regime have returned.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The citizens of Uruguay have the right and ability peacefully
 to change the government. Uruguay is a multiparty democracy,
 with mandatory universal suffrage for those 18 years of age or
 older. Voting is not restricted by race, sex, religion, or
 economic status. The Colorado Party, the National (Blanco)
 Party, a coalition named the- Broad Front, and a coalition
 named New Space are the four major political entities. Each
 allows ideological divisions within the party, and each such
 division may field its own slate of candidates for general
 elections. The electoral system combines a primary and
 general election in a double simultaneous vote. Each party
 fields different lists of candidates; in essence, voters
 express a preference for a list rather than an individual
 candidate, as well as vote for a party. The winning list of
 the party which gets the most votes wins the presidency and a
 percentage of seats in the Senate and Chamber of Deputies
 corresponding to the percentage of votes that the party as a
 whole received. A party therefore may run multiple
 presidential candidates, each with his or her own slate of
 legislative candidates. National and provincial elections are
 held simultaneously every 5 years.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The human rights performance of the Government since its
 return to democratic rule in 1985 has not been the subject of
 attention by international and local human rights
 organizations, with the major exception of their serious
 concern about, and continuing opposition to, the Law of
 Expiration (the law which effectively amnestied all police and
 military personnel who may have committed human rights abuses
 during the military regime). The law was upheld by a majority
 of the Uruguayan electorate in an April 1989 plebiscite. The
 Government is open to inquiries from such organizations and
 does not restrict the activities of human rights investigators.
 Local human rights groups, some of which could not operate
 openly under military rule, now function freely and without
 restriction. A prominent local human rights group, Peace and
 Justice Service (SERPAJ), was legalized in early 1985 after
 operating underground for 2 years during the military regime.
 SERPAJ investigates prison conditions and cases involving
 killing, torture, and disappearances which occurred during the
 military regime. SERPAJ during 1990 also assisted the legal
 claims of a family seeking to gain custody of a child who they
 claim was taken from them by security forces during the
 military regime. In September a bipartisan group of
 parliamentarians joined with representatives from the
 religious, legal, and social service (including SERPAJ)
 sectors to form a working group to develop initiatives to
 "humanize" the penal system, in part by replacing police
 
 
 796
 URUGUAY
 supervision with civilian professionals. The Government has
 expressed support for the working group's efforts.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination based on the above factors is prohibited by the
 Constitution and by law, and there is no evidence of
 officially sanctioned discrimination. During the year there
 were a series of anti-Semitic incidents which included the
 defacing of.gravestones and the painting of Nazi graffiti on
 the doors of a synagogue. In addition, Nazi graffiti were
 found on an elderly woman who was robbed and murdered. The
 Government strongly condemned these incidents.
 Uruguay's black minority consists of approximately 4 percent
 of the population (120,000 to 130,000). Blacks are
 underrepresented among the elite groups and are almost
 completely absent from the professional, bureaucratic,
 political, and academic sectors of society due to the lack of
 educational background and social and political connections
 necessary for entry into these groups. The Government has not
 addressed this problem because most Uruguayans do not believe
 that racial discrimination is a problem in Uruguay .
 Uruguayan women enjoy equality under the law, but they face a
 number of forms of discrimination owing to traditional
 attitudes and practices. Approximately one-third of the work
 force is made up of women; some pursue professional careers,
 and they attend the National University in large numbers.
 However, pay is not always equal for men and women, especially
 in less skilled jobs. Most women are employed in traditional
 "women's" jobs, and in business and the professions women
 generally are not promoted to the highest positions .
 Violence against women exists within and outside the conjugal
 relationship, but until recently this problem received little
 publicity. It is difficult to establish the extent of the
 problem or to determine if it is increasing. The existing
 evidence is mainly anecdotal; statistics are only slowly being
 accumulated. Though lacking hard statistics, Catholic Church
 sources state that the problem of violence against women has
 increased (due in part to economic problems) and is an issue
 about which there is now greater public awareness. In October
 and November the country's most prestigious weekly newspaper
 published a series of in-depth articles on the subject.
 Several women's groups provide assistance to abused women and
 also have programs to publicize the problem and educate the
 citizenry. A government agency, the Commission of Women,
 receives the complaints of abused women, and the penal code
 mandates a sentence of from 3 months in jail to 3 years in
 prison for the crime of "private violence." The main legal
 recourse for abused women lies in making a legal complaint
 against a spouse or boyfriend; in practice, many women are
 unable to make and sustain such a complaint, especially those
 who continue to reside with their partners.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of workers to organize
 freely and encourages the formation of unions. Civil servants
 may join unions as may employees of state-run enterprises.
 
 
 797
 URUGUAY
 All labor unions are independent of government or governing
 party control.
 The member unions of the Interunion Workers Assembly-National
 Workers Association (PIT-CNT) have 222,310 members (as of May
 1990). These unions, which account for about 80 percent of
 organized workers, act as bargaining units for about 400,000
 workers. The PIT-CNT is a voluntary confederation of
 independent unions, and there are a number of strong
 autonomous unions as well. Uruguayan workers, including some
 civil servants, have the right to strike, and many unions did
 so during 1990. The expiration of almost all industrial
 sector contracts (negotiated in 1988) as of June 1, 1990, led
 to an ingrease in the number of strikes in the latter half of
 1990. No institutionalized mechanisms for arbitration or
 mediation exist, but the Ministry of Labor and Social Security
 does take on the role of mediator on an ad hoc basis.
 Workers can be legally compelled to work during a strike if
 their work is- considered to be an essential service, the
 definition of which is relatively limited although it may in
 some cases exceed International Labor Organization (ILO)
 guidelines. In 1990, the "essential services" provision was
 invoked to maintain bus service in Montevideo during transport
 and general strikes.
 In May 1990, the Labor Ministry released a draft of a proposed
 labor law that would restrict the almost unlimited right of
 labor to strike. The proposed law would mandate that a union
 could call a strike only with the approval of a majority of
 its membership as expressed through a mandatory, secret
 ballot. The law would define legal and illegal strikes and I
 enumerate protections for workers (against lockout and
 permanent replacement) who participate in a legal strike, as
 well as the rights of employers subjected to an, illegal
 strike. The draft text was submitted by the Labor Minister to
 the I10 in June for comment. Changes were being made to the
 draft at year's end to take into account certain possible ILO
 objections to the proposed law.
 There are no restrictions on the unions' right to affiliate
 with international trade union bodies. By choice, the PIT-CNT
 is not officially affiliated with any of the three world
 federations. Many individual unions are affiliated with
 international trade secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 While no institutionalized mechanism for resolving complaints
 against employers exists in Uruguay, discrimination by
 employers, including arbitrary dismissal for union activity
 generally is prohibited. In August 1990, the Supreme Court,
 citing a law from the era of military government, ruled that
 an employee may be fired for participating in an illegal
 strike. In July a Ministry of Labor legal advisory panel ruled
 that a number of commonly practiced job actions (e.g., partial
 strikes and refusal to work overtime) employed by organized
 labor are not protected by the Constitution.
 Collective bargaining completely disappeared during the period
 of military rule. Since the return of civilian government,
 industrial contracts have been negotiated on a sector-wide
 rather than plant-by-plant basis. These negotiations take
 place under the auspices of a tripartite (government, workers,
 management) organization known as a Salary Council; each
 
 
 798
 URUGUAY
 industrial sector has its own council. The role played by the
 Government can vary from council to council. In some, the
 government representatives see themselves primarily as
 arbitrators or mediators and participate in the negotiations
 only when there is an impasse. In others, the government
 representative is an active, equal participant in all phases
 of the negotiations. The Government must approve contracts
 before they become legally binding on the parties; during the
 June-August 1988 round of negotiations, the Government
 approved only those contracts negotiated under the council
 system. Most employers like the security gained from the
 council system; most unions like the equity of wages that
 result from sector-wide negotiation. The 1990 session of
 Salary Council negotiations was convoked for September by the
 Labor Minister who stated publicly that the Government will
 leave contract negotiations strictly to labor and management
 beginning January 1991.
 Workers employed in the two special export zones are fully
 covered by all labor legislation. There are no unions in
 either zone, but there are as yet relatively few workers in
 traditionally organizable occupations.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law, and there is
 no evidence that would indicate its existence in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children are protected by a child labor code, violations of
 which are punishable by fines of up to $500. Children under
 the age of 15 generally are not employed, but children as
 young as 12 may be legally employed if they have a special
 government work permit. Children under the age of 18 may not
 perform dangerous, fatiguing, or night work, apart from
 domestic employment. Salaries and hours for children are
 controlled more strictly than" for adults. Children over the
 age of 16 may sue in court for payment of wages, and children
 have the legal right to dispose of their own income. Children
 working in the expanding informal sector, such as street
 vendors or others with no fixed place of work or in the
 agrarian sector, are generally less strictly regulated and
 receive lower pay.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The legislated minimum wage is approximately $80.48 per month
 for industrial workers. The minimum wage appears to be
 effectively enforced and adhered to in the sectors to which it
 is applicable. Under the previous administration, the minimum
 wage was adjusted every 4 months; adjustments were indexed to
 90 percent of the rate of inflation for the previous 4-month
 period. The minimum wage was raised in June and again in
 September, but it was not clear if the policy of adjustment by
 fixed-period raises would continue under the new Government.
 A family dependent on one minimum wage would be living below
 the "poverty line"; that family would be in the poorest 20
 percent of the population.
 The standard workweek is 48 hours for a 6-day week.
 Industrial workers receive overtime compensation for work in
 excess of 48 hours. Workers are entitled to 20 days' paid
 vacation after a year of employment; this vacation period
 increases with each year of employment  Workers are protected
 
 
 799
 URUGUAY
 by legislation regulating the health and safety of working
 conditions; existing laws and regulations appear to be
 generally adhered to in practice. Parliamentary studies of
 health and safety needs in 1989 failed to result in any new
 legislation. Some labor regulations cover urban, industrial
 workers more adequately than rural and agricultural workers.
