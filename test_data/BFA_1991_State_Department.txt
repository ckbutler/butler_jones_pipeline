 BURKINA FASO
 In 1991 Burkina Faso remained under the rule of President
 Blaise Compaore, who toppled Thomas Sankara on October 15,
 1987, in the country's fourth military coup since 1980. In
 June 1990, President Coipaore began a carefully controlled
 process-of government restructuring and reform, legalizing
 opposition parties and independent media but dictating
 arrangements for the transition to multipartyelections. A new
 Constitution, approved by referendum in June 1991, contains
 provisions which, if fully implemented, would provide citizens
 a wide range of civil and political rights. Opposition groups
 originally participated in a broad-based transitional
 government but withdrew when the President refused to accept a
 national. conference or to negotiate changes in arrangements for
 the pLesidential -elections on December 1. The opposition
 refused to participate in the elections, and only an estimated
 25 percent of the registered electorate turned out to vote,
 thus denying Compaore the mandate he sought. In the aftermath
 of that vote, opposition activist Clement Ouedraogo was killed
 in a grenade attack, and another opposition member,'Moctar
 Tall, was seriously injured in a separate attack. Many
 Burkinabe believd the Government was responsible for the
 attacks.
 Burkina Yaso's security-apparatus consists of the armed forces,
 the paramilitary gendarmerie, and the police, all controlled by
 the Ministry of Defense. Although the situation improved from
 previous years, elements of the security services, used-for
 policeduties, were responsible for human rights abuses in
 1991, including mistreatment of detainees.
 Burkina Faso is overwhelmingly dependent on subsistence
 agriculture which, in turn, is highly vulnerable to variable
 rainfall. Frequent drought, weak communications and
 transportation infrastructure, and a low literacy rate are all
 longstanding problems. Per capita income is approximately $300
 a year.. In March the Government.reached agreement with the
 World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on a 3-year
 structural adjustment program. This program aims to open the
 economy to free market forces, promote privatization, and
 attract foreign investment.
 The Government instituted some limited human rights
 improvements in 1991, most notably in releasing two groups of
 political detainees: those implicated in a December 1989 coup
 attempt and students arrested during protests at the University
 of Ouagadougou in May 1990. On July 25, President Compaore
 declared a general amnesty pardoning those found guilty of
 political-offenses since the country's independence and
 restoring their civil rights. The appearance of privately
 owned newspapers stimulated critical discussion of reform.
 However, these developments were clouded by the Government's
 intimidation of political opponents and local human rights
 activists and by the assassination of Clement Ouedraogo.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the- Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 In addition to the assassination of Clement Ouedraogo and the
 attempt on the life of Moctar Tall, there were two apparent,
 but unconfirmed, extrajudicial killings. Professor Guillaume

 BURKINA FASO
 Sessouma, detained in December 1989 for allegedly participating
 in a coup plot, and medical student Dabo Boukary, detained
 following student demonstrations in May 1990, were reportedly
 killed while in detention by members of the paramilitary
 gendarmerie. Government officials continue to insist that the
 two escaped to Ghana. According to informed sources, however,
 both men were tortured and killed shortly after their arrest.
 The Burkinabe Movement for the Rights of Man and Peoples
 (MBDHP) continues to pressure the Government to account for
 both disappearances.
 b. Disappearance
 Initial reports indicated that a number of protestors were
 missing after an attack by supporters of President Compaore's
 Organization for Popular Democracy (ODP/MT) on a peaceful
 opposition rally and march on September 30. However, these
 allegations have never been confirmed and appear to have
 resulted from the confusion of the moment. An estimated 100
 persons were injured in the incident.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 While legally prohibited, torture and mistreatment of detainees
 have been documented for a number of years, and no known
 disciplinary action has been taken against those responsible.
 The most recent manifestation of the problem occurred in
 Bobo-Dioulasso, where those taken into custody following an
 election day riot on December 1 were tortured before being
 turned over to the police. After Burkina's two local human
 rights groups (see Section 4) protested these actions, those
 detained were released, and no further allegations of
 mistreatment were made.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Since the June adoption of the Constitution, which provides for
 the right to expeditious arraignment and access to legal
 counsel, there have been no known cases of prolonged arbitrary
 arrest or detention. The law permits detention for
 investigative purposes without charge for a maximum of 72
 hours, renewable for a single 72-hour period. In practice,
 this limitation is rarely observed, particularly in sensitive
 cases. The military code takes precedence over the civil code
 in national security cases.
 Prior to the controlled reform process, the Compaore regime
 held in custody a large number of its opponents who were
 allegedly implicated in two 1989 coup plots. In 1991 the
 Government released these persons, without ever bringing them
 to trial. Some opposition supporters were detained by
 authorities after opposition marches on September 30 and
 October 29, and after the December 1 Bobo Dioulasso riot, but
 they were released following demarches by local human rights
 organizations.
 Though some intellectuals, military officers, and former
 government officials remain in self-imposed exile abroad, a
 number have repatriated themselves since the beginning of the
 country's reform process. On September 4, a prominent exile,
 Professor Joseph Ki-Zerbo, returned to Burkina Faso after 8
 years in Senegal and France. Earlier in the year,, Captain
 Boukary Kabore returned to Burkina Faso from Ghana, following 4
 years of exile. Kabore, who headed the Koudougou military
 
 
 BURKINA FASO
 encampment, was the-only military leader to oppose then Captain
 Compaore's overthrow of CaptainThomas Sankara in 1987.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tiial.
 The.Constitution guarantees the right to public trial, access
 to counsel, and appeal. These rights are respected in the
 normal court system but do not exist in the People's
 Revolutionary Courts (TPR's), the politicized tribunals
 established following the 1983 revolution to judge former
 government offici-als on corruption and other charges. The
 TPR's were inactive after the Constitution's promulgation,
 although not 'officially abolished by the end of 1991.
 In 1991 the Government restored the civil rights of those
 convicted of political offenses. The July general amnesty,
 however, pardoned only'those convicted of political'crimes, not
 those convicted of other offenses by the country's politicized
 TPR's. At year's end, a separate process was established
 whereby these convictions could be appealed.
 Military courts exercise jurisdiction in security and political
 cases and are convened-on an ad hoc basis. They are subject to
 flexible procedures and executive influence. As a result,
 there have been growing public pressures to revise the military
 legal code.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Government authorities generally do not interfere in the daily
 lives of ordinary citizens, but monitoring of private
 correspondence or telephones does bccur in suspected national
 security cases. Under the law, homes may be searched'only
 under the authority of a warrant issued by the Minister of
 Justice. *In national security cases, however, a special law-
 permits surveillance, searches, and monitoring of telephones
 and correspondence without a warrant. Vestiges bf President
 Compaore's.old Popular Front government and its infrastructure,
 including local revolutionary committees, continued to play'an
 actiVe-role on the local scene in 1991. Though formally
 separated from the State, these organizations exercised an
 intimidating role in Burkinabe towns and villages.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although freedoms.of speech and press increased in 1991, the
 Government still employed certain tactics of intimidation to
 limit .individual.expression and criticism of government
 policies, e.g., the use of force on September 30.
 The information code of 1990 established the right of private
 publication for the first time since 1987. The code requires
 that this right be exercised with "strict respect" for cultural
 and moral values and the political orientation of Burkina
 Faso. Thus, it gives the Government wide latitude of
 interpretation. However, the four independent newspapers and
 Radio Horizon, a private radio -station in Ouagadougou, operated
 free of government intervention in 1991. L'Observateur Paalga,
 one of the new independent newspapers, soon became the
 country's largest selling newspaper. The same pattern held
 with Radio Horizon, which, within a few weeks, dominated the
 market. The official government newspaper, Sidwaya, and radio
 
 
 28
 BURKINA FASO
 station, Radio Burkina, display a lingering pro-ODP/MT bias,
 and the official press organs remain selective in their
 reporting. Yet, the presence of the independent competition,
 especially from L'Observateur, has led the official media to
 give more coverage of events sponsored by independent
 organizations and opposition parties critical of government
 policies.
 In general, foreign newspapers and magazines entered the
 country freely in 1991. Certain issues of international
 periodicals containing articles critical of the Government were
 intercepted upon reaching the country. In 1991 foreign
 journalists traveled freely, filed stories without censorship,
 and enjoyed access to government officials. There is no
 interference with international radio broadcasts.
 Although academic freedoms have been limited in the past, it
 remained unclear in 1991 whether the Constitution would protect
 academic freedoms more effectively than did previous
 legislation. The Government permitted those students released
 from detention to reenter the university.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Since early 1%90, political parties have been permitted to
 organize and hold meetings. Parties still must seek government
 permission for their rallies, although such permission was
 generally granted automatically in 1991. More than 50
 political parties existed in Burkina at the end of 1991.
 An increasing cycle of violence characterized Burkinabe
 politics prior to the boycotted presidential election, in an
 apparent attempt by hardliners to intimidate the opposition.
 Armed supporters of President Compaore and his ODP/MT attacked
 a peaceful opposition march on September 30, and widespread
 vandalism followed the police breakup of an opposition march on
 October 29. Unidentified assailants attacked the homes of
 prominent opposition leaders repeatedly in October and
 November, using Molotov cocktails and machine guns. In
 separate ambushes shortly after the election, one opposition
 leader, Clement Ouedraogo, was killed and another, Moctar Tall,
 was seriously wounded.
 Credible reports indicate the Government discharged some civil
 servants who took part in opposition activities and warned
 businessmen against supporting the opposition at the risk of
 losing government contracts and facing other harassment.
 Nonpolitical associations for business, religious, cultural,
 and other purposes exist and experience no difficulty in
 obtaining permission to meet or associate with international
 associations in their fields.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Burkina Faso is a secular state, and Islam and Christianity
 exist side by side, with about 40 percent of the population
 Muslim and about 15 percent Christian. The remainder of the
 population practices traditional African religions. Muslim and
 Christian holidays are recognized as national holidays. Social
 mobility and access to modern sector jobs are neither linked
 to, nor restricted by, religious affiliations.

 BUPRKINA FASO
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travelers within Burkina Faso are routinely stopped for
 identity checks-at.,police and military checkpoints. There is
 little restriction on foreign travel for business and tourism.
 Exit permits aredno longer required. Refugees are accepted
 freely in Burkina Faso, and attempts are made to provide for
 their care in-cooperation with the-United Nations High
 Commissioner forRefugees. At the end of 1991, there were
 approximately 186,refugees and displaced persons-in Burkina
 Faso, mainly from Chad and Liberia.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 In 1991 citizens still did not have the right to change their
 government, but pressures for change continued. The program of
 reform, carefully controlled by President Compaore-since its
 inception, suffered a setback following persistent intimidation
 of the. opposition (see Section 2.b.) and the failure of the
 Government and the opposition.to agree on modalities for the
 presidential election on December 1. 'Opposition parties sought
 a national conference with authority to govern as a
 precondition for their participation. When the'President
 demurred, the.opposition parties boycotted the legislative and
 presidential elections. Running-unopposed, President Compaore
 received 86 percent of the ballots, but 75 percent of the
 electorate abstained, from voting.
 Following the. presidential election and the subsequent
 assassination of prominent opposition leader"Clement Ouedraogo,
 President Compaore moved to compromise with the opposition. He
 delayed the legislative elections in order to allow the
 opoposition to abandon its boycott and accepted the principle
 of a "national forum of reconciliation." At the end of 1991,
 no date for the forumhad'been set. The opposition made
 government assurance of its security.a precondition "for
 continued participation in negotiations on Burkina's future.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of-Alleged Violations
 of. Human Rights
 The Government's response to demarches by local human rights
 groups has been mixed. The Government has continued to
 tolerate-the activities of the Burkinabe Movement for the
 Rights of Man and Peoples (MBDHP), and, after protests by the.
 MBDHP and the other local human rights group, it released-
 opposition supporters detained following election-day riots in
 Bobo Dioulasso. However, it has studiously ignored MBDHP
 demands to account for the deaths of Boukary Dabo and Guillaume
 Sessouma. The MBDHP'is an independent group, composed mostly
 of professionals, led by the President of the Administrative
 Chamber of the High Court. The MBDHP has organized forums on
 constitutional and human-rights issues at which discussion has
 been' impressively: free and open; it also publishes a quarterly
 journal. The government press, however, still ignores certain
 MBDHP activities, an issue the Movement raised with the.
 Minister of Information in late September. By that time, the
 MBDHP had established local chapters in 25 of Burkina's 30
 provinces-. As yet, MBDHP members do not appear to have been
 targeted for reprisal, although the car of Movement president
 Alidou Ouedraogo was burned on September 30, 1991, during an
 
 
 30
 BURKINA FASO
 attack by ODP/MT supporters on the headquarters of the National
 Convention of Progressive Patriots, an opposition party.
 In April a second human rights organization, the Association
 for the Promotion of a State of Law and Liberty (APED/L), was
 founded by a group of lawyers and professionals. Claiming to
 defend the "everyday" rights of man, APED/L has subtly
 criticized the MBDHP's antigovernment stance. The
 Association's close relations with the Government and official
 media suggest that it was established to counteract the MBDHP's
 human rights activities. The Government is rarely responsive
 to investigations by international nongovernmental
 organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination on the basis of race, religion, or ethnic origin
 is illegal under the 1991 Constitution. In practice, such
 discrimination does not occur on a wide scale. Minority ethnic
 groups are as likely to be represented in the inner circles of
 the Government as are the majority Mossi, and government
 decisions do not favor one group over another.
 In the largely rural society of Burkina Faso, women continue to
 occupy a subordinate position and face discrimination in such
 areas as education, jobs. property, and family rights. In the
 modern sector, however, women are well represented, making up
 one-fourth of the government work force, usually in lower
 paying positions. Women constitute approximately one-third of
 the total student population in the primary, secondary, and
 higher educational systems. Schools in rural areas have
 disproportionately fewer girls than schools in urban areas.
 Violence against women, especially wife beating, occurs fairly
 frequently in rural areas, less often in cities. The
 Government is attempting to educate people on the subject
 through the media. -Such cases are sometimes mediated by a
 "popular conciliation tribunal," composed of community
 representatives.
 The Government has made a particularly strong commitment to
 eradicate female genital mutilation through widespread
 educational efforts. Female circumcision still occurs in many
 rural areas, although it is becoming less common in urban
 centers. Another form of mutilation is scarring the faces of
 both boys and girls of certain ethnic groups. This custom,
 too, is gradually disappearing.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers, including civil servants, have traditionally enjoyed a
 legal right to association, which is recognized in the newly
 ratified Constitution. There are a large number of trade
 unions and five trade union federations. Although unions are
 independent of the Government, the military Government has at
 times limited their freedom of action to ensure compliance with
 government labor policy. Once the most powerful political
 force in the country, organized labor--approximately 60,000
 nonagricultural workers--lost much of its influence under the
 Sankara and Compaore military regimes. The five trade union
 federations participated in the drafting of the national
 Constitution adopted in June.
 
 
 BURKINA FASO
 The new Constitution also guarantees organized labor the right
 to strike in accordance with the laws in force. Labor unrest
 has increased as the country has embarked on an austerity
 economic adjustment program. Labor unions are free to
 affiliate internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions have the right to bargain for wages and other benefits
 both directly with employers and with industry associations.
 These negotiations are governed by minimums on wages and other
 benefits contained in the interprofessional collective
 convention and the commercial-sector collective convention. If.
 no agreement is reached, employees may exercise their right to
 strikd. Either labor or management may also refer the impasse
 in negotiations to the Government for consideration at the -
 level of the country's labor tribunals. Appeals may be pursued
 through the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court, whose
 decision is binding on both parties. Collective bargaining is
 extensive in the modern sector, although this encompasses only
 a small percentage of the.population. The Labor Code prohibits
 antiunion discrimination, and complaints about such
 discrimination are handled by Labor Ministry inspectors and are
 appealable to a tribunal in the Ministry. This is a
 functioning system which union officials feel works
 adequately. There are no export processing zones in Burkina
 Faso.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compilsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited by law.and is not practiced.
 d. 'Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Labor Code sets the minimum age for employment at 14, the
 average age'for completion of basic secondary school. However,
 the Ministry of Employment, Labor, and Social Security, which
 oversees labor standards, lacks the means to enforce this
 provision adequately, even in the small wage sector. Most
 children actually begin work at an earlier age on small, family
 subsistence farms and in the traditional apprenticeship system.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Labor Code mandates a minimum monthly wage and a maximum
 workweek of 48 hours and establishes s&fety and health
 provisions. The current minimum wage rate, which does not
 apply to the.large subsistence agriculture sector, was last set
 by the Government in. 1983,and is not adequate for an urban
 worker to support a family. Wage earners usually supplement
 their income through'reliance on the extended'family and
 subsistence agriculture. A system of government inspections
 under the Ministry of Labor and labor courts ensures that
 health and safety standards are applied in-the small industrial
 and commercial sectors, but they are not applicable in the
 subsistence agriculture sector, which involves over 85 percent
 of the population.
