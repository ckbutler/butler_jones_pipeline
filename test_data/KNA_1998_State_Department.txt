 SAINT KITTS AND NEVIS
 Saint Kitts and Nevis is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy and a member
 of the Commonwealth of Nations. The Constitution provides the smaller island of
 Nevis considerable self-government, as well as the right to secede from the Federa-
 tion in accordance with certain enumerated procedures. The Government comprises
 a prime minister, a cabinet, and a bicameral legislative assembly. The Governor
 General, appointed by the British Monarch, is the titular head of state, with largely
 ceremonial powers. After national elections in June 1995, Dr. Denzil Douglas of the
 St. Kitts and Nevis Labour Party became Prime Minister and formed a government
 with 7 of 11 seats in the legislature. The judiciary is independent.
 Security forces consist of a small police force, which includes a 50-person Special
 Services Unit that receives some light infantry training, a coast guard, and a small,
 newly formed defense force.
 The mixed economy is based on sugar cane, tourism, and light industry. Most
 commercial enterprises are privately owned, but the sugar industry and 85 percent
 of arable land are owned by a state corporation. In September Hurricane Georges
 devastated the economy, causing an estimated $445 million worth of damage. The
 1998-99 tourist season was expected to suffer significant losses, since 85 percent of
 the houses and buildings were damaged. The hurricane also damaged an estimated
 50 percent of the sugar industry. Per capita gross domestic product was about
 $6,100 in 1997.
 Human rights were generally respected. Poor prison conditions, apparent intimi-
 dation of witnesses and jurors, government restrictions on opposition access to gov-
 ernment-controlled media, and violence against women were the principal problems.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, IncludingFreedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial KIlling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extra*udicial killings in 1998.
 During the summer of 1997, police shot and killed a man who was throwing ce-
 ment blocks at neighbors and the police as a protest against a neighbor who stored
 the blocks on his property without permission. The authorities charged the police
 officer with manslaughter, but in Feb  , a court dismissed the case on grounds
 of self-defense and insufficient evidence. Prior to the incident, the police officer had
 submitted his resignation from the police force. The police officer subsequently made
 a request to reenlist but the authorities refused his request.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Law enforcement authorities abide by the constitutional prohibitions against the use
 of torture or other forms of inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. How-
 ever, there are occasional instances of excessive use of force by the police. The police
 force conducts its own internal investigation when complaints are made against
 members. In 1997, there were 40 complaints filed against the police. These com-
 plaints resulted in 7 disciplinary proceedings, 2 civil proceedings, 12 warnings, 2
 cases pending trial, 3 cases under inquiry, 6 cases found false, and 8 cases with no
 further action. Family members, attorneys, and clergy are permitted to visit detain-
 ees regularly.
 Prison conditions are poor. Saint Kitt's prison was built in 1947. Prisoners suffer
 from severe overcrowding, poor food, and lax security. These conditions have con-
 tributed to riots in the past, although none has occurred since 1994. There are 128
 prisoners and 55 prison officials.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention, and this provision is respected in practice. The law requires that
 persons detained be charged within 48 hours or be released. If charged, the police
 must bring a detainee before a court within 72 hours.
 There were no reported cases of exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the judiciary is highly regarded. However,- intimidation of witnesses and
 potential intimidation of jurors in high-profile drug-related cases threatened this
 traditional independence. The Government is exploring the possibility of a program
 to protect witnesses, judges, and jurors through the Caribbean Community
 (Caricom).
 The court system comprises one high court and four magistrate's courts at the
 local level, with the right of appeal to the- Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal. Final
 appeal may be made to the Privy Council in the United Kingdom. There are no mili-
 tary or political courts. Free legal assistance is available for indigent defendants in
 capital cases only.
 The Constitution provides that every person accused of a crime must receive a
 fair, speedy, and public trial, and these requirements are generally observed. At
 year's end, 35 of the 128 prisoners were being held on "remand" (detention pending
 trial or further court action).
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 were no reports of arbitrary government or police interference in the private lives
 of individuals. The law requires judicially issued warrants to search private homes.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and, for the most part, the authorities respected these provisions in
 practice. The Government owns the only radio and television station on St. Kitts.
 A Trinidadian company manages it; however, the Government appoints three of its
 five board members. There is a religious television station and a privately owned
 radio station on Nevis.
 St. Kitts and Nevis does not have a daily newspaper, each of the major political
 parties publishes a weekly or biweekly newspaper. A third weekly newspaper is
 nonpartisan. The papers are free to criticize the Government and do so regularly
 and vigorously. International news publications are readily available.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly. Political parties organized demonstrations, rallies,
 and public meetings during the 1995 election campaign without significant govern-
 
 
 763
 ment interference. Many meetings sponsored by the Nevis Island administration
 and opposition parties were held in Nevis to discuss the secession question.
 The Constitution provides for the right of association, and the Government re-
 spects this right in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for the free exercise of religion,
 and religious practices are not restricted. All groups are free to maintain links with
 coreligionists in other countries.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict travel within or departure from the
 country. However, following Hurricane Georges in September, the Government de-
 clared a state of emergency and instituted a curfew to avoid looting during the pe-
 riod of electrical power loss.
 No formal government policy toward refugee or asylum requests exists. The issue
 of provision of first asylum did not arise. There were no reports of forced expulsion
 of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status; however, government practice re-
 mains undefined.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens are free to change their government by peaceful means. A vigorous
 multiparty political system exists in which political parties are free to conduct their
 activities. Periodic elections are held in which all citizens 18 years of age and older
 may register and vote by secret ballot. According to the Constitution, the next gen-
 eral elections must take place by June 2000.
 The Legislative Assembly has 11 elected seats; 8 for St. Kitts and 3 for Nevis.
 The Government holds 7 of the 11 seats; opposition parties hold the other 4. In the
 June 1995 elections, Dr. Douglas' St. Kitts and Nevis Labour Party won seven of
 eight seats at stake in St. Kitts with 60 percent of the popular vote, and Douglas
 became Prime Minister. The People's Action Movement (PAM), the former ruling
 party, took only one seat, but received 40 percent of the vote. The Concerned Citi-
 zens Movement won two of the three Nevis seats; the Nevis Reformation Party won
 the remaining one. The island of Nevis has considerable self-government and its
 own legislature.
 In accordance with its rights under the Constitution, the Nevis Island Assembly
 in 1996 initiated steps towards secession from the Federation, the most recent being
 a referendum in August. However, the referendum failed to secure the two-thirds
 majority required for secession. Prior to the referendum, a Caricom-initiated Con-
 stitutional Review Commission submitted a report that recommended an alternative
 olitical structure-a presidential system with separate elected legislatures for
 aint Kitts and for Nevis. These recommendations are under review by both islands.
 All parties involved adhered-to constitutional procedures, and no acts of violence
 were reported in counection with the secession question.
 Although the Constitutionprohibits discriminatioon n grounds of political opinion
 or affiliation, the opposition PAM alleges widespread employment discrimination by
 the St. Kitta and Nevis Labour Party against public sector employment of persons
 perceived to be opposition supporters. PAM alleges that the ruling party dismissed
 or demoted many P AM supporters from their jobs in order to replace them with its
 own supporters. The Government acknowledged that it had withheld pension bene-
 fits from opposition members of Parliament voted out of office and entitled to such
 benefits. However, all pension benefits have since been paid with the exception of
 those of the former Minister of Women's Affairs.
 There are no impediments in law or in practice to the participation of women in
 leadership roles in government or political parties. There are no women in the Cabi-
 net. However, 2 of 3 senators are women, 1 of 2 magistrates is a woman, the court
 registrar is a woman, and 5 of 9 permanent secretaries are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no governmental restrictions, no local human rights groups have
 been formed. There were no requests for investigations or visits by international
 human rights groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on grounds of race, place of origin, birth
 out of wedlock, political opinion or affiliation, color, sex, or creed, and the Govern-
 ment generally respects these provisions in practice.
 Wome-r  According to a government offical, violence against women is a problem,
 but many women are reluctant to file complaints or pursue them in the courts. De-
 
 
 764
 spite this reluctance, there were publicly reported cases of both domestic violence
 and rape, and a few convictions. There is no domestic violence legislation.
 The role of women in society is not restricted by law but is circumscribed by cul-
 ture and tradition. There is no overt societal discrimination against women in em-
 ployment, although sectoral analyses suggest that women do not yet occupy as many
 senior positions as men. The Bureau of Women's Affairs, under the Ministry of
 Health and Women's Affairs, is active in promoting change in the areas of domestic
 violence, poverty, institutional mechanisms to advance the status of women, health,
 and leadership positions for women. Since 1997 the Bureau has also been active in
 training the police and school guidance counselors on issues of domestic violence,
 sexual crimes, and child abuse.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and welfare and has
 incorporated most of the provisions of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the
 Child into domestic legislation.
 People-With Disabilities.-Although there is no legislation to protect the disabled
 or to mandate accessibility for them, the Government and the Constitution prohibit
 discrimination in employment, education, and other state services.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of all work-
 ers to form and belong to trade unions. The law permits the police, civil service, and
 other organizations to have associations which serve as unions. The major labor
 union, the St. Kitts Trades and Labour Union, is affiliated with the St. Kitts and
 Nevis Labour Party and is active in all-sectors of the economy. There is also an
 independent teachers' union, a union representing dockworkers in the capital city,
 and two taxi drivers' associations.
 The right to strike, while not specified by law, is well established and respected
 in practice. There were no major strikes during the year.
 Unions are free to form federations or confederations and to affiliate with inter-
 national organizations. The islands' unions maintain a variety of international ties.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Labor unions are free to orga-
 nize and to negotiate for better wages and benefits for union members. The law pro-
 hibits antiunion discrimination but does not require employers found guilty to rehire
 employees fired due to antiunion discrimination. However, the employer must pay
 lost wages and arrange for severance pay. There is no legislation governing the or-
 ganization and representation of workers, and employers are not legally bound to
 recognize a union, but in practice employers do so if a majority of workers polled
 wish to organize. Collective bargaining takes place on a workplace by workplace
 basis, not industrywide. A Labor Commission mediates all types of disputes between
 labor and management on an ad hoc basis. In practice, however, few disputes actu-
 ally go to the Commission for resolution. If neither the Commission nor the Minister
 of Labor can resolve the dispute, legislation allows for a case to be brought before
 a civil court. '
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution forbids slavery
 and forced labor, and they do not occur in practice. While neither the Constitution
 nor law specifically addresses bonded labor, it has not been a problem in practice.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The 1966
 Employment of Children Ordinance outlaws slavery, servitude, and forced labor,
 and prescribes the minimum legal working age, which is 14 years. Although the law
 does not specifically address bonded labor (see Section 6.c.), it has not been a prob-
 lem in practice. The Labor Ministry relies heavily on school truant officers and the
 community affairs division to monitor compliance, which they do effectively. The law
 mandates compulsory education up to the age of 16.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-A 1984 law,'updated in 1994, establishes mini-
 mum wage rates for various categories of workers, such as domestic servants, retail
 employees, casino workers, and skilled workers. The minimum wage varies from
 $56.18 (EC$ 150) per week for full-time domestic workers to $74.91 (EC$ 200) per
 week for skilled workers. These provide an adequate, though Spartan, living for a
 wage earner and family; many workers supplement wages by keeping small animals
 such as goats and chickens. The Labor Commission undertakes regular wage inspec-
 tions and special investigations when it receives complaints; it requires employers
 found in violation to pay back wages.
 The law provides for a 40- to 44-hour workweek, but the common practice is 40
 hours in 5 days. Although not required by law, workers receive at least one 24-hour
 rest period per week. The law provides that workers receive a minimum annual va-
 cation of 14 working days. While there are no specific health and safety regulations,
 the Factories Law provides general health and safety guidance to Labor Ministry
 
 
 765
 inspectors. The Labor Commission settles disputes over safety conditions. Workers
 have the right to report unsafe work environments without jeopardy to continued
 employment; inspectors then investigate such claims.
