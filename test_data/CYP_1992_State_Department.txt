 CYPRUS
 Cyprus has been divided since the Turkish military intervention of 1974, following
 a coup d'etat directed from Greece. Since then, the southern part of the country has
 been under the control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus, and the north-
 ern nart under an autonomous Turkish Cypriot administration supported by the
 
 
 749
 presence of Turkish troops. In 1983 that administration proclaimed itself the "'urk-
 ish Republic of Northern Cyprus" (RNC'), which is recognized only by Turkey.
 The internal political systems of the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot
 administration are democratic, based on free elections, and in general accord basic
 human rights to their opulations both in law and in practice. However, the "TRNC*
 restricts the freedom of Trkish Cypriots to travel to the Republic of Cyprus.
 Total military expenditures for the Republic of Cyprus for 1989, the last year for
 which the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency conducted a detailed analy-
 sis, were $41 million. There is no indication that efforts will be made to reduce
 these expenditures in the near future. Expenditure figures for the "rRNC" were not
 available.
 Both Cypriot economies are based on free enterprise, private initiative, and the
 right to property. The Greek Cypriot economy has prospered in recent years, par-
 ticularly in the tourism and manufacturing sectors and continued to be strong in
 1992. The economy in the Turkish Cypriot area, closely linked to that of Turkey,
 remained depressed in 1992, although a resurgence in tourism was evident in Au-
 gust and September.
 Conflict between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities during the 1963-
 74 period, followed in 1974 by the abortive Greek Cypriot coup and subsequent
 Turkish intervention, resulted in the uprooting of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cyp-
 riots from the northern and southern parts of the island, respectively. The resultant
 loss of lives, homes, and livelihoods has led to continuing charges of human rights
 violations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of persons abducted, secretly arrested,
 or held in clandestine detention.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Both the Cyprus Constitution and the basic document governing the Turkish Cyp-
 riot community specifically prohibit torture. Freedom from cruel, inhuman, or de-
 grading treatment or punishment is provided for in law and generally respected in
 practice in both communities. However, 1992 saw several allegations of brutality in
 interrogations leveled against the Greek Cypriot police in Limassol and Nicosia.
 Most of these allegations did not lead to prosecution because the detainees involved
 declined to press charges. A special commission established to investigate the allega-
 tions continues its work, and the Government appears determined to pursue the re-
 maining case.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Laws providing for freedom from arbi-
 trary arrest and detention are respected in practice by the Government of Cyprus
 and Turkish Cypriot authorities. Arrest warrants, issued b judges, are required. No
 one may be held for more than 1 day for investigation of a crime without referral
 of the case to the courts for extension of the period of detention. Most periods of
 investigative detention do not exceed 8 to 10 days before formal charges are filed.
 Attorneys have free access to detainees, and bail is allowed. Exile is specifically pro-
 hibited by the Cyprus Constitution and by the basic document governin the  rk-
 ishCypriot community.
 e.Denial of Fair Public Tria.--Cyprus inherited many elements of its legal sys-
 tem from the British legal tradition, including the p resumption of innocence, the
 right to due process, and the right to ap peal.n both parts of Cyprus, fair public
 tril is provided for in law and accorded in practice. The judiciary is independent
 of executive or military control. Defendants have the right to be present at their
 trials, to be represented by counsel (at government expense for those who cannot
 afford one), to confront wititesses, and to present evidence in their own defense.
 Cases are generally tried before a judge or panel of judges, although a request for
 a jury trial is usually granted. There are no special courts to deal with security or
 political offenses.
 On the Turkish Cypriot side, civilians deemed to have violated military zones are
 subject to trial in a military court. These courts consist of one military and two civil-
 ian judges and a civilian prosecutor. Defendants in military courts have all the due
 process rights available in civilian courts. There were no trials of civilians in mili-
 tarycourts in 1992.
 There are no political prisoners in Cyprus.
 f. Arbitrary interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Both
 the Cy orus Constitution and the basic document governing the Turkish Cypriot
 
 
 750
 community include provisions protecting the individual against arbitrary inter-
 ference by the authorities. A judicial warrant is required, for example, for a police
 official to enter a private residence. Abuses of privacy run counter to the democratic
 traditions of both communities. Some Turkish Cypriots, however, continue to com-
 plain that mail coming through the Republic of Cyprus postal system is delayed or
 not delivered.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-These rights are provided for by law and are
 freely practiced throughout the island. The press is free and represents the entire
 political spectrum. There is no press censorship. The launching of a private tele-
 vision channel ended the Greek Cypriot authorities' monopoly control over local tele-
 vision broadcasting. Several privately owned radio stations have been in operation
 since 1990. Turkish Cypriot authorities retain monopoly control over both radio and
 television. Cable services offering several international broadcasts are available
 throughout the island. In addition, the proliferation of party and independent news-
 papers and periodicals in both communities enables ideas and arguments to cir-
 culate freely. Opposition papers on both sides of the island frequently criticize the
 authorities.
 b. Frelom of Peaceful Assembly and Associaton.-The freedom to associate, orga-
 nize, and hold meetings is protected by law and respected in practice.
 c. Freedom . Religion.- Freedom of religion is respected in Cyprus. In the south,
 the vast majority of the population is Greek Orthodox; in the north, Sunni Muslim.
 The Greek Orthodox Church in the south has the character of a state institution;
 all its activities and holdings are exempt from taxation. Missionaries have the legal
 right to proselytize in both communities, although both Greek Cypriot and Turkish
 Cypriot authorities closely monitor missionary activities.
 Approximately 300 Turkish Cypriots who still live in the south of the island are
 allowed to practice their religion freely. In the north, non-Muslims include approxi-
 mately 550 Greek Cypriots, over 300 Christian Maronites, and some foreign resi-
 dents-all of whom are free to practice their religions.
 A law passed on January 9, 1992, allows alternative service for those Greek Cyp-
 riots who conscientiously object to military service on religious grounds: they may
 select either 34 months of unarmed military service or 42 months of Civil Defense
 Force or social services, compared to 26 months of military service. Turkish Cypriot
 conscientious objectors have no alternative to military service and face imprison-
 ment if they refuse to serve.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Turkish and Greek Cypriots enjoy general freedom of movement within
 their respective areas. However, Turkish Cypriot authorities strictly regulate travel
 into the Turkish Cypriot area and from that area into the south. Turkish Cypriots
 who apply for permission to visit the south are required to justify their applications
 with (ormal invitations to events. Applicants are sometimes not given a reply until
 the last minute, and many are refused. Those who are denied permission are rarely
 t en an official reason. Turkish Cypriot authorities also generally bar Greeks,
 reek Cypriots, and even third-country nationals with Greek or Armenian sur-
 names from entering the north. The applications of Greek Cypriot residents of en-
 claves in the north to visit the south are usually granted, but the applicants must
 return within a designated period or risk losing their right to return, as well as
 their property. Turkish Cypriot authorities usually deny applications by Greek Cyp-
 riots to visit relatives in the north.
 Foreigners coming from the south must obtain Turkish Cypriot permission to
 enter the north. The Government of Cyprus discourages travel by Greek Cypriots
 to the north if it involves filling out entry cards issued by the 'Turkish Republic
 of Northern Cyprus." Occasional demonstrations by Greek Cypriot organizations at
 the Ledra Palace checkpoint have effectively prevented crossings, with the acquies-
 cence of the Greek Cypriot police. The Government of Cyprus has barred travel to
 the north by foreigners intending to depart the island from the Turkish Cypriot
 area. At the same time, it bars entry into the Greek Cypriot area by foreigners who
 have entered Cyprus from the north.
 The right to travel abroad and to emigrate is observed, although persons facing
 military service or legal action in either part of Cyprus may not travel without a
 cific permission. Turkish Cypriots have difficulty traveling to some countries be-
 cause travel documents issued by the Turkish Cypriot authorities are not generally
 recognized and they normally are not granted passports by the Greek Cypriot au-
 thorities. They are usually able to travel on Turkish passports provided by means
 of a soecial arrangement with Turkey. Citizens may reoatriate freely.
 
 
 751
 The Government of Cyprus does not accept third-country refugees for resettlement
 in Cyprus on the grounds that it already has enough responsibilities in caring for
 the Greek Cypriots displaced after the 1974 Turkish intervention. The Government
 of Cyprus, however has granted relatively large numbers of Lebanese citizens the
 right to reside on tile island without granting them formal refugee status. The Cy-
 rus Government refers all refugee and asylum claimants to the United Nations
 Nigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and then expects UNHCR to process
 their applications and ensure their departure from Cyprus. The Cyprus Government
 has been cooperative in extending residency permission to those under consideration
 by UNHCR, and they do not generally repatriate claimants to their home country.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Both the Government of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot administration have
 lively multiparty political systems. Parties compete for popular support actively and
 without restriction. Suffrage is universal and elections are heldby secret ballot.
 Elections for the office of President of the #Republic of Cyprus are held every 5 years
 and for the House of Representatives every 5 years or less.
 The Turkish Cypriots elect a leader and a representative body every 5 years or
 less. Such elections were last held in 1990. Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in
 the north-the latter having chosen before independence in 1960 to be regarded as
 members of the Greek Cypriot community-are barred by law from participating in
 Turkish Cypriot elections but elect their own village officials. They are eligible to
 vote in Greek Cypriot elections but must travel to the south in order to exercise that
 right.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are organizations in both parts of the island that consider themselves
 human    hts groups, but all appear to be primarily concerned with alleged viola-
 tions of the rights of members of their community by the other community. There
 are no restrictions preventing the formation of human rights groups in either part
 of the island.
 Representatives of international human rights organizations have access to both
 the south and the north.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Both the Government of Cyprus and the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus"
 have constitutional or legal bars against discrimination. Food, shelter, education,
 and health care are usually available to members of both communities and the tiny
 Maronite, Armenian, and Latin minorities, regardless of race, religion, ethnic back-
 ground, or political opinion.
 Nevertheless, there are continuing complaints that Turkish Cypriot restrictions on
 housing and education impair thewelfare of minorities in the north: Greek Cypriots
 living in the north are unable to change their housing, and Greek Cypriot schools
 in the north have their educational materials rigorous y screened by Turkish Cyp-
 riot authorities. The U.N. Secretary General, in his December 1 report to the Secu-
 rity Council on U.N. operations in Cyprus, said that Turkish Cypriot authorities
 took an inordinate time to review textbooks for Greek Cypriot elementary schools
 in the north and refused 35 out of 89 titles on the grounds that they contained ma-
 terial considered offensive to Turkish Cypriots. U.N. officials say that they receive
 occasional complaints of human rights violations from Turkish Cypriots living in the
 south who claim that they are unable to speak with U.N. officials unless a police
 officer is present.
 The Cyprus Red Cross sends supplies weekly to Greek Cypriots remaining in the
 north; this effort is coordinated by United Nations Forces in Cyprus (UNFICYP) and
 financed largely by the United States. UNFICYP monitors the welfare of the Greek
 Cypriots and Mamnites in the north, as well as that of the Turkish Cypriots in the
 south.
 Throughout Cyprus, women generally have the same legal status as men. How-
 ever, women's groups in the north contend that the current law regulating divorce
 discriminates against women. In the north, legal provisions requiring equal pay for
 men and women performing the same job are effectively enforced. In the south, gov-
 ernment workers receive equal pay for equal work, regardless of sex. In 1989 a law
 was passed requiring equality of pay between men and women working in the pri-
 vate sector. The 3-year grace period for full implementation expired in October 1992,
 and private employers, according to published accounts, are confident that they are
 in full compliance. Many women work in occupations held almost exclusively by
 women, so exact wage comparisons between men and women may not be possible.
 
 
 752
 Social taboos, traditions, and family honor shroud incidents of wife and family
 abuse in Cyprus. Moreover, it is understood that police files on incidents of domestic
 violence are sometimes destroyed under the pretext that these are "personal mat-
 ters." Nevertheless, the Crisis Center for Family Violence, a private organization in
 the south, has indicated that the number of reported domestic abuse cases, includ-
 ing wife beating, is on the rise. The Center, as well as several other support groups,
 was established in part to draw public attention to this problem and to encourage
 government action in dealing with it. There is no similar center in the north. Nei-
 ther the Government of Cyprus nor the Turkish Cypriot authorities have made pro-
 nouncements or taken specific actions on this issue.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers in both the north and the south, except
 for members of the police and military forces, have the legal right to form and join
 trade unions of their own choosing without prior authorization. In 1990 the Govern-
 ment of Cyprus amended its trade union laws to allow trade unions to elect their
 leaders regardless of whether they are union members--a previous source of conten-
 tion with the International Labor Organization (ILO).
 More than 90 percent of Greek Cypriot workers and 40 to 50 percent of Turkish
 Cypriot workers belong to independent trade unions. Union officials in the north,
 however, allege that the ruling party has tried to weaken public sector unions by
 supporting establishment of rival unions and have taken their complaints to the
 IW. In both communities, trade unions freely and regularly take stands on public
 policy issues affecting workers and maintain their independence from the Govern-
 ment, although most are closely aligned with political parties.
 All Cypriot workers have the right to strike. There were no significant strikes in
 1992. Strikes usually are of short duration. Both the Government of Cyprus and the
 Turkish Cypriot authorities have the power to curtail strikes in what they deem to
 be "essential services." At its 1992 meeting, the ILO Committee of Experts reiter-
 ated its concern that Cypriot legislation in this area does not conform to ILO Con-
 vention 87 on freedom of association and noted that the Government of Cyprus has
 reported that this legislation is being reexamined.
 Unions in both parts of Cyprus freely take part in international meetings. Most
 unions are affiliated either with the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions or with the Communist-dominated World Federation of Trade Unions. Labor
 unions, more than most other organizations on Cyprus, attempt to maintain contact
 and cooperation across the dividing line, but this remains limited.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-By law, trade unions and con-
 federations are free to organize and to bargain collectively in both parts of Cyprus.
 This is observed in practice in the south, and most wages and benefits are set by
 freely bargained collective agreements. In the north, wage levels in many sectors are
 largely pegged to the annual change in the minimum wage, set by a special commis-
 sion comprised of five representatives each from organized labor, the employers, and
 the authorities. Union leaders contend that private sector employers are able to dis-
 courage union activity because enforcement is weak and penalties for antiunion
 practices are minimal. In both the north and the south, parties to a dispute may
 request mediation by the authorities. In both sectors, legislation prohibiting dismis-
 sal for participation in trade union activity is effectively enforced.
 Small export processing zones exist in Larnaca port in the south and Famagusta
 in the north, but the laws governing working conditions and actual practice are uni-
 form throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law, and no instances of it were reported.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Government of Cyprus has
 set the minimum age for employment of children in an "industrial undertaking" at
 age 16. In the north, the age is 15. The law is effectively enforced in both sectors
 by government labor inspectors.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is a legislated minimum wage in the
 south which is renewed every year and covers clerks, salespersons, nursery assist-
 ants, practical nurses, and hairdressers. The legislated minimum wage is not suffi-
 cient to provide an adequate living for a worker and family. All other occupations
 are covered under collective bargaining agreements between trade unions and em-
 ployers within the same economic sector, and the minimum wages set in these
 agreements are significantly higher than the legislated minimum wage. The legis-
 lated minimum wage in the north, while more broadly applicable and renewed an-
 nually after tripartite negotiations, would not be adequate to support a worker and
 family. Most workers earn more than the minimum wage.
 
 
 753
 The Government of Cyprus has set 40 hours as the standard workweek except for
 shop workers and drivers, whose legal workweek is 42 hours. In 1992, however,
 Greek Cypriot unions won concessions that will reduce the workweek by one-half
 hour per year until 1997 when a 38-hour workweek will be in place for most sectors
 of the economy. In the north, the standard workweek is 38 hours in the winter and
 36 in the summer. These laws are effectively enforced by government labor inspec-
 tors.
 Although in both sectors standards are not equivalent to those in Western indus-
 trialized countries, occupational safety and health regulations are administered ef-
 fectively. In both sectors, a factory inspector receives and processes complaints and
 inspects businesses in order to ensure that occupational safety laws are observed.
 Workers who file complaints are protected by law and the court system in the Greek
 Cypriot sector but not in the Turkish Cypriot sector. In both sectors, however, work-
 ers risk losing their jobs if they unilaterally remove themselves from a position
 which they believe endangers their health.
