 COMOROS
 The Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros comprises three
 islands of the Comoros Archipelago, located in the Mozambique
 Channel between East Africa and Madagascar. The fourth
 island, Mayotte, is still governed by France. Comoros
 unilaterally declared its independence from France in 1975.
 The first president, Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane, was overthrown
 shortly after independence in a mercenary-led coup but
 regained power in 1978 when mercenaries ousted the
 increasingly repressive and xenophobic regime of Ali Soilih.
 Abdallah, who was reelected unopposed for a second 6-year term
 in 1984, is the dominant political personality in the country.
 Traditional social and economic institutions still influence
 the country's political development. Village notables and
 religious leaders dominate local politics.
 A mercenary force of about 30 expatriates continues to train
 and lead the Presidential Guard, the best-equipped security
 force in the islands. French technical assistance is provided
 to the small Comorian armed forces and the gendarmerie. On
 November 30, 1987, a group of dissidents and Comorian former
 members of the Presidential Guard unsuccessfully tried to
 capture a Guard camp in an apparent coup attempt. Three
 attackers were killed and a number arrested by the
 Presidential Guard in the aftermath.
 Agriculture dominates the economy, but, with a population of
 450,000 likely to double by the year 2000, Comoros is running
 out of arable land, and soil erosion on the steep volcanic
 slopes is an increasing problem. Revenues from the export of
 vanilla, essence of ylang ylang, and cloves continue to fall,
 covering the costs of an ever smaller portion of imports.
 There are virtually no industries, port facilities are
 inadequate, and highway and communications infrastructure is
 limited. Three major families, of which the President's is
 one, control most of the import-export business. Comoros is
 part of the French franc monetary zone. Government expenses
 far exceed revenues, and the country depends heavily on France
 for budgetary support and technical assistance. Discussions
 are under way with the World Bank about a structural
 adjustment program.
 A number of significant restrictions on human rights continued
 in 1988, especially in the aftermath of the November 1987 coup
 attempt. At the end of 1988, none of an estimated 40 persons
 initially detained in the attempt (the Government admits to 5
 still in detention) had been brought to trial. Also, the
 Government had not responded to charges that several persons
 had been tortured to death. One of the leaders of a 1985 coup
 attempt was released from prison in March, while eight or nine
 members of the Presidential Guard remained incarcerated from
 that attempt. Also in March, four persons were arrested on
 Moheli after distributing a leaflet complaining about the
 central Government's neglect of their island, the smallest and
 least developed of the four. Charges were never formally
 brought against them, and they were released in June.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killing in 1988.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance in 1988.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were reports that at least three persons involved in the
 November 1987 coup attempt died of torture. The Government
 acknowledged that there had been three deaths, but at the end
 of 1988 had provided no explanation of the circumstances
 causing them.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Government has detained.persons incommunicado in the past,
 especially in security cases. The number of arbitrary arrests
 and detentions, mainly by the Presidential Guard, declined in
 1988 from levels in earlier years. Following the November
 1987 coup attempt, as many as 40 people were detained, but
 most have been released without charge. The Government admits
 there are five persons in prison awaiting trial, but it is
 possible that several others may still be held incommunicado
 by the Presidential Guard.
 In regular criminal cases, a person may not be detained more
 than 48 hours without being charged. This is generally
 followed in practice. However, there is apparently no such
 limit in cases involving national security.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for the equality of all citizens
 before the law and the right of all accusgd to defense
 counsel. The Comorian legal system applies Islamic law and an
 inherited French legal code. French and Comorian experts are
 drafting a new consolidated legal code. Most disputes are
 settled by village elders or by a civil court of first
 instance. In regular civil and criminal cases, the judiciary
 is independent, and trials are public.
 There was no indication at the end of 1988 when those detained
 after the 1987 coup attempt would be brought to trial. The
 1986 and 1987 trials resulting from the 1985 coup attempt were
 criticized as unfair by human rights groups.
 With the release from prison in March of one of the leaders of
 the outlawed Comorian Democratic Front, one civilian and eight
 or nine members of the Presidential Guard involved with the
 1985 coup attempt remained in prison. President Abdallah
 considers Moustoifa Said Cheikh, the Secretary General of the
 Front, to be the only political prisoner in the country.

 COMOROS
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for the inviolability of home and
 property. There were no known cases of arbitrary interference
 with privacy in 1988. There is no regular, systematic
 interference with correspondence. However, some members of
 the opposition believe that their mail may be screened by the
 Presidential Guard.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of expression, of
 thought, and of conscience. Comorians discuss and criticize
 the Government and its leading personalities openly in some
 situations. For example, social occasions, such as the
 traditional lavish, extended weddings and funerals of
 prominent Comorians, are used as opportunities to discuss
 political topics. The so-called tribune libre, an informal
 private forum for discussion of political, economic, social,
 and other issues, has been in existence for several years.
 Meetings are by invitation, but all subjects are covered, and
 the existence of the group is known and tolerated by the
 Government. Attendees include figures from both the public
 and private sectors.
 However, the Government seeks to restrict public criticism of
 its performance. In March four individuals were arrested on
 Moheli, the smallest and poorest island, for distributing a
 leaflet accusing the central Government of neglecting their
 island. No charges were ever filed against them, and they
 were released in June, but the three who worked for the
 Government were fired from their jobs.
 The local news media consist of the government-owned radio
 station and a semi-independent bimonthly newspaper, which
 generally avoid criticism of the Government when covering
 domestic events. However, the Paris-based Indian Ocean
 Newsletter, which is often critical of the Comoros, and the
 Comorian Letter, which is published by members of the Comorian
 opposition in Paris, generally arrive unhindered through the
 international mail. Other foreign journals and newspapers are
 available, as are books from abroad.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution states that freedom of association is
 guaranteed. In practice, however, Comorians are circumspect
 about organizing public political gatherings. On several
 occasions in 1988, Comorians expressed their opinion by
 boycotting mass rallies the Government sought to organize to
 discuss constitutional changes.
 Various cultural, musical, and community development
 associations exist throughout the country. The Chamber of
 Commerce and Industry, which is controlled largely by the
 Government, belongs to and participates in the activities of
 regional and international chambers of commerce.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.

 COMOROS
 c. Freedom of Religion
 An overwhelming majority of the population is Muslim. The
 Constitution holds Islam to be the "wellspring of the
 principles and rules which guide the State and its
 institutions." However, the State upholds the right of
 non-Muslims to practice their faith. There are churches for
 the small Protestant and Catholic populations. Christian
 missionaries work in local hospitals and schools, but they are
 not allowed to proselytize.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement within the Comoros and travel abroad for citizens and
 foreigners is not restricted. Members of the large Comorian
 community abroad, concentrated in France, oppose the
 Government, but in 1988 there was no evidence that those
 returning to the Comoros were subjected to governmental
 reprisals.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The current one-party political system provides no mechanism
 for citizens to change their government legally and
 peacefully. President Ahmed Abdallah is the single most
 important factor in Comorian politics and either directly or
 indirectly controls all three branches of the Government and
 makes all the key decisions. He commands the personal loyalty
 of the Presidential Guard, and his position is buttressed both
 by tradition and by his own personal wealth. Although
 Abdallah is the preponderant figure in politics, the senior
 notables, or elders, of all three islands constitute somethipg
 of a brake on his authority. Following the 1987 coup attempt,
 for example, he met with a large delegation of the elders of
 Grande Comore concerning the situation.
 In recent years, the President's authority has been increased
 through several constitutional changes, e.g., eliminating the
 post of prime minister and appointing rather than electing
 governors of the islands. In 1988 there was considerable
 public discussion about modifying the Constitution again,
 namely, to restore the post of prime minister, to increase the
 power of the governors, to make the Federal Assembly president
 the designated successor to the president, and possibly to
 alter the provision which restricts the president to two
 6-year terms.
 In the 1987 National Assembly elections, opposition candidates
 were permitted to run, but there was widespread fraud on
 election day, and the ruling United Progress Party (UPP) won
 41 of 42 seats. In 1988 an opposition candidate won the
 by-election to fill the remaining vacant seat in the
 Assembly. A "responsible opposition" composed of about 12
 former senior officials, including the last prime minister, is
 tolerated by the Government. The group's January call on the
 President to discuss the aftermath of the November 1987 coup
 attempt was well publicized by the local media.
 Comoros continues to claim sovereignty over Mayotte, which did
 not join the other islands in declaring independence from
 France in 1975. The results of a 1977 referendum on the
 status of Mayotte--overwhelmingly in favor of remaining with
 France--has never been accepted by the Comorian Government.
 
 
 COMOROS
 The French have indefinitely postponed a new referendum. In
 the June 1988 French parliamentary elections, 98 percent of
 the voters on Mayotte supported candidates advocating closer
 ties to France, while less than 2 percent favored candidates
 advocating independence or reunification with the Comoros.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Since 1986, when Comorian government officials met with an
 Amnesty International (AI) delegation, the Government has not
 responded to requests from human rights organizations. For
 example, the Government, as far as is known, has not responded
 to AI'r call for an investigation regarding the alleged use of
 torture on some detainees held after the 1987 coup attempt.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The constitutional recognition of Islam's special status
 formalizes the deeply held commitment of most Comorians to an
 Islamic world view. The society respects authority based on
 inheritance; age, wealth, and religious leadership.
 The"Constitution formally provides for the equality of
 citizens regardless of race, sex, or religion. Women have the
 right to vote and to participate, in theory, in the political
 process as candidates. However, tradition has been a powerful
 force in discouraging women from direct participation in
 politics. Women are neither veiled nor limited, in terms of
 employment, to minor civil service posts. Change in the
 status of women is most evident in the major towns.
 Nevertheless, within Comorian society, men have the dominant
 role.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution allows workers to form unions and to strike.
 However, farming on small landholdings, subsistence fishing,
 and petty commerce make up the daily activity of most of the
 population. Hence the wage labor force is very small, and
 there are no formally constituted, legally recognized unions
 at present. There have been sporadic groupings of workers in
 various sectors (dockers, taxi drivers) who have formed
 temporary associations for presenting specific grievances, but
 these have tended to dissolve after their demands were met.
 Public service employees are not subject to the Labor Code,
 but are granted the right to organize in civil service
 legislation. There is an active teachers' association. The
 increasing scarcity of jobs is also a real restraint on labor
 complaints, organizational activities, and formal strikes.
 The Government's inability to pay wages and salaries on
 schedule sometimes results in work slowdowns, absenteeism, and
 informal, peaceful protests.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The absence of formal unions does not mean that collective
 bargaining does not exist. There are various informal
 collective conventions between workers and employers.
 
 
 79
 COMOROS
 There are no export processing zones in the Comoros. Labor
 legislation is applied uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in the Comoros.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment of children is 15. This is
 generally respected. Child labor is not an issue due to the
 lack of employment opportunities for adolescents and young
 adults. Children do help in family units in the large
 subsistence sector. Young workers are active as apprentices
 in jewelry-making and woodcarving.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Most of Comoros' inhabitants make their living from
 subsistence farming and fishing. There is virtually no
 industrialization or factory activity. Jobs in the small
 modern economy are scarce, and accordingly wages are low.
 Salaried workers are found in port activities, public
 transport, three or four large companies engaged in vanilla
 processing, yleng-ylang distillation and baking, some
 remaining colonial-era plantations, as well as in a soda
 bottling plant, a commercial bank, a soap factory, and a shirt
 factory. The salaried sector numbers fewer than a thousand
 workers. The currently accepted minimum wage is approximately
 $50 per month, which is barely adequate to cover basic human
 needs. However, the hours of work in any category rarely
 exceed 35 hours per week.
