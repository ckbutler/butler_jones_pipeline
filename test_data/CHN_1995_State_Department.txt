 CHINA
 The People's Republic of China (PRC) is an authoritarian state in which the Chi-
 nese Communist Party (CCP) is the paramount source of power. At the national and*
 regional levels, party members hold almost all top civilian, police, and military posi-
 tions. Retired senior leaders retain considerable power, but the top leadership an-
 nounced in mid-1995 that ultimate authority had been passed to the younger gen-
 eration of Communist Party leaders that makes up the 21-member Politburo. Eco-
 nomic decentralization has increased the authority of regional officials. Socialism
 continues to provide the ideological underpinning of Chinese politics, but Marxist
 ideology has given way to pragmatism in recent years. The party's authority rests
 primaly on the success of economic reform, its ability to maintain stability, appeals
 to patriotism, and control of the security apparatus.
 The security apparatus comprises the Ministries of State Security and Public Se-
 curity, the People's Armed Police, the People's Liberation Army, and the state judi-
 cial, procuratorial, and penal systems. The security forces were responsible for nu-
 merous human rights abuses.
 China has a mixed economy that is robust and expanding rapidly. Economic re-
 forms continue to raise living standards, encourage private entrepreneurial activity,
 diminish central control over the economy, and create new economic opportunities.
 Income disparities between coastal regions and the interior are siam.ficant and
 growing, but there has been a sharp drop in the number of Chinese living in abso-
 lute pover  in recent years.
 During the year the Government continued to commit widespread and well-docu-
 mented human rights abuses, in violation of internationally accepted norms, stem-
 ming both from the authorities' intolerance of dissent and the inadequacy of legal
 safeguards for basic freedoms. Abuses included arbitrary and lengthy incommuni-
 cado detention, forced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of prisoners. Prison
 conditions remained harsh. The Government continued severe restrictions on free-
 dom of speech, the press, assembly, association, religion, privacy, movement, and
 worker rights.
 Although the Government denies that it holds political prisoners, the number of
 persons detained or serving sentences for "counterrevolutionary crimes" or for crimi-
 nal convictions for peaceful political or religious activities are believed to number
 in the hundreds-perhaps thousands. The Government still has not provided a com-
 prehensive, credibl pubic accounting of all those missing or detained in connection
 with the suppression of the 1989 demonstrations. Persons detained during 1995 in-
 cluded activists arrested after the issuance of prodmocracy petitions in March and
 May. Throughout the year, Chinese leaders moved swiftly to cut off organized ex-
 pressions of protest or criticism and detained government critics, including those ad-
 vocating worker rights. Discrimination against women, minorities, and the disabled,
 and violence against women and the abuse of children remain problems.
 Although the Government permits local, competitive elections in villages inhab-
 ited by millions of rural Chinese, citizens have no ability peacefully to change either
 their leaders at higher levels of government or the form of government. The Con-
 stitution provides for fundamental human rights, but they are frequently ignored in
 practice, and challenges to the CCP's political authority are often dealt with harshly
 and arbitrarily. Legal safeguards for those detained or imprisoned are ignored or in-
 consistently implemented.he Government attaches higher priority to maintaining
 
 
 575
 public order and suppressing political opposition than to enforcing legal norms. For
 example, the judidial system denies criminal defendants basic legal safeguards such
 as due process or adequate defense, as demonstrated by the 20-month mcommuni-
 cado detention, abrupt formal arrest, and sentencing to 14 years' imprisonment of
 leading dissident Wei Jingsheng for the peaceful expression of his political beliefs.
 Overall in 1995 the authorities stepped up repression of dissent. By year's end,
 almost all public dissent against the central authorities was silenced by intimida-
 tion, exile, or imposition of prison terms or administrative detention. The Govern.
 ment's November decision to name a Panchen Lama without the Dalai Lama's con-
 currence was symptomatic of the politicization of this question and a broader tight-
 ening of strictures on some religious believers. Nonofficial Christian churches and
 some Muslim groups also experienced intensified repression in 1995. In similar fash-
 ion, the Government strengthened controls over disaffected ethnic groups in Tibet,
 Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang.
 During 1995 the Government also took some steps that raised the possibility of
 positive developments in the human rights situation in China over the long term.
 In August and September the Government hosted the U.N. Fourth World Con-
 ference on Women and an associated Nongovernmental Organizations Forum (NGO
 Forum) both of which discussed women's and universal human rights. Government
 restrictions on the free exercise of internationally recognized freedoms of speech and
 association hampered the discussion, however. The Government also moved forward
 with legislation designed to make political and judicial processes more transparent.
 In February the National Peoples' Congress (C) passed three new laws designed
 to hold judges, prosecutors, and policemen to higher standards; the new laws came
 into effectJuly 1. In October the Ministry of Justice promulgated implementing reg-
 ulations for 1994 legislation that allows citizens to sue government agencies for mal-
 feasance and to collect damages. The Government has also drafted a lawyer's law
 that would clarify the nature of the attorney-client relationship, improve profes-
 sional standards, separate most lawyers from state employment, and improve the
 ability of citizens to defend their legal interests; the legislature had not passed this
 law by year's end. In many respects, Chinese society continued to open up: greater
 disposable income, looser ideological controls, and freer access to outside sources of
 information have led to greater room for individual choice, more diversity in cultural
 life, and increased media reporting. Although the sale and use of satellite dishes are
 tightly regulated, satellite television broadcasts are widely available, particularly in
 coastal areas. Telephone and facsimile communication is also extensively used. In
 many cities, the introduction of commercial Internet service promoted access to
 international sources of information. At year's end, however, new government limits
 on Internet access threatened to halt the growth of Internet use. In addition, new
 controls on reporting economic information introduced doubts about the Govern-
 ment's commitment to freedom of information. Government control of news media
 generally continues to depend on self-censorship to regulate political and social con-
 tent, but the authorities also consistently penalize those who exceed the
 permissable. China continued a human rights dialog with some foreign interlocutors
 in the first half of 1995. Although no formal dialogs were held in the second half
 of the year, the Government agreed in late 1995 to schedule some bilateral dialogs
 in early 1996. The Government is increasingly willing to acknowledge openly certain
 human rights problems, especially official abuse of citizens' rights; some of these
 abuses are documented in the press.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The number of extrajudicial killings
 by government officials'fit 1995, or the adequacy of the government response, is im-
 possible to determine because the Government restricts access to such information.
 There were individual accounts of such killngs, including some carried in the Chi-
 nese press. In February the former director or a police station in Tangshan, Hebei,
 was sentenced to death for torturing a suspect to death; five other policeman were
 sentenced to 5 to 15 years' imprisonment for their involvement. A policeman in
 Hebei was sentenced to death in February for shooting a peasant to death during
 a dispute over a traffic accident. In March an authoritative article in the People's
 Daily described a case in which several village officials were sentenced to death or
 prison for murdering a peasant who had complained about arbitrary fees. In a re-
 port to the NPC in March, China's Chief Procurator described a case in Heilongliang
 where police had tried to frame a suspect for murder, but the Procuratorate discov-
 ered that the victim had actually been tortured to death. The true culprit was then
 arrested.
 
 
 576
 b. Disappearance.-Disappearances and long incommunicado detentions continued
 in 1995. There were no indications that security forces killed those who were taken
 into custody.
 c. Torture and Other Cruet, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Both official Chinese sources and international human rights groups continued to
 report many cases in which police and other elements of the security apparatus em-
 ployed torture and degrading treatment in dealing with detained and imprisoned
 persons in violation of legal prohibitions. Persons detained pending trial were par-
 ticularly at risk as a result of government failure to correct obvious systemic weak-
 nesses in the design and operation of the legal system. These weaknesses include
 a reliance on confessions as a basis for convictions and the lack of access to pris-
 oners by legal counsel and family members until after authorities file formal
 charges, a step which often takes months. Former detainees have credibly reported
 that officials used cattle prods, electrodes prolonged periods of solitary confinement
 and incommunicado detention, beating, shackles, and other forms of abuse against
 detained men and women.
 aAgainst the background of these reports, the Government claims to have under-
 tkena campaign to redue incidents of torture. Because prisoners remain inacces-
 sible to international humanitarian organizations, such as the International Com-
 mittee of the Red Cross (ICRC), these claims are impossible to verify. In March the
 Supreme People's Procuratorate reported it had investigated 409 cases in which tor-
 ture was used to extract confessions in 1994, but it provided no information on con-
 victions or punishments. The number of actual incidents of torture and ill-treatment
 by government officials is almost certainly far greater than this statistic indicates.
 The Chinese press reported in February that five public security officers from
 Shanxi were sentenced to death for extracting a confession through torture; another
 five were sentenced to 5 years to life imprisonment in the same case. Anhui Prov-
 ine "investigated 26 cases of torture in 1994 whle Shanghai's procuratorate re-
 ported 9 cases. Shenzhen authorities reportedly investigated 17 policemen for con-
 ducting "forced interrogations" in 1994. In April procuratorate officials emphasized
 the need to crack down on cases of favoritism, dereliction of duty, major accidents,
 extortion of confessions by torture, and illegal detention.
 Chinese officials reported in 1994 that the Procuratorate had assigned a total of
 748 officials to China's jails, "reform through labor," and "reeducation through
 labor" facilities. Their responsibility was to supervise prison management and en-
 force laws on treatment of prisoners. Procuratorial offices or officers were assigned
 in 1994 to approximately 94 percent of prisons and labor camps. In 1994 another
 7,000 officials were responsible for supervising China's detention centers.
 In December 1994, China enacted a new prison law designed, in part, to improve
 treatment of detainees and respect for their legal rights. Conditions in penal institu-
 tions are generally harsh and frequently degrading, and nutritional and health con-
 ditions are sometimes grim. Adequate medical care for prisoners continues to be a
 problem, despite officiar assurances that prisoners have the right to prompt medical
 treatment if they become ill. In 1995 political prisoners who reportedly had difficul-
 ties in obtaining timely and adequate medical treatment included Bao Tong, Ren
 Wanding, Gao Yu, Zhang Xianiang, and Fu Shenqi. In July authorities released
 Yang Zhou, who had developed a tumor in his throat, on medical parole; he received
 permission to go to the United States in September for medical treatment. Chen
 Ziming, who had been released on medical parole in 1994, had his medical parole
 abruptly revoked in June, and he was returned to prison despite having been diag-
 nosed as suffering from cancer. Gyaltsen Kelsang, a Tibetan nun, died in February
 after her release on medical parole in December 1994. According to international
 human rights groups, she had been mistreated in prison and had been diagnosed
 with severe kidney problems.
 The Chinese press reported in February that the Government has established 157
 psychological treatment centers and 54 consultation clinics in the nation's 685 pris-
 ons. The same report claimed that more than 17,000 prisoners were treated at those
 facilities over the past 10 years. There was no information in 1995 indicating wheth-
 er detained dissidents are incarcerated in psychiatric institutions and treated with
 drugs. Neither conditions at such institutions nor treatment of prisoners at these
 centers could be verified because of lack of access by independent observers.
 Conditions of imprisonment for political prisoners vary widely. Political prisoners
 are often incarcerated with common criminals. In January fellow inmates at a
 Wuhan prison beat Tong Yi, former secretary of Wei Jingsheng, on at least two oc-
 casions. Hen Wanding, Zhang Lin, and Qin Yongmin have reportedly also been se-
 verely beaten by other inmates.
 China does not permit independent monitoring of prisons. The Procuratorate,
 charged with law enforcement in the corrections system, in 1994 reported 39,342
 
 
 577
 violations of law in prisons, 17,823 of which were corrected. In March the Govern-
 ment indefinitely postponed negotiations with the ICRC regarding access to pris-
 oners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under the Criminal Procedure Law, offi-
 cials may hold detainees for up to 10 days before the Procuratorate must approve
 a formal arrest warrant. In theory the Admstrative Procedure Law permits a de-
 tainee to challenge the legality of his or her detention. In practice, however, lack
 of access to legal counsel inhibits the effective use of this law to obtain prompt judi-
 cial decisions on the issue. The State Compensation Law that came into force on
 January 1 provides a legal basis for citizens to recover damages for illegal deten-
 tions. There is no judicially supervised system of bail, but at the discretion of public
 security officials some detainees can be released pending further investigation. The
 authorities must notify the detainee's family or work unit of his detention within
 24 hours; in practice, however, authorities seldom give timely notification. Under a
 sweeping exception to the law, officials need not provide notification if it would
 "hinder the investigation" of a case.
 In 1994 the Government issued revised public order regulations setting out pen-
 alties for social groups that failed to register with the proper authorities or for per-
 sons on parole or deprived of political rights who "violate regulations," as well as
 for several other offenses. With some exceptions, violators can be detained for up
 to 15 days and fined about $23 (RMB200).
 Because the Government tightly controls information, it is impossible to estimate
 accurately the total number of people subjected to new or continued arbitrary arrest
 or detention. Nevertheless, Procurator General Zhang Siqing reported in March to
 the NPC that during 1994 the Supreme Procuratorate investigated 4,441 illegal de-
 tention cases involving 316 judicial officers. These figures likely include illegal de-
 tentions of those involved in commercial disputes as well as those detained for polit-
 ical reasons.
 In practice, authorities often disregarded or circumvented limits on detention by
 using regulations on "taking in for shelter and investigation," "supervised resi-
 dence," and other methods not requiring procuratorial approval. Dissident Wei
 Jinqsheng was held incommunicado, without charge in "supervised residence" from
 April 1994 until the Government filed formal subversion charges in November 1995.
 Wei was tried, convicted, and sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment in December.
 Several other political activists, including Wang Dan Liu Nianchun, Liu Xiaobo,
 Huan Xiang, Wang Donghai, and others were detained in May and continued to be
 held without charge at year's end.
 The authorities also used parole regulations to control activists' activities. In April
 Guangdong dissident Wang Xizhe's parole, scheduled to end on April 20 was ex-
 tended through 1999. Under the terms of his parole, Wang must report to the Public
 Security Bureau (PSB) monthly and request PSB permission before leaving
 Guangzhou. In order to air his grievances, Wang traveled in May to Beijing, where
 authorities arrested and beat him. In June he was transferred to Guangzhou and
 released. In September a Guangzhou court denied his appeal of the parole exten-
 sion.
 Local officials and business leaders frequently conspire to use detentions as a
 means of exerting pressure in commercial disputes. In September a Chinese US.
 legal permanent resident, Cui Peiyan, was abducted from his home in Fuzhou,
 Fujian province, by off-duty public security officers acting at the direction of the
 Hunan Provincial Animal Byproducts Corporation (HTSC), with which he had a
 commercial dispute. Until his escape 6 weeks later, he was held in a shed and beat-
 en regularly. His wife reported that she was repeatedly called by HTSC employees
 demanding money. In April the Chief Procurator of Zhejiang, a coastal province with
 significant foreign trade and investment, reported 146 cases in 1994 of illegal hos-
 tage-taking in trade disputes. In March Us. citizen Troy McBride and a partner
 were detained for several weeks at a hotel in Hefei, Anhui Province, in connection
 with a business dispute after a local court seized the American's passport. There
 were numerous similar cases involving detained foreign businessmen whose pass-
 ports were confiscated. Australian businessman James Peng, whom Chinese public
 security officials kidnaped in Macau in 1994 and brought to China for tria, was
 tried publicly in November 1994, but not sentenced until September. He received
 a lengthy prison sentence; his appeal was denied, and he remains detained in
 China.
 Security personnel sometimes "invited" activists to take vacations at government
 expense outside of Beijing and other cities at sensitive times. The alternative to ac-
 cepting such invitations was detention. A number of activists left Beijing on govern-
 ment-sponsored "vacations7 during the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women.
 Tong Zeng, who planned to lobby conference participants for Japanese compensation
 
 
 578
 for atrocities committed during World War H, was rportedly forced to leave Beijing
 for 21 days in the company of 20 public security officers. He spent the duration of
 the conference in Guangxi, a province in southern China. Liu  ianchun reportedly
 received an invitation to take a government-paid holiday with his family to Hainan
 Island during the period of the anniversarq of the 1989 Tiananmen demonstrations.
 It is possible that his refusal to leave BeiJng was related to his May 21 detention.
 Other activists who might otherwise have een in contact with foreigners during
 the conference were detained under questionable official charges. Ding Zilin and
 Jiang Peikun, whose son died during the 1989 Tiananmen demonstrations, were
 held in the eastern city of Wuxi in connection with an "economic" dispute. Authori-
 ties sentenced Liu Gang to 15 days confinement reportedly for breaching post-re-
 lease conditions. Wang Zhihong, wife of Chen Ziming, was summoned in August to
 move to the Beijing prison where her husband is held, and detained with him dur-
 ing the conference.
 Although there are no reports of the Government forcibly exiling citizens, authori-
 ties imposed restrictions on reentry into China by dissidents and activists (see Sec-
 tion 2.d.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-According to the Constitution, the court system
 is equal in authority to the State Council and the Central Military Commission, the
 two most important government institutions. All three organs are nominally under
 the supervision of the NPC. Officials insist that China's judiciary is independent but
 acknowledge that it is subject to the Communist Party's policy guidance. In practice,
 party and government leaders use a variety of means to pressure the courts on ver-
 dicta and sentences. Corruption and conflicts of interest also affect judicial decision-
 making. Supreme Court President Ren Jianxin reported in March to the NPC that
 in 1994 the judiciary disciplined some 1,094 court staff for illegal exercise of duty,
 and 34 judges received criminal penalties. The Supreme People's Court stands at
 the apex of the court system, followed in descending order by the hiher, intermedi-
 ate, and basic people's courts. Judges are appointed by the peoples congresses at
 the corresponding level. There are special courts for handling military, maritime,
 and railway transport cases.
 In February the NPC passed three new laws designed to professionalize judges,
 prosecutors, and policemen. Leading judicial officials exhorted the courts and law
 enforcement agencies to implement the new laws, which came into effect on July
 1.
 In practice, officials often ignore due process provisions of the Constitution. Both
 before -and after trial, prisoners are subjected to severe psychological pressure to
 confess. Defendants who fail to "show the right attitude" by confessing their crimes
 are typically sentenced more harshly. There is no presumption of innocence in the
 criminal justice system. Criminal trials remain essentially sentencing hearings, de-
 spite official denials. Confessions without corroborating evidence are insufficient for
 a conviction under law, but coerced confessions are frequently introduced into evi-
 dence.
 The case of US. citizen Harry Wu exemplified problems with the lack of proce-
 dural and substantive due process of law and also the problem of forced confessions.
 On June 19, Chinese authorities detained Wu when he applied for entry at a border
 post in Xinjiang Province on a US. passport with a valid Chinese visa. Official gov-
 ernment statements characterized Wu as a "criminal" weeks before his court trial.
 On July 27, the Government released a videotape which the official press character-
 ized as a "confession" of Wu's alleged crimes; Wu's interrogators filmed his state-
 ments without his knowledge. Chinese Ambassador Sha Zukang told the U.N.
 Human Rights Commission in Geneva on August 4 that Wu was a criminal who
 stole national secrets. On August 24, Wu was tried and convicted to 14 years in
 prison at a trial attended by a U.S. diplomat that otherwise was closed to the public.
 Wu was expelled from China the same day; he returned to the United States.
 The authorities give accused persons virtually no opportunity to prepare an ade-
 quate defense while their cases are being investi ated, the phase during which the
 question of guilt or innocence is essentially decided. The law provides that defense
 lawyers may be retained no earlier than 7 days before trial. However, in some cases
 even this brief period is shortened under regulations issued in 1983 to accelerate
 the adjudication of certain serious criminal cases. Under the law, there is no re-
 quirement that the court appoint a defense attorney for the defendant unless the
 defendant is hearing impaired or a minor, although the court may appoint defense
 counsel if it feels an attorney is necessary. When attorneys do appear, they have
 little time to prepare a defense and rarely contest guilt; their function is generalW_
 confined to requesting clemency. The conviction rate is over 90 percent. The courts
 permission iseur      before the accused or his representative can interrogate wit-
 nesses, produce new witnesses, or review evidence.
 
 
 579
 Political dissidents have not always been able to choose their own attorneys. In
 the case of Harry Wu, the authorities permitted Wu to choose only from a list of
 government-approved names. In the case of Shanghai dissident Yang Zhou, the au-
 thorities permitted Yang's wife to represent him in court, but later retaliated by re-
 voking her license to practice law.
 Chinese legal scholars and lawyers acknowledge that the legal system has some
 serious shortcomings and assert that reforms are under way. For example, an exper-
 inental trial system tested in 1994 has now been approved for use in Shanghai and
 other jurisdictions for most civil cases. The new system, which applies only to civil
 cases, introduces an adversarial element into trials by giving attorneys more respon-
 sibility for presenting evidence and arguing facts.
 Government officials state that China has an insufficient number of lawyers to
 meet the country's growing needs. A key element in Justice Ministry efforts to en-
 courage legal reform is a plan to have 150,000 lawyers, 30,000 notaries, and 200,000
 grassrootslegal service workers by the year 2000. Vice Minister of Justice Liu Yang
 stated in Way that China currently has 80,000 lawyers, 16,000 notaries, and
 100,000 grassroots legal service workers. According to the All China Lawyers Asso-
 ciation, China has 7,000 law firms. In many cities, lawyers are organizing private
 law firms outside the framework of established government legl offices. These
 firms are self-regulating and do not have their personnel or budgets determined di-
 rectly by the state. A foreign press report quoted Justice Ministry officials as stating
 that there were approximately 1,000 such firms in early 1995. Only a small percent-
 age of lawyers practice criminal law. Like other Chinese, many defense lawyers still
 depend on an official work unit for employment, housing, and other benefits. They
 are reportedly often reluctant to be viewed as overzealous in representing defen -
 ants in politically sensitive cases. In some such cases, relatives of defen ants re-
 ported finding it difficult to hire defense lawyer. _ . ..        .
 The Criminal Procedure Law requires that all trials be held in public, except
 those involving state secrets, juveniles, or "personal secrets." Details of cases involv-
 ing 'counterrevolutionary" charges, however, have frequently been kept secret, even
 from defendants' relatives, under this provision. The 1988 Law on State Secrets af-
 fords a ready basis for denying a public trial. There is an appeals process, but initial
 decisions are rarely overturned, and appeals generally do not provide meaningful
 protection against arbitrary or erroneous verdicts. Under the Criminal Procedure
 Law, persons 'exempted from prosecution" by procurators may still be deemed to
 have a criminal record, despite the lack of a judicial determination of guilt. Such
 provisions can be applied in counterrevolutionary crimes as well as for ordinary
 criminal offenses.
 Lack of due process has egregious consequences when defendants receive the
 death sentence. China's 1979 Criminal Code contained 26 crimes punishable by
 death; 1995 legislation raised this number to 65. In June the NPC approved legisla-
 tion permitting the death penalty for such financial crimes as counterfeiting cur-
 renc,     ing fake negotiable notes and letters of credit, and illegal "pelig of
 funds. In the late 1980's, research of the Chinese press put the total number of exe-
 cutions between 125 and 150 persons. In 1995 approximately 1,100 death sentences
 were reported in the Chinese media. The actual number of executions was probably
 significantly higher. A high court nominally reviews all death sentences, but the
 time between arrest and execution is often a matter of days, and reviews have con-
 sistently resulted in a confirmation of sentence. In October a bank robber in
 Shenyang was put to death 5 days after being captured; three peasants who com-
 mitted armed robbery on September 27 were put to death in "late September," and
 a failed stock market investor who went on a shooting spree in Shenyang on Octo-
 ber 24 was executed on October 29. In a rare public admission of error, a Liaoning
 court in August exonerated Li Xiuwu of stealing and murder and executed the "real
 killer. Li had been put to death in August 1988. No executions for political offenses
 are known to have occurred in 1995.
 n recent years, credible reports have alleged that organs from some executed
 prisoners are removed and transplanted. During 1995 officials confirmed that exe-
 cuted prisoners are among the primary sources of organs for transplant in China.
 Officials assert consent is required from prisoners or their relatives before organs
 are removed, but this assertion could not be verified. Officials acknowledge that
 China lacks national legislation governing organ donations.
 Justice Ministry statistics issued in January showed that China has imprisoned
 and released approximately 10 million prisoners since 1949; there were 1,285,000
 prisoners in prisons or reform through labor camps at the end of 1994. Only courts
 can sentence prisoners to these facilities. However, government authorities can as-
 sign persons accused of "minor" public order offenses to reeducation through labor
 camps in an extrajudicial process. Terms of detention run from a normal minimum
 
 
 of 1 year to a maximum of 3 years. The Labor Reeducation Committee, which deter-
 mines the term of detention, may extend an inmate's sentence for an additional
 year. According to prison officials, 200 000 detainees were in reeducation through
 labor facilities at the end of 1995, up from 153 000 at the end of 1993. Other esti-
 mates of the number of such inmates are considerably higher. Officials said that in
 1993 the Government released 75,900 persons from reeducation through labor facili-
 ties. Under a State Council Reglation issued in early 1991, those sentenced to re-
 education through labor may a  the committee to reconsider its decision.
 Since 1990 defendants have been able to challenge reeducation through labor sen-
 tences under the Administrative Procedure Law. While some persons have gained
 a reduction in or withdrawal of their sentences after reconsideration or appeal, in
 practice these procedures are not widely used, and short appeal times, lack of access
 to lawyers, andother problems weaken their effectiveness in preventing or reversing
 arbitrary decisions. Before departing the country in September, Yang Zhou unsuc-
 cessfully appealed the reeducation through labor sentence that he received in Sep-
 tember 1994. Irregular appellate procedures in his case included inadequate notice
 of the hearing, and a shift of venue from Shanghai to a labor camp hundreds of
 miles away.
 The number of political prisoners has declined in recent years, but hundreds-per-
 haps thousands--of such people remain imprisoned or detained. Government offi-
 cials deny that China holds any political prisoners asserting that authorities detain
 persons not for the political or religious views ley hold, but because they have
 taken some action which violates the Criminal Law.
 Political dissidents, however, are often detained or charged with having commit-
 ted counterrevolutionary crimes under Articles 90 through 104 of the Criminal Law.
 Counterrevolutionary offenses range from treason and espionage to spreading
 counterrevolutionary propaganda. The authorities have also used these articles to
 punish persons who organized demonstrations, disrupted traffic, disclosed official in-
 formation to foreigners, or formed associations outside of state control. In other
 cases, the system of reeducation through labor is used to punish political offenders
 without taking their cases to the courts.
 In January 1995, a Justice Ministry official said that there were 2,678 people
 serving sentences for counterrevolutionary crimes at the end of 1994. These figures
 include people convicted of espionage or other internationally recognized criminal of-
 fenses, but do not include political prisoners detained but not charged; political or
 religious activists held in reeducation through labor camps; and persons detained
 or convicted for criminal offenses solely involving nonviolent political or religious ac-
 tivities.
 The 1988 Law on State Secrets affords a ready basis for denying a public trial.
 Details regarding such cases under this provision are frequently kept secret, even
 from defendants relatives. In January the authorities acknowledged for the first
 time that Democracy Wall activist Zhao Fengping has remained in prison since
 1980, despite previous claims that all activists from that era had been released.
 Human rights monitors expressed concern that other less well-known activists from
 this period may also be serving prison sentences.
 The Government released during 1995 certain prisoners detained for political or
 religious reasons, including Yang Zhou. Nevertheless, many others, including Wei
 Jingsheng, Ren Wanding, Bao Tong, Zhang Lin, Bao Ge, Li Guotao, Yang Qingheng,
 and Dai Xuezhong, remained imprisoned or under other forms of detention. Some
 of those released in 1995 or earlier, such as Chen Ziming and Wang Dan, were har-
 assed by authorities after their release and then rearrested in connection with
 prodemocracy petitions submitted in March and May (see Section 1.d.).
 The Government subjects many prisoners-including political prisoners-to "dep-
 rivation of political rights" even after they have served their sentences. This status
 further limits rights of free speech and association. Former prisoners often find their
 status in society, ability to find employment, freedom to travel, and access to social
 services severely restricted. Economic reform and social change have ameliorated
 these problems to some extent in recent years. The families of political prisoners are
 sometimes subjected to police surveillance and harassment and also may encounter
 difficulty in obtaining or keeping employment and housing. For example, govern-
 ment harassment has prevented relatives of Chen Ziming from obtaining and keep-
 ing stead  employment. In September the authorities froze the joint bank account
 of Chen Ziming and his wife, ang Zhihong.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Eco-
 nomic liberalization is creating diverse employment opportunities and introducing
 market forces into the economy, thus loosening governmental monitoring and regu-
 lation of personal and family life, particularly in rural areas. In urban areas, how-
 ever, most people still depend on their government-linked work unit for housing,
 
 
 permission to have a child, approval to apply for a passport, and other aspects of
 ordinary life. The work unit, dong with the neighborhood committee, is charged
 with monitoring activities and attitudes.
 Although the law requires search warrants before security forces can search prem-
 ises, this provision is often ignored in practice. In addition, both the Public Security
 Bureau and Procuratorate apparently can issue search warrants on their own au-
 thority. The 1982 Constitution states that 'freedom and privacy of correspondence
 of citizens are protected by law." In practice, however, authorities frequently record
 telephone conversations of foreign visitors, businessmen, diplomats, residents, and
 journalists as well as Chinese dissidents and activists and others. Authorities also
 opn and censor domestic and international maiL In March Procurator General
 Zhang Siqing reported to the National People's Congress that in 1994 the Supreme
 People's Procuratorate investigated 1772 cases of illegal search or intrusion, and
 104 cases of violations of the right of correspondence. Government security organs
 monitor and sometimes restrict contact between foreigners and citizens, particularly
 dissidents. Rules implementing the State Security Law define as a violation of the
 law "activities of individuals outside the country (including non-Chinese citizens
 resident in China) who disregard dissuasion and meet with personnel in the country
 who have endangered state security or who are seriously suspected of endangering
 state security."
 The Government permitted increased international correspondence and informa-
 tion access when commercial Internet accounts became available in May. According
 to press reports, between March and July alone the number of computers associated
 with the Internet increased from 400 to 6,000, and the number of users rose from
 3,000 to 40,000. However, in the beginning of 1996 a moratorium on new Internet
 accounts and new regulations governing the content of Internet information threat-
 ened this rapid growth. Generally, the regulations appear to be designed to impose
 the same restrictions on the Internet as now limit public discourse in China: com-
 puter experts have reported that the authorities appear to be primarily seeking
 ways to limit explicit antigovernment political activity on the Internet. Chinese
 Internet technicians have prevented access to information from dissident groups
 abroad. At present, however, authorities appear to lack the technical expertise and
 resources to censor effectively information on the Internet. For example, politically
 controversial homepages remain accessible. New controls on dissemination of eco-
 nomic information also introduced doubts about the Government's commitment to
 expanding public access to information. The authorities continued to jam selectively
 Chinese language broadcasts of the Voice of America (VOA). The effectiveness of the
 jamming varies considerably by region, with audible signals of VOA and other
 broadcters reaching most parts of China, including the capital.
 The Government continued to implement comprehensive and highly intrusive one-
 child family planning poliies first adopted in the late 1970's. An official announce-
 ment in February that the population had reached 1.2 billion, roughly double the
 population of 40 years ago, suggested that Chinese efforts to control population
 growth have had mixed results. China's population policy most heavily affects ethnic
 HanChinese in urban areas. Urban couples seldom obtain permission to have a sec-
 ond child. Exceptions are allowed for the 70 percent of Han who live in rural areas,
 and ethnic minorities are subject to less stringent population controls.
 Population control policy relies on education, propaganda, and economic incen-
 tives, as well as on more coercive measures including psychologcal prssure and
 economic penalties. Rewards for couples that adhere to the policy include monthly
 stipends and preferential medical and educational benefits. )isciplinary measures
 against those who violate the policy include fines, withholding of social services, d-
 motion, and other administrative punishments, including, in some instances, loss of
 emploent. Fines for giving birth without authorization vary but they can be a for-
 midable disincentive. In Guangzhou, for example, the standard fine is calculated to
 be 30 to 50 percent of 7 years income for the average resident. Unpaid fines have
 sometim   eseulted in confiscation or destruction of personal property. Because pen-
 alties for excesptis rcan be levied against local officials and the mothers' work
 units, many individuals are affected, providing multiple sources of pressure.
 According to a government white paper released in Augnt, more than 200 million
 married couples of childbearing age, or about 80 per cent of all couples in that age
 group, use ontraception. The Government does not authorize physical compulsion
 to submit to abortion.oresterilization, but Chinese officials acknowledge thtthere
 are instances of forced abortions and sterilizations. Officials main  that, when
 discovered, the responsible officials are disciplined and undergo retraining, but they
 provided no data or examples to verify this assertion. Officials admit, however, at
 more severe punishment is rare. Individuals can sue officials who have exceeded
 
 
 582
 their authority in implementing family planning policy, but government officials
 have not provided statistics on or examples of successful suits on these grounds.
 Regulations forbid sex-selective abortion, but because of the traditional preference
 for male children, particularly in rural areas, some families have used ultrasound
 to identify female fetuses. Use of ultrasound for this purpose is specifically prohib-
 ited by the new Maternal and Child Health Care Law, which cals for punishment
 of medical practitioners violating this provision. In September a court reportedly
 sentenced a retired Shanghai doctor to 4 years in prison for identifying the sex of
 fetuses. The press has reported that the national ratio of male to female births is
 114 to 100 while the statistical norm is 106 male births to 100 female. This ratio
 may exclude many female births, especially the second or third in a family, which
 are unreported so that the parents can keep trying to conceive a boy, but also prob-
 ably reflects the abuse of sonography and sex-selective abortion. Female infanticide
 or neflect of baby girls may also be a factor in some areas.
 At east five provincial governments have implemented regulations seeking to pre-
 vent people with severe mental handicaps from having children. In June the Na-
 tional Maternal and Child Care Law came into effect. This law calls for premarital
 and prenatal examinations to determine whether couples have acute infectious dis-
 eases, certain mental illnesses (not including mental retardation), or are at risk for
 passing on debilitating genetic diseases. The Ministry of Health, not the State Fam-
 ily Planning Commission, is charged with implementing the new law, which man-
 dates abortion or sterilization in some cases, based on medical advice. The new
 measure also provides for obtaining a second opinion and states that patients or
 their guardians must give written consent to procedures (see also Section 5).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution states that freedom
 of speech and freedom of the press are fundamental rights enjoyed by all citizens,
 the Government interprets the Communist Party's "leading role as circumscribing
 these rights. It does not permit citizens to publish or broadcast criticism of senior
 leaders or opinions that contradict basic Communist Party doctrine, which provides
 for a Socialist state under the party's leadership. For example, the formal charges
 brought in 1995 against dissident and prodemocracy activist Wei Jingsheng were
 based on Wei's pub c criticism of the Government after his September 1993 release
 from prison. These criticisms, together with critical articles published outside of
 China, led to Wei's conviction in December for "subverting the Government" (see
 Section 1.d.).
 The Government and the party intensified control over the expression of unau-
 thorized political views in 1995. In August police broke up a press conference held
 in a private hotel by former Chinese comfort women" seeking compensation from
 the Japanese Government for World War II atrocities. Also in August public secu-
 rity personnel arrested 6 foreign Greenpeace demonstrators, detained them for 1
 day, and expelled them from China for unfurling an antinuclear banner in
 Tiananmen Square; 10 foreign journalists present were also detained. Authorities
 also limited the amount and type of written information brought into China by par-
 ticipants in the NGO Forum associated with the U.N. Fourth World Conference on
 Women that was held in Beijing September 5-15. In addition, Government intimida-
 tion and harassment of Conference and NGO Forum participants effectively limited
 the exercise of free expression during official proceedings (see Section 5). In Septem-
 ber security personnel detained and questioned a U.S. citizen for 2 hours after she
 protested in Tiananmen Square against government abortion policies.
 The party and the Government continue to control print and broadcast media and
 compel them to propagate the current ideological line. Both formal and informal
 press guidelines continued to require reprters to avoid coverage of sensitive sub-
 jects and to protect state secrets." Unde the State Security Law, "state secrets"
 are broadly defined, and interpretation is left to the Ministries of State Security and
 Public Security. In December the authorities refused to renew the visa of Beijing-
 based German journalist Henrik Bork, forcing him to leave China involuntarily.
 Chinese officials accused Bork of "negatively influencing German public opinion
 about China" in an article about Li Peng shortly before the Premier's 1994 visit to
 Gormany.
 Despite official admonitions, China's lively tabloid sector continued to expand in
 1995. Radio talk shows remained popular, and, while generally avoiding politically
 sensitive subjects, they provided opportunities for citizens to air grievances about
 public issues. Despite licensing requirements, a small but rapidly growing segment
 of the population has access to satellite television broadcasts. The Government in-
 troduced commercial Internet service in many cities during the year but imposed
 restrictions on Internet access at year's end (see Section 1.f.).
 
 
 Fierce competition and dwindling government subsidies have increased opportuni-
 ties for private publishers and booksellers, but the Government tried in 1995 to
 tighten its control over the production and dissemination of publications. In June
 the China Press and Publications Administration announced it would limit the num-
 ber of books published by controlling book registration numbers issued to officially
 approved publishing houses. Despite this effort, books continued to be published
 through unsanctioned channels.
 Fear of government retaliation limited artistic freedom of expression. In January
 a Being publisher reportedly backed out of a contract to print a collection of poems
 by former political prisoner Huang Xiang after learning about the poet's back-
 ground. In September a government "request" prompted director Zhang Yimou to
 cancel plans to attend the New York Film Festival showing of his fim "Shanghai
 Triad." In a series of incidents between June and October, security personnel har-
 assed  and   sometimes   arrested  artists  living  near  Beijing  University  at
 Yuanmingyuan. The crackdown appeared to be the result of official irritation over
 the artists' antigovernment political views.
 The Government has continued to impose heavy ideological controls on political
 discourse at colleges, universities, and research institutes. As a result, many intel-
 lectuals and scholars, fearing that books or papers on political topics would be
 deemed too sensitive to be published, feel compelled to exercise self-censorship. In
 areas such as economic policy or legal reform, there was far greater official tolerance
 for comment and debate.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-While the Constitution has
 provisions for freedom of peaceful assembly and association, the Government se-
 verely restricts these rights in practice. The Constitution provides, for example, that
 such activities may not infringe upon the "interests of the State." Protests against
 the political system or its leaders are prohibited.
 The Government tolerates some small-scale demonstrations about nonpolitical
 grievances, but authorities deny permits and quickly move to suppress demonstra-
 tions involving expression of dissident political views. In May the authorities de-
 tained or imprisoned dozens of activists, including Chen Zi*g, Wang Dan, and Liu
 Xiaobo, after they issued prodemocracy petitions.By the end of the month, 24 people
 were in detention, and another 20 had been questioned and released. However, un-
 authorized protests on nonpolitical subjects are not automatically disrupted. In
 March police allowed people protesting evictions from their homes to hold dem-
 onstrations for several days on a major Shanghai road. Local officials reportedly
 later met with protesters and acted on some of their grievances.
 The Communist Party organizes and controls most professional and other mass
 associations. Regulations promulgated in 1990 require all organizations to be offi-
 cially registered and approved. Ostensibly aimed at secret societies and criminal
 gangs, the regulations also deter the formation of unauthorized political or labor or-
 ganizations. Not only have Shanghai authorities refused to allow several persons to
 register a proposed "Human Rights Association," but they have detained members
 of the group. an   Zhou, a leader of the group, departed China in September (see
 Section 1.c.). Liu Nianchun, who was denied permission in 1994 to register the Asso-
 ciation for Protection of Labor Rights was among those arrested after issuance of
 prodemocracy petitions (see Section 1.d.).
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government subjects religious freedom to restric-
 reglations vai  severitynonetheless, the number of relious adherents continues
 to  row Whle he  onsituionaffrmstolraton  f rhgius eliefs, government
 restrict reigious practice to government-controlled religious organiza-
 tions and registered places of worship. The Government supervised the publication
 of about 1 million Bibles for distribution in 1994, but complaints that the amount
 of Christian religious materials fell far short of demand increased pressure on the
 Government to raise the number to 1.5 million in 1995. The State Council's Reli-
 gious Affairs Bureau and the United Front Work Department, which are staffed by
 officials who rarely are religious adherents, provide "guidance and supervision" over
 implementation of government regulations on religion and the role of foreigners in
 religious activity. The Catholic seminary in Chengdu, closed since an April 1994
 protest against party interference in school operations, has yet to reopen due to lack
 of funding and government support for efforts to relocate it to the outskirts of the
 city. Communist Party officials state that party membership and religious belief are
 incompatible. This places a serious limitation on religious believers, since party
 membership is required for almost all high positions in government and state-owned
 businesses. According to a 1995 government survey, 20 percent of Communist Party
 members engage in religious activities. In January the CCP circulated a document
 to party organizations at the provincial level ordering expulsion of party members
 belonging to open or clandestine religious organizations.
 
 
 584
 The Government's treatment of religious believers and organizations often varies
 widely depending on the locality. Unregistered or "house" church leaders and mem-
 bers are harassed in some regions but tolerated in others. Nonmainstream sects are
 often singled out. In February a Shanghai splinter group of the Henan-based Chris-
 tian evangelical sect known as the "Shouters" was broken up and its members har-
 assed. Twenty leaders of the "Anointed One" sect reportedly were detained. The
 Shouters sect has been deemed counterrevolutionary by the Government and its
 members detained, fined, and imprisoned since its establishment more than 15
 years ago. In February and March, police raided and broke up a house church meet-
 ing in Huadu City in Guangzhou municipality. In the March raid, Huadu police re-
 portedly beat worshipers. In March Henan police harassed and detained Protestant
 house church worshipers in Zhoukou City. In April and May, police arrested some
 140 Christian evangelists based in Fangcheng County, Henan, who had been sent
 by their unofficial churches to various parts of the country to proselytize. According
 to reports, in mid-June Public Security Bureau officials in Yingshang county, Anhui,
 raided numerous Protestant house churches and arrested approximately 300 Chris-
 tians for "illegal religious activities." Reportedly, electric batons were used during
 the raids.
 After forcefully suppressing all religious observances and closing all seminaries
 during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolutiofi, the Government began in the late 1970's
 to restore or replace damaged or confiscated churches, temples, mosques, and mon-
 asteries and allowed seminaries to reopen. According to the Government, there are
 now 68,000 religious sites in China and 48 religious colleges. The Government also
 adopted a policy of returning confiscated church property. Implementation of this
 policy has varied from locality to locality. The official religious organizations admin-
 ister more than a dozen Catholic and Protestant seminaries, nine institutes to train
 imams and Islamic scholars, and institutes to train Buddhist monks. Students who
 attend these institutes must demonstrate "political reliability," and all graduates
 must pass an examination on their theological and political knowledge to qualify for
 the clergy. The Government permitted some Catholic seminarians, Muslim clerics,
 and Buddhist clergy to go abroad for additional religious studies in 1995.
 The authorities permit officially sanctioned religious organizations to maintain
 international contacts as long as these do not entail foreign control. In January
 1994, China promulgated regulations on religious practices by foreigners and on
 places of religious activities. The regulations codified many existing rules, including
 a ban on proselytizing by foreigners, but allow foreign nationals to preach to foreign-
 ers, bring in religious materials for their own use, and preach to Chinese at church-
 es, mosques, and temples at the invitation of registered religious organizations. In
 practice, authorities tolerate some discreet proselytizing and distribution of religious
 texts by foreigners outside official channels.
 Before the Fourth World Conference on Women, government organizers instructed
 foreign participants not to bring in religious materials other than those for personal
 use. Leaders of Protestant house churches were warned to avoid contact with con-
 ference delegates arriving from foreign countries. One Catholic leader, Bishop Jia
 Zhiguo, was detained until the day after the conference.
 Buddhists are the largest body of religious believers in China. The Government
 estimates that there are 100 million Chinese Buddhists, most of whom are from the
 dominant Han ethnic group. The Government says that there are 9,500 Buddhist
 temples and monasteries in China and 170,000 nuns and monks. In May Beijing
 hosted a three-nation conference which addressed cooperation between Chinese gov-
 ernment-sanctioned Buddhist leaders and South Korean and Japanese Buddhist
 representatives. (A discussion of government restrictions on Tibetan Buddhism can
 be found in the addendum to this report.)
 According to government figures, there are 17 million Muslims in China. In some
 areas with large Muslim populations, officials continue to restrict the building of
 mosques and the religious education of youths under the age of 18. Following unrest
 in 1990 in Xinjiang, which has a large Muslim population, the authorities issued
 regulations further restricting religious activities and teaching. Authorities in
 Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, another province with a large Muslim population,
 issued regulations in July 1994 forbidding religious bodies from interfering in ad-
 ministrative affairs, including education, marriage, and family planning. China per-
 mits Muslim citizens to make the haji to Mecca, and the number of those making
 the pilgrimage has significantly increased in recent years. About 6,000 Chinese
 made the haj in 1994 at their own expense.
 The number of Christians continues to grow rapidly. However, only those Chris-
 tian churches affiliated with either the Catholic Patriotic Association or the (Protes-
 tant) Three Self Patriotic Movement may operate openly. The Government estab-
 
 
 585
 lished both organizations in the 1950's to eliminate perceived foreign domination of
 local Christian groups.
 Active unofficial religious movements pose an alternative to the state-regulated
 churches, although in some areas there is tacit cooperation between official and un-
 official churches. The unofficial, Vatican-affiliated, Catholic Church claims a mem-
 bership far larger than the 4 million registered with the official Catholic Church,
 although actual figures are unknown. Reliable estimates indicate that there are
 about 10 million people who belong to the official Protestant church, while perhaps
 twice that many worship privately in house churches that are independent of gov-
 ernment control.
 There continued to be credible reports in 1995 of efforts by authorities in some
 areas to rein in activities of the unapproved Catholic and Protestant movements, in-
 cluding raiding and closing a number of unregistered churches. In January 1994,
 new regulations tightening an existing requirement that all church groups register
 with the state-controlled Religious Affairs Bureau went into effect. These regula-
 tions have presented religious believers with the choice of registering and bringing
 their congregations under official control or continuing to operate underground and
 risking fines, arrests, and prison sentences. It was reported in 1995 that Vincent
 Qin Guoliang and Li Zbdxin, two priests affiliated with the unofficial Catholic
 Church in Qinghai Province, were sentenced to 2 years in a labor camp in November
 1994. In February police reportedly detained nine church workers after raiding one
 unofficial church in Huai'an, Jiangsu Province. According to press reports, a Jiangsu
 official warned in a church publication that Christian meeting places deemed con-
 trolled by hostile forces would be banned. Guangzhou preacher Li Dexian was de-
 tained four separate times and allegedly beaten by police after attempts to give his
 monthly sermons at a house church outside of Guangzhou. According to press re-
 ports in December, Beijing authorities sentenced underground Christian activists
 XI Yonghai, Cao Feng, and Liu Fenggang to up to 22/2 years reeducation through
 labor. Elsewhere, authorities tolerate the existence of unofficial Catholic and Protes-
 tant churches as long as they remain small and discreet.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The effectiveness of the Government's identification card system used
 to control and restrict the location of individual residences within the country con-
 tinued to erode in 1995. The 'floating population" of economic migrants leaving their
 home areas to seek work elsewhere in China is estimated to be over 100 million.
 Because this itinerant population lacks official status, its access to housing, school-
 ing, and the full range of employment opportunities is limited.
 Authorities have denied some former inmates permission, under the "staying at
 prison employment" system, to return to their homes, a provision applicable to re-
 cidivists incarcerated in "reform through labor, camps. Those inmates sentenced to
 more than 5 years in reeducation through labor camps also may lose their legal
 right to return home. For those assigned to camps far from their residences, this
 constitutes a form of internal exile. The number of prisoners subject to this restric-
 tion is unknown. Authorities have reportedly forced others to accept jobs in state
 enterprises where they can be more closely supervised after their release -from pris-
 on or detention.
 Other released detainees returned home but were not permitted freedom of move-
 ment. The Government prevented ITu Gang from traveling within China and abroad
 after his release from prison in June when Jilin provincial authorities refused to ac-
 cept his written travel application. Chen Ziming's movements were also restricted
 during the time he was released from prison on medical parole. Official concern
 about the June anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident prompted pub-
 lic security personnel to force Chen, his wife, and their nephew to remain at home
 on May 31 rather than participate in a family outing at a local park. Chen's medical
 parole was abruptly revoked in June.
 The Government routinely permits legal emigration and most foreign travel. Al-
 though regulations promulgated in 1990 required college graduates to repay the cost
 of their free postsecondary education by working for 5 years before going abroad,
 students wishing to go abroad still routinely were able to obtain passports. Permis-
 sion for couples to travel abroad was sometimes conditioned on agreement to delay
 childbirth; noncompliance triggered fines for the couple or their work unit. The Gov-
 ernment continued to use political attitudes as a major criterion in selecting people
 for government-sponsored study abroad, but it did not similarly control privately
 sponsored students, who currently constitute the majority of students studying
 abroad The Government continued efforts to attract persons who have studied over-
 seas back to China. Official media have said that before returning home, people who
 have joined foreign organizations hostile to China should quit them and refrain from
 activities that violate Chinese law.
 
 
 586
 In January Human Rights Watch/Asia and Human Rights in China announced
 the existence of two blacklists of Chinese dissidents banned from returning to China
 because of their political beliefs. Persons reportedly on the list, over 80 percent of
 whom lived in the United States, included Yan Jiaqi, Su Xiaokang, Harry Wu, and
 many persons active in the 1989 Tiananmen demonstrations. Authorities continued
 to refuse to allow labor activist Han Dongfang to return to China, after revoking
 his passport in 1993, on the grounds that he had engaged in activities hostile to
 China while overseas.
 The Government continued to accept the repatriation of citizens who had entered
 other countries or territories illegally. In 1995 in addition to the routine return of
 Chinese illegal immigrants found in Hong Kong, the Government continued accept-
 the return of several groups of illegal immigrants from other countries. Citizens
 illegally smuggled to other countries were ofIr return for a
 short time to determine identity and any past criminal record or involvement in
 smugging activities. As a deterrent and to recover local costs incurred during the
 repaiation, the authorities in some areas levied a fine of $1,000 or more on reurn-
 ees.
 Since the late 1980'S, China has adopted a de factoaplicy of tolerance toward the
 small number of persons-less than 100 annually-frm other nations who have
 registered with ",he Beijing offie of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) as asylum seekers. China has permitted these persons to stay in China
 while the UNHCR makes determinations as to their status and-if the UJNHCR de-
 termines that they are bona fide refugees-while they await resettlement in third
 countries. Treatment of asylum seekers who present themselves initially to Chinese
 authorities is unknown. China has no law or regulations that authorize the authori-
 ties to grant refugee status, but the authorities continue to work with the UNHCR
 on such measures.
 The Government provided local resettlement to almost 300,000 refugees, over-
 whelminly ethnic Chinese, who left Indochina for China during the late 1970's and
 the 1980 s. The authorities have accepted the return to China of would-be illegal
 emigrants to Hong Kong and Australia from among these refugees, provided China
 can verify their identity and willingness to return voluntarily. China has success-
 fully worked with Las and Camboia to facilitate the return of resettled refugees
 who have decided to go back to their home countries, but it has been unable to ob-
 tain Vietnamese agreement to accept 6,000 persons who have sought to return to
 their homes in that country. Although the Government denies having tightened its
 policy on accepting Vietnamese refugees, in recent years very few suc refugees
 have been resettled in China. China has not signed the Comprehensive Plan of Ac-
 tion negotiated at the Geneva International Conference on Indochinese Refugees in
 1989.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens lack the means to change their government legally and cannot freely
 choose or change the laws and officials that govern them. Citizens vote directly only
 for party-reviewed candidates for delegate positions in county-level people's con-
 gresses. People's congress delegates at the provincial level, however, are selected by
 county-level people's congresses, and in turn provincial-level people's con rsses se-
 lect delegates to the National People's Congress (NPC). Although the CCP a proves
 the candi tes, many county and previncal elections are competitive, with more
 candidates running than there are seats avaiable. According to the 1982 Constitu-
 tion, the NPC is the highest organ of state power. It elects the President and Vice
 President, selects the Premier, and elects the Chairman of the Government's
 Central Military Commission. Delegates attending the 1995 session of the NPC dis-
 played an unusual degree of assertiveness when one-third voted against a candidate
 for Vice Premier, and slightly more voted against important government-proposed
 legislation. The NPC does not in practice, however, have the power to determine pol-
 icy or remove government or party leaders.
 The election and agenda of people's congresses at all levels remain under firm
 control by the Communist Party, the paramount source of political authority in
 China. The Constitution was amendoed in 1993 to ratify the existence of small
 "democratic  parties, but these play only a minor consultative role, and all pledge
 allegiance to the Communist Party. The Party retains a tight rein on political dei-
 sionmaking.
 Direct electtion for basic level or village government is legally sanctioned for all
 of China's 1 million villages. Foreign observers estimate that more than one-third
 of China's 900 million rural residents have already participated in elections for local
 leaders. Although many villages have yet to hold truly competitive elections, central
 
 
 587
 government officials appeared intent on further popularizing the competitive elec-
 tion process. Successful village elections have included campaignig, platforms, and
 the use of secret ballots. TheMinistry of Civil Affairs, which administers the village
 election program, plans to set up an election training center in Beijing that wl
 train local and provincial officials how to teach others the basic techniques of run-
 ning democratic elections. There were credible reports that candidates most favored
 by the authorities were defeated in some local, village elections. In early 1995, a
 local Communist Party secretary in eastern China reportedly attempted to fire an
 elected Village Chief, but the Chief retained his position after suing and winning
 a judgment in local court. Elections have reportedly reduced corruption and brought
 better management to some villages. Political controls, however, remain tight, and
 village elections do not threaten implemention of unpopular central policies or en-
 danger the "leading role" of the Communist Party.
 The official requirement that associations register and be approved discourages
 independent interest groups from forming and affecting the system. Social organiza-
 tions registered in recent years include gups promoting environmental protection,
 consumer rights, charitable work, and the rights of the disabled, but the Govern-
 ment monitors their activities to ensure that they remain apolitical. Dozens of activ-
 ists who submitted prodemocracy petitions to government authorities in March and
 May were subsequently detained or arrested (see Section 1.d.).
 The Government places no restrictions on the participation of women or minority
 groups in the political process. The Government and party organizations include
 some 12.4 million women officials. In August the press reported that women con-
 stituted 21 percent of National People's Congress delegates and 12.3 percent of NPC
 standing committee members. Approximately 13.5 percent of members of the Chi-
 nese People's Political Consultative Conference were women. Women, however, hold
 relatively few positions of significant influence within the arty or government
 structure. There are no women, for example, in the 21-member olitburo.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no independent Chinese organizations that publicly monitor or com-
 ment on human rights conditions in China. The Government has made it clear that
 it will not tolerate the existence of such groups. Shanghai officials have refused to
 register the Chinese Human Rights Association founded by Yang Zhou and other
 dissidents. Yang left China in September (see Section 1.c.). Other cofounders were
 detained, but it is not clear whether their detentions resulted solely from their in-
 volvement in the group. Wang Dan, a Tiananmen-era activist, announced in 1994
 his intention to investigate China's human rights situation and subsequently was
 detained repeatedly for brief periods. In 1995 the authorities detained him in con-
 nection with prodemocracy petitions issued in May (see Section 1.d.). He remained
 in detention at year's end.
 Since 1991 the Government has promoted limited academic study and discussion
 of concepts of human rights. Research institutes in Shanghai and Beijing, including
 the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, have organized symposia on human rights,
 established human rights research centers, and visited other countries to study
 human rights practices in those nations. In 1993 the Government formed the China
 Society for Human Rights Studies as a "nongovernmental organization"; its efforts
 have focused largely on improving China's image abroad and responding to criticism
 of China's human rights record. In March the Society's director publicly criticized
 the 1994 US. State Department report on human rights practices in China and de-
 fended Chinese practices, glossing over fundamental human rights abuses that the
 Government continues to perpetrate. In December the State Council's Information
 Office issued a white paper entitled 'The Progress of Human Rights in China" that
 restated Chinese views on human rights issues and defended China's human rights
 record in similiar terms.
 The Government agreed in September to the platform for action adopted at the
 U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women but called into question its commitment
 to the platform and international human rights standards by its treatment of Con-
 ference and NGO Forum participants (see Section 5). The platform recognized the
 universality of human rights. Despite this public acknowledgment of universal
 human rights principles, Chinese officials accept only in theory the universality of
 human rights. They argue instead that a nation's political, economic, and social sys-
 tem and its unique historical, religious, and cultural background determine its con-
 cept of human rights.
 The Government remains reluctant to accept criticism of China's human rights
 situation by other nations or international organizations and often criticized reports
 by international human rights monitoring groups. To deflect attempts to discuss its
 
 
 588
 human rights record, the Government strongly opposed a resolution on China's
 human rights record at the 1995 session of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights
 (UNHRC). The Government introduced a motion to take no action on the resolution;
 this motion was rejected by the Commission. The resolution itself subsequently
 failed to pass by a single vote. Nevertheless, officials no longer dismiss all discussion
 of human rights as interference in China's internal affairs. Chinese authorities con-
 tinued a limited dialog with foreign governments on human rights issues in talks
 with a number of visiting delegations from other countries and also during visits
 abroad by Chinese leaders. China's pique at some governments' support for the
 China resolution at the 1995 UNHRC session, however, resulted in the suspension
 of bilateral human rights dialogs for the remainder of 1995. During the first half
 of the year, the Government provided limited information to a private person who
 requested information about the status of certain persons believed to be imprisoned
 for their political or religious beliefs. In the second half of the year, the Government
 did not respond to similar requests.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 There are laws designed to protect women children, the disabled, and minorities.
 In practice, however, societal discrimination based on ethnicity, gender, and disabil-
 ity as persisted. The concept of a largely homogeneous Chinese people pervades the
 thinking of the Han majority.
 Women.-Nationwide statistics on the extent of physical violence against women
 are not available, but the establishment of a Bejing women's hot line staffed by
 some 100 volunteers has focused attention on the problem. In April the Chairman
 of the China Academy of Management Science Institute of Women's Studies stated
 that domestic incidents have become beth more violent and more frequent in recent
 years. In March 1994, the Beijing Society for Research on Marri e and the Family
 published a survey of 2,100 families showing that one-fifth of  wives had been
 abused by their spouses. A government study indicated 2 percent of urban house-
 holds and 5 percent of ru    ones  ad serious problems with domestic violence.
 Ph sical abuse can be grounds for prosecution.
 The abdion of women is a serious and growing problem, especially in those
 areas where local officials have resisted efforts of the central authorities to stop it.
 The sdemand" for marriageable women is created by individuals who seek to start
 families but cannot find local brides. Some families address the problem by recruit-
 inf women in economically less advanced areas, receiving in effect, mal order
 brides. Others seek help from criminal gangs, which either idnap women or trick
 them by promising them jobs and an easier way of life and then transport them far
 from thenr home areas for delivery to buyers. Once in their new "family" these
 women are "married" and raped. Some accept their fate and join the new commu-
 nity; others struggle and are punished. Henan is among the country's main "recipi-
 eat" provinces of abducted women despite efforts of the province's Bureau of Public
 Security to control the problem.
 The Government ontinued to ondemn and t take steps to     revent and punish
 the abduction and sale of women for marriage or prostitution. he press reported
 in April that a Henan provincial court sentenced a 28-year-old man to 15 years in
 prison for buying, abducting, and raping a second-year Chinese literature student
 from an unidentified university in northwest China. In April the Anhui provincial
 procurator reported that 20 criminals were sentenced to death in 1994 for abducting
 and selling women and children. According to figures announced by the Ministry of
 Public Security in January 1994, there were over 15,000 cases of abduction and traf-
 ficking in women and children in 1993.
 One report from Inner Mongolia blamed part of the problem of abduction and sell-
 ing of women on a serious imbalance in sex ratios in one county, where there were
 115 men for every 100 women. (The question of male/female birth ratios and tradi-
 tional p references for boys is discussed in Section 1.f.) Although the authorities have
 enacted laws and conducted educational campaigns to eradicate the traditional prf-
 erenc for sons, in many areas this preference remains strong, especially in rural
 China. A number of provinces have souht to reduce the perceived higher value of
 boys in providing old-age support for thenr parents by establishing or improving pen-
 sions and retirement homes.
 The 1982 Constitution states that "women enjoy equal rights with men in all
 spheres of life, including ownership of property, inheritance rights, and access to
 education. In 1992 the NPC enacted legislation on the protection of the rights and
 interests of women Which was designed to assist in curoing gender-based discrimi-
 nation. Women have continued, however, to report discrimination, sexual harass-
 ment, unfair dismissal, demotion, and wage cuts.
 
 
 589
 Women are sometimes the unintended victims of reforms designed to streamline
 enterprises and give workers greater job mobility. The press reported that, accord-
 ing toa1995 survey by the Women's Research Institute of the Chinese Academy
 of-Management Science, women constituted 70 percent of persons fired or likely to
 be fired as a result of restructuring of unprofitable state enterprises. Women under
 age 35 or over age 45 were the moat affected, and the least likely to be retrained.
 In addition, female employees were more likely to be the ones chosen to take pay
 cuts when a plant or company was in financial trouble.
 Many employers prefer to hire men to avoid the expense of maternity leave and
 chld care, and some even lower the effective retirement age for women workers to
 40 years of age. (The official retirement age for men is 60 years and for women 55
 years.) Although the law promises equal pay for equal work, a 1990 survey found
 that women's salaries averaged 77 percent of men's. Official government responses
 to the State Department's 1994 report on human _rights practices in China implicitly
 recognized that those statistics remain accurate. Most women employed in industry
 work in lower skilled and lower paid jobs.
 While the gap in the education levels of men and women is narrowing, men con-
 tinue to constitute the majority of the educated, particulary the highly educated.
 For example, a governent wite paper reported that in 1992, women made up 33.7
 percent of college students and 24.8 percent of postgraduate students. From 1982
 to 1993, only 4.9 percent of doctoral degrees were awarded to women.
 In August and September, the Government hosted the U.N. Fourth World Con-
 ference on Women and an associated NGO Forum. Many wishing to participate
 questioned the motives of the host government when authorities delayed issuing
 confirmations for hotel accommodations and failed to issue visas in a timely man-
 ner, forcing hundreds to cancel plans to attend. Observers said that the extent to
 which the ~overnment exercised the sovereign right to limit visa issuance exceeded
 norms established at similar international meetings. The Government also abruptly
 changed the venue of the NGO Forum to Huairou, some 25 miles from Beijing. In
 addition to difficulties in traveling to and from Huairou, many participants felt that
 facilities at the new site were inadequate: hastily constructe  and acking appro-
 priate basic amenities. Participants with disabilities attending the NGO Forum
 foundthe lack of physical access to many areas uarticularly difficult.
 Woman's Conference and NGO Forum participants faced harassment and intimi-
 dation from security officials. Some participants reported being followed, videotaped
 photographed, or jostled by security agents. Others reported searches of personal
 possessions; several reported the loss of personal items and papers. In addition, the
 Government prmitted little of the copious international news media coverage of the
 Conference and the NGO Forum to rach a domestic audience. Foreign journalists
 were limited to covering the meetings, but were not permitted to pursue stories out-
 side the conference andaform sites
 Children.-The Constitution provides for 9 years of compulsory education for chil-
 drn. China's extensive health care delivery system has led to a sharp decline in
 national infant mortality rates and improved child health. According to the State
 Council's 1995 white paper on "Family Planning in China," China's infant mortality
 rate declined to 17.7 per 1,000 live births in 1994. There were credible reports of
 sex-selective abortion and female infanticide, but no reliable statistics were avail-
 able to demonstrate the extent of the problem. The Chinese press has reported that
 the national ratio of male to female births is 114 to 100, while the statistical norm
 is 106 to 100 (see Section 1.f.).
 Physical abuse of children can be grounds for criminal prosecution. The 1992 Law
 on the Protection of Juveniles forbi  anticide, as wellas mistreatment or aban-
 donment of children. This law also prohibits discrimination against disabled minors,
 emphasizes the importance of safety and morality, and codifies a variety of judicial
 protections for juvenile offenders. Despite government efforts to prevent the kidnap-
 ing and buying and selling of children, th~e problem persists in some rural areas.
 In March authorities in Guanxi Province reported that, as a result of 3 campaigns
 in the past 2 years against trading of children and women, police arrested 3,886
 criminais, smashed 595 criminal gangs, and released 134 children and 2,861 women.
 In February Chongqing authorities tried and convicted a gang that abducted and
 sold 80 infants and 5 women, earning approximately $15,000; 5 of the 35 gang mem-
 bers received the death penalty.
 According to a 1994 Bijing University demograpics study, the number of chil-
 dren abanone   in   ina each year is approximately 1.7 million, despite the fact
 that under the law child abandonment is punishable by ines and a 5-year prison
 term. Thle vast majority of the approximately 100,000 children who are eventually
 admitted to Chinese orphanages everyyear are female or disabled. The treatment
 of children at orphanages varies from deplorable to adequate. Ther hae been re-
 
 
 ports of children being restrained for long periods of time and being denied basic
 care and feeding. Diferences among available statistics make accurate determina-
 tion of infant mortality rates in orphanages difficult, but rates appear to be very
 high at many orphanages, especiafly among new arrivals. Human Rights Watc
 cites Ministry of Civil Affairs statistics for 1989-90 that put infant mortality in or-
 phanages in 10 provinces at over 50 percent.
 According to several sources, orphanage workers practice triage and reserve basic
 medical care and even nutrition for children who are deemed to have the best
 chances for survival. Some sources report that children whose prospects are deter-
 mined to be poor are placed in rooms separate from other chiddren and subjected
 to extreme neglect. Claims that government policies, as opposed to lack of resources,
 were to blame for the lack of care of children placed in orphanages could not be veri-
 fied. A 1996 Human Rights Watch report, however, alleges that many orphanages,
 including those with the highest death rates have budgets that provide for ade-
 quate wages, bonuses, and other personnel-related costs, but that budgets for chil-
 n's foo   clothing, and other necessities are extremely low in institutions
 throughout the country. The Government denies that orphans are mistreated or re-
 fused medical care, but acknowledges that the orphanage system is hard pressed to
 provide for those children who are admitted with serious medical problems.
 People With Disabilities.-In 1990 China adopted legislation protecting the rights
 of China's approximately 55 million disabled. However, as with many other aspects
 of Chinese society, reality for the disabled lags far behind the legal provisions. Mis-
 diagnosis, inadequate medical care, pariah status, and abandonment remain com-
 mon problems for the disabled population.
 Statistics on education compiled in 1994 reveal the inequity of resources afforded
 the disabled: only 6 percent of disabled school children received primary education.
 The illiteracy rate among the disabled is 60 percent, and school attendance rates
 avera ed ony 20 percent for blind, deaf, or mentally retarded children. According
 to a .eptember press report, the Government responded to the problem by budget-
 ing $21.6 million to establish the nation's first university exclusively for disabled
 persons, in northern Shandong province. The school reportedly will offer courses in
 law, finance, computers, and other subjects.
 In May 1994, Deng Pufang, son of retired senior leader Deng Xiaoping and head
 of the China Welfare Fund or the Handicapped, said that his organization hoped
 to assist the disabled by providing rehabilitation services to 3 million people, raising
 school enrollment rates for disabled people to 80 percent, and increasing their em-
 ployment rate to 80 percent by the year 2000. The Government requires all state
 enterprises to hire a certain number of disabled workers, but authorities estimate
 40 percent of disabled people are jobless.
 Standards adopted in May 1994 for making roads and buildings accessible to the
 disabled are subject to the dictates of the 1990 Law on the Handicapped, which calls
 for their "gradual" implementation. Lax compliance to date has resulted in only lim-
 ited access to most buildings. Facilities built for the U.N. Fourth World Conference
 on Women and NGO Forum highlighted the problem. The authorities promised that
 all housing and meeting areas would be accessible to the disabled, but some of the
 200 disabled persons who attended reported many facilities lacked ramps, elevators,
 and other modifications nesessary to facilitate access.
 The new Maternal and Child Health Care Law became effective in mid-1995. It
 forbids the marriage of persons with certain specified contagious diseases or certain
 acute mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. If doctors find that a couple is at risk
 of transmitting disabling congenital defects to their children, the couple may marry
 only if they agree to use birth control or undergo sterilization. This law mandates
 premarital and prenatal examination for genetic or contagious diseases, but it speci-
 fies that medically advised abortion or sterilization requires the signed consent of
 the patients or their guardians.
 NationallRaciallEthnic Minorities-The 55 designated ethnic minorities con-
 stitute about 8 percent of China's total population. Most minority $roups reside in
 areas they have traditionally inhabited, many of which are mountainous or remote.
 China's minorities policy calls for preferential treatment in marriage policy, family
 planning, university admission, and employment. The Government has programs to
 provide low interest loans, subsidies, and special development funds for minority
 areas. While these government development policies have helped improve minority
 living standards in recent years, incomes in many minority areas remain well below
 the national average. Development programs have also disrupted traditional living
 patterns of minority groups, including Tibetans and the Muslim Uighur majority of
 Westerniiang.
 In the area of education, the Government has tried to adopt policies responsive
 to minority concerns. In many areas with a significant population of minorities,
 
 
 591
 there are two-track school systems using either standard Chinese or the local minor-
 i  lan  age. Students can choose which system to attend. One acknowledged side
 effect of this policy designed to protect and maintain minority cultures has been re-
 inforcement of a segregated society. Under this separate education system, those
 graduating from minority schools are at a disadvantage in competing for jobs in gov-
 ernment and business, which require good spoken Chinese. These graduates must
 take Chinese language instruction before attending universities and colleges (see
 also Tibet addendum).
 The Communist Party has an avowed policy of boosting minority representation
 in the Government and the party. Many members of minorities occupy local leader-
 ship slots, and a few have positions at the national level. However, in most areas,
 ethnic minorities are effectively shut out of most positions of real political and deci-
 sionmaking power. Some minorities resent Han officials holding key positions in mi-
 nority autonomous regions. Ethnic minorities in Tibet, Xinjiang, and elsewhere have
 at times demonstrated against Han Chinese authority. Central authorities have
 made it clear that they wil not tolerate opposition to Communist Party rule in mi-
 nority regions and have responded to unrest with force and heightened security
 measures.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1982 Constitution provides for "freedom of asso-
 ciation," but qualifying language makes it clear that this right is subject to the in-
 terest of the State and the leadership of the Communist Party. The country's sole
 officially recognized workers' organization, the All-China Federation of Trade
 Unions (ACFTU), is controlled by the Communist Party. Independent trade unions
 are illegal. Although ACFTU officials recognize that workers' interests may not al-
 ways coincide with those of the Communist Party, the ACFTU's primary goals re-
 main to improve labor discipline and mobilize workers to achieve party and govern-
 ment objectives. The 1993 revised Trade Union Law required that the establishment
 of unions at any level be submitted to a higher level trade union organization for
 approval. The ACFTU, the highest level organization, has not approved the estab-
 lishment of independent unions. Attempts to form or register independent unions
 have been severely repressed. There are no provisions allowing for individual work-
 ers or unofficial worker organizations to affiliate with international bodies.
 The ACFTU's primary attention remains focused on state sector workers. The
 Trade Union Law mandates that workers may decide whether to join the union in
 their enterprise. By official estimate, 8 percent of workers in ollective and state-
 owned enterprises have chosen for their own reasons not to join. There have been
 no reports of repercussions for workers who have not joined ACFTU unions. Diver-
 sification of enterprise types over the last decade of reform has vastly increased the
 number of workers outside the traditional sphere of the ACF'TU. Over half of Chi-
 na's nonagricultural work force is now largely unorganized and outside the state in-
 dustrial structure, in collectives, township and village enterprises, private and indi-
 vidual enterprises, and foreign investment enterprises. In township and village en-
 terprises, one of the fastest growing sectors of the economy, only a tiny percentage
 of workers are organized in ACFTU affiliates. Workers in companies with foreign
 investors are provided with the right to form unions, which must affiliate with the
 ACFTU. As of September 1995, according to an ACFTU survey, 86 percent of for-
 eign-invested enterprises had union branches. Anecdotal evidence, however, indi-
 cates union influence in such enterprises is weak.
 Credible reports indicate the Government has attempted to stamp out illegal
 union activity. Since China joined the International Labor Organization (ILO) in
 1983, three complaints have been lodged against it with the ILO's Committee on
 Freedom of Association. The most recent complaint (No. 1819) was lodged by the
 International Transport Federation in 1993 on behalf of three Chinese seamen who
 were arrested by security officials in the city of Tianjin because of their involvement
 in a wage dispute. The authorities have since released the three seamen, but the
 ILO is still awaiting an official reply from the Government of China to the com-
 plaint. In the other earlier two complaints, the International Confederation of Free
 rade Unions charged China with illegally arresting independent union organizers
 following its crackdown on Tiananmen Square demonstrators in June 1989.
 In March 1994, a petition calling for workers to have "freedom from exploitation,"
 the right to strike, and the right to organize nonofficial trade unions was circulated
 in Beijing. The authorities detained Zhou Guoqiang, Yuan Hongbing, and Wang
 Jiaqi after they presented the petition. Zhou is an associate of Han Dongfang, the
 leader of the Beijing Autonomous Workers' Federation. He was sentenced in Sep-
 tember 1994 to 3 years' reeducation through labor, although the charges against
 him were reportedly not linked to the petition (see Section 2.d.). Accurate figures
 
 
 592
 are not available on the number of Beijing Autonomous Workers' Federation detain-
 ees still being held for their participation in the 1989 Tiananmen Square dem-
 onstrations.
 The right to strike, which had been included in China's 1975 and 1978 constitu-
 tions, was removed from the 1982 Constitution on the grounds that the Socialist po-
 litical system had eradicated contradictions between te proletariat and enterprise
 owners. The Trade Union Law assigns unions the role of mediators or go-betweens
 with management in cases of work stoppages or slowdowns. Beginn   in 1993, the
 Ministry of Labor stopped officially denying the existence of strikes. Strikes are still
 not officially sanctioned, and accurate statistics on strike incidents are not available.
 Work stoppages did occur, however, in several locations during 1995. In one case
 reported in August by the official press, 600 female workers at a South Korean
 clothing factory in Hebei Province initiated a work stoppage to protest excessive
 overtime hours. Documented instances of work stoppages also occurred in Special
 Economic Zones (SEZ's) in south China during 1995.
 A dispute settlement procedure has been in effect since 1987. The procedure pro-
 vides for mediation, two levels of arbitration committees, and a final appeal to the
 courts. According to official statistics based on National Mediation Center and Labor
 Bureau records, labor disputes increased by approximately 65 percent in 1994. This
 followed a 50 percent increase during 1993. Most cases are solved through arbitra-
 tion and very few reach the courts. According to Labor Ministry officials, most arbi-
 tration cases are filed by contract workers or their employers. During the first 6
 months of 1995, 12,956 labor disputes were brought before arbitration committees,
 a 66 percent increase over the same period in 1994.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The National Labor Law,
 which took effect on January 1, permnts workers in all types of enterprises to bar-
 gain collectively. This law supersedes a 1988 law that allowed collective bargaining
 only by workers in private enterprises. The Labor Law provides for workers and em-
 ployers at all types of enterprises to sign individual as well as collective contracts.
 ollective contracts are to be worked out between ACFTU or worker representatives
 and management and specify such matters as working conditions, wage distribution,
 and hours of work. Individual contracts are then to be drawn up in line with the
 terms of the collective contract. Collective contracts must be submitted to local gov-
 ernment authorities for approval within 15 days.
 To date, union and labor officials report the initiation of only a few experiments
 in collective bargaining. Official sources have explained that sufficient ideological
 and practical difficulties remain to preclude drawing clear distinctions between
 labor and capital in China's state-owned enterprise sector. According to the ACFTU,
 collective bargaining will first be implemented mostly in foreign investment enter-
 prises where capital interests are clearly delineated.
 The Ministry of Labor sets a total wage bill for each collective and state-owned
 enterprise acording to four criteria: 1) as a percentage of profits, 2) as a contract
 amount with the local labor bureau, 3) for money losing enterprises, according to
 a state-set amount, or 4) as an enterprise-set amount subject to Labor Ministry re-
 view. Individual enterprises datermine how to divide the total among workers, a de-
 cision usually made by the enterprise manager in consultation with the enterprise
 party chief and the ACFTU representative. Worker congresses have mandated au-
 thority to review plans for wage reform, although these bodies serve primarily as
 rubber-stamp organizations. Wages are generally equal for the same type of work
 within enterprises. Incentives are provided for increased productivity. Under the
 new Labor Law, wages may be set according to conditions set out in collective con-
 tracts negotiated between ACFTU representatives and management. However, in
 practice only the small number of workers with high technical skills can negotiate
 effectively on salary and fringe benefits.
 Worker congresses, held periodically in most Chinese enterprises, theoretically
 have the authority to remove incompetent managers and approve major decisions
 affecting the enterprise, notably wage and bonus distribution systems. However,
 worker congresses generally take place only once a year and serve essentially to ap-
 prove agreements worked out among factory managers, party secretaries, and
 ACFTU representatives. In smaller enterprises it is not unusual to find these three
 posts held-by the same person. The Trade Union Law prohibits antiunion discrimi-
 nation and specifies that union representatives may not be transferred or termi-
 nated by enterprise management during their term of office. Unionized foreign busi-
 nesses generally report pragmatic relations with ACFTU representatives. As of Sep-
 tember 1995, 42,327 foreign-invested enterprises had union branches-about 86 per-
 cent of all such enterprises nationally.
 Laws governing working conditions in SEZ's are not significantly different from
 those in the rest of the country. However, wages in the SEZ's, and in southeastern
 
 
 593
 China generally, are significantly higher than in other parts of the country because
 of high investment and profit levels. As in other areas of China, officials admit that
 some foreign investors in SEZ's are able to negotiate "sweetheart" deals with local
 partners which effectively bypass labor regulations.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.--Some penal facilities contract with
 regular industries for prisoners to perform light manufacturing and assembly work.
 In 1991 the Government published a reiteration of its regulations barring the export
 of prison-made goods. On August 7, 1992, the U.S. and Chinese Governments signed
 a memorandum of understanding (MOU) prohibiting trade in prison labor products.
 A statement of cooperation (SOC) detailing specific working procedures for imple-
 mentation of the MOU was agreed to and signed on March 14, 1994. Although the
 signing of the SOC initially helped to foster a more productive relationship with
 Chinese authorities, cooperation has stalled since mid-1995. As of the end of 1995,
 the authorities had not granted access to a prison labor facility since April 30. Re-
 peated delays in arranging prison labor site visits called into question Chinese in-
 tentions regarding the implementation of the MOU and SOC. For example, authori-
 ties refused repeated requests (the first was made on May 30) to visit the Wuyi
 plant in Zhejiang Province, despite the terms of the SOC requiring a visit within
 60 days of a request.
 In addition to prisons and reform through labor facilities, which contain inmates
 sentenced through judicial procedures, China also maintains a network of reeduca-
 tion through labor camps, where inmates are sentenced through nonjudicial proce-
 dures (see Section I.e.). Inmates of reeducation through labor facilities are generally
 required to work, but the authorities do not regard the facilities as prisons and have
 denied access to them under the 1992 prison labor MOU. Reports from international
 human rights organizations and the foreign press indicate that at least some per-
 sons in pretrial detention are also required to work.
 Justice officials have stated that in reeducation through labor facilities there is
 a much heavier emphasis on education than on labor. Most reports conclude that
 work conditions in the penal system's light manufacturing factories are similar to
 those in ordinary factories, but conditions on farms and in mines can be harsh. As
 in many Chinese workplaces, safety is a low priority. There are no available figures
 for casualties in prison industry.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The 1995 National Labor Law
 specifies that "no employing unit shall be allowed to recruit juveniles under the age
 of 16." Administrative review, fines, and revocation of business licenses of those
 businesses that hire minors are specified in Article 94 of the Labor Law. The Con-
 stitution provides for children to receive 9 years of compulsory education and to re-
 ceive their subsistence from parents or guardians. Laborers between the ages of 16
 and 18 are referred to as "juvenile workers" and are prohibited from engaging in
 certain forms of physical work including labor in mines.
 The Labor Law mandates the establishment of labor inspection corps at all ad-
 ministrative levels above county government. However, the rapid growth of China's
 nonstate sector has outpaced the evolution of government regulatory structures and
 resulted in inadequate labor inspection and enforcement regimes. In poorer, isolated
 areas, child labor in agriculture is widespread, given the few options available to
 minors who have completed their primary school education at approximately 13
 years of age. China's vast reserve of surplus adult labor, however, minimizes the
 incentive to employ children. Most independent observers agree with Chinese offi-
 cials that urban child labor is a relatively small problem in formal sectors of the
 economy. Rising dropout rates at secondary schools in some southern provinces and
 anecdotal reports suggest that children may increasingly be entering unregulated
 sectors of the economy. No specific industry is identifiable as a significant violator
 of child labor regulations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Law codifies many of the general
 principles of China's labor reform, setting out provisions on employment, labor con-
 tracts, working hours, wages, skill development and training, social insurance, dis-
 pute resolution, legal responsibility, supervision, and inspection. There is no na-
 tional minimum wage. Rather, the Labor Law allows local governments to deter-
 mine their own standards on minimum wages. In general, minimum wage level de-
 terminations are higher than the local poverty relief ceiling but lower than the cur-
 rent wage level of the average worker.
 Wages are in general paid and calculated monthly. The monthly minimum wage
 in Beijing is approximately $29 (rmb 240). In the SEZ of Zhuhai in south China thge
 monthly minimum wage is approximately $46 (rmb 380). These wage levels are
 slightly greater than average living expenditures according to official statistics. Min-
 imum wage figures do not include free or heavily subsidized benefits that employers
 
 
 594
 may provide in kind, such as housing, medical care, and education. In poorer, rural
 areas monthly minimum wage levels are as low as $14 (rmb 120).
 In May China reduced the national standard workweek from 44 hours to 40 hours
 excluding overtime. The Labor Law mandates a 24-hour rest period weekly and does
 not allow overtime work in excess of 3 hours a day or 36 hours a month. It also
 sets forth a required scale of remuneration for overtime work. Enforcement of regu-
 lations regarding overtime work varies according to region and type of enterprise.
 The press regularly reports cases of workers forced to work long overtime hours at
 sma-scale foreign investment enterprises, particularly in southeast China and the
 SEZ's. Abuses at private enterprises are sometimes given coverage.
 Occupational health and safety are constant themes of posters and campaigns.
 Every work unit must designate a health and safety officer, and the ILO has estab-
 lished a training program for these officials. Although the 1982 Constitution does
 not provide for the right to strike, the Trade Union Law explicitly recognizes the
 right of unions to "suggest that staff and workers withdraw from sites of danger'
 and participate in accident investigations. It is unclear, however, to what extent
 workers can actually remove themselves from such dangerous situations without
 risking loss of employment.
 Nonetheless, pressures for increased output, lack of fimancial resources to main-
 tain equipment, lack of concern by management, and a traditionally poor under-
 standing of safety issues by workers have contributed to a continuing high rate of
 accidents. Official statistics indicate that 20,263 workers were killed in industrial
 accidents during 1994, up from 14,288 in 1993. Deaths from industrial accidents
 during the first 5 months of 1995 stood at 6,656. One credible report indicates that
 there are over 10,000 miners killed yearly. Fires, mostly in entertainment establish-
 ments and factories, killed 2,000 people in 1994, according to official statistics. Poor
 enforcement by local officials of occupational safety and health regulations puts the
 lives of workers at risk. Over 30 million Chinese work in toxic environments. Less
 than half of rural enterprises meet national dust and poison standards. In addition,
 many factories using harmful products, such as asbestos, fail not only to protect
 their workers against the ill effects of such products, but also fail to inform them
 about the potential hazards. Although work safety issues have attracted the atten-
 tion of senior government leaders, supervision of both local and foreign small-scale
 private enterprises, where most accidents occur, remains poor.
