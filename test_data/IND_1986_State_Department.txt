 INDIA
 India is a secular, democratic republic with a political
 structure mixing Indian political traditions with aspects of
 the British parliamentary system. Free elections are held
 regularly. The last general elections were held on December
 24, 1984.
 Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress (I) Party holds almost
 80 percent of the seats in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of
 India's Parliament. It also controls the upper house (Rajya
 Sabha) and the legislatures of 11 of the 24 states, and
 participates in the ruling coalition of one more state. The
 state government of Mizoram was dissolved in August to make
 room for an interim coalition government as part of a
 political settlement designed to end the 20-year old Mizo
 insurgency. Also, negotiations between center and state
 politicians led to the end of direct rule from New Delhi and
 the reinstatement of Farooq Abdullah as Chief Minister of the
 state of Jammu and Kashmir in November and an agreement to
 hold elections in the spring of 1987.
 The Indian economy is mixed. Banks, air and rail transport,
 public utilities, and much heavy industry are owned and
 operated by either the central or state governments. The
 agricultural sector, manufacture of consumer goods, and
 services other than financial are largely in private' hands.
 Some rules regulating private economic activity have been
 relaxed under the present administration.
 India is a secular state. Approximately 83 percent of its
 population are Hindus and 11 percent Muslims with smaller
 proportions of Jains, Buddhists, Christians, Parsis, Sikhs,
 and animists.
 The most serious human rights concerns in India in 1986 were
 due to the intercaste violence linked to criminal elements,
 especially in the state of Bihar; the continuing violence in
 the Punjab; the emergence of communal and quasi-religious
 gangs as a political force; and the difficulty of controlling
 and punishing police mistreatment of arrested suspects.
 Social tension in Bihar has given rise to extralegal violence
 by some landlords with links to criminal elements and
 politicians, sometimes in league with local police, against
 disadvantaged classes seeking improved economic and social
 conditions. Two multiple killings attracted press and public
 attention. The state government has yet to demonstrate its
 effectiveness in either controlling the violence or resolving
 the underlying social tensions.
 In the Punjab, the Akali Dal government of Surjit Singh
 Barnala has stayed in power with the support of the Congress
 (I) in spite of splits within the Akali Dal. The center and
 state governments continue to wrestle with the implementation
 of the Punjab Accord--the agreement reached in 1985 containing
 provisions for settling the major points of contention between
 the Sikhs and the Government--which is hampered by the
 competing demands of various interested parties. Sustained
 police action under emergency powers brought an apparent
 reduction in the overall level of political violence in that
 state, but the murder of 22 bus passengers by Sikh terrorists
 November 30 heralded an upsurge of violence at the end of the
 year. G. S. Tohra, a member of the breakaway Akali Dal (B)
 faction opposed to the Barnala government, was arrested
 December 2 along with several others on charges of supportinq

 terrorism and advocating violence. On December 5 the Punjab
 and center governments promulgated new rules under the existing
 Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act of 1986,
 giving them sweeping new powers to combat terrorism, including
 providing for the death penalty for terrorist acts resulting
 in the death of the victims, authorizing the tapping or
 disconnection of the telephones of suspected supporters of
 terrorist acts, and prohibiting the publication of material
 derived from terrorist-related sources.
 Some political leaders in Punjab claim that police efforts
 have resulted in the deaths of persons with no clear terrorist
 connection. This claim is disputed by police authorities.
 The level of terrorism elsewhere related to the Punjab has
 declined, although incidents such as the murder of retired
 Army Chief of Staff General A. S. Vaidya in August and the
 October 2 attempt to assassinate Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
 continue to plague India.
 Major Hindu-Muslim communal violence occurred during the year
 in Ahmedabad, Allahabad, and Bangalore. Hindu-Sikh clashes in
 Delhi occurred periodically, including after the murder of
 several bus passengers in the Punjab in August. From time to
 time reports continue to appear in the press of murders of
 untouchables by higher-caste Hindus.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The Government does not engage in political killing. On the
 other hand, political action in India often involves violence.
 Violence which on the surface seems to be communal or caste-
 related often has political links.
 Intercaste and political violence in the eastern state of
 Bihar was reported prominently in the press during the year.
 In April 23 people were killed by police at the village of
 Arwal. While police claim that a mob was attacking a station,
 some observers report that the crowd was holding a rally in a
 schoolyard. In July 10 lower-caste people in Kansara village
 were killed by upper-caste people, reportedly in retaliation
 for the murder of a landlord over fishing rights. The police
 did not begin their investigation until 48 hours after the
 killings. Some observers note a nexus between certain
 politicians, criminal gangs, and some landlords in rural areas,
 using private armies and local police to resist demands for
 social and economic change. According to several press
 reports, 77 persons died in clashes with Bihar police over a
 12-month period; over 2,100 attacks against lower-caste
 persons were reported. In turn, lower castes have increasingly
 joined the activities of radical organizations. The Bihar
 state government has not been effective in coping with the
 violence. The state assembly, in which sit some politicians
 associated in the press with these abuses, denied a motion to
 debate the Arwal massacre. Two ultra-leftist organizations in
 August organized a "gherao" (a form of protest) over the Arwal
 massacre. The state government banned these organizations and
 detained more than 18,000 of their members throughout the
 state. The state then banned all private armies in Bihar, but
 many apparently continue to operate.
 
 
 1148
 INDIA
 In the Punjab, both Hindus and Sikhs continue to be victims of
 violence. Sikh terrorist organizations appear to be
 systematically targeting local Hindu political and community
 leaders. The Government, during the most recent session of
 Parliament, passed a law allowing the report of the commission
 charged with investigating the 1984 anti-Sikh riots to remain
 secret. The Government has not yet begun prosecuting persons
 believed to have instigated these riots.
 In West Bengal, armed state police and supporters of the
 ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the cadre and
 supporters of the so-called Gorkha National Liberation Front
 regularly resort to violent action in connection with the
 agitation for autonomy for Nepali-speaking areas.
 Law and order in the Indian system is primarily the
 responsibility of the various states. The quality, training,
 and even-handedness of police vary from state to state, as
 does the willingness of political authorities to restrain
 political violence. The decision to institute judicial
 proceedings in cases of politically related violence also
 often appears to be heavily political. In any event, judicial
 processes are lengthy.
 b. Disappearance
 Some Sikhs claim that the Government has not yet accounted for
 a small number of people seized during the Golden Temple
 operations in 1984 and subsequent security operations in the
 Punjab.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture and cruel treatment are prohibited by law in India.
 Indian case law excludes confessions or information extracted
 through the use of force or torture from being admitted in
 court. Throughout 1986, however, the press continued to
 report abuse of prisoners and suspects by police in many
 Indian states. In December 1985, the disclosure of the
 blinding of 31 persons awaiting trial in Bihar, which had
 occurred in 1980 and 1981, led to the suspension of 16
 officers. The officer who reported the allegations was
 allegedly among those suspended. The Indian press continues
 to cite the police in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh as
 particularly brutal. In January the death in police custody
 in Delhi of a young Sikh accused of harboring a suspect
 involved in a political assassination raised charges by human
 rights organizations, members of Parliament, and the press
 that his death resulted from torture. Other reports accused
 the police of staging fake encounters with terrorists to cover
 up deaths in police custody and attributing deaths in custody
 to incorrect causes. In a violent incident outside a Sikh
 temple in New Delhi December 5, a truck with four occupants,
 apparently Sikhs, ploughed through police lines and crushed to
 death three members of the Central Reserve Police Force.
 Police fired to control the crowd, killing several people,
 and, in defiance of Delhi police orders, beat to death one of
 the truck's occupants. While center and state governments do
 not formally condone police abuses, there have been few
 official inquiries into such incidents and allegations.
 Prisons are crowded, prison conditions are poor, and pretrial
 detention may last for an extended period of time. Press
 
 
 1149
 INDIA
 reports include claims of sexual abuse of female prisoners and
 use of prisoners by prison officials for domestic labor. The
 penal system grants different privileges to different
 categories of prisoners. Political prisoners and foreign
 nationals are provided less crowded cells, better food, and
 some amenities such as access to publications. Governmental
 response to charges of police brutality varies from state to
 state.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Constitution, an arrested person must be informed of
 the grounds for arrest, given the right to be represented by
 counsel, and produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of
 arrest. At this initial appearance the accused must be either
 remanded for further investigation or released. These
 provisions are generally respected.
 The enactment of preventive detention laws in the event of
 threats to public welfare and national security is permitted
 under the Constitution. Such laws provide for limits on the
 length of detention, usually 12 months, and for judicial
 review of such detention. Two such laws are in force. One
 permits arrest of economic offenders; this is rarely used.
 The second, the National Security Act (NSA), permits detention
 of security risks. To be released from detention under this
 law, a court must determine that all grounds for detention are
 invalid. Upon expiration of the detention order, an additional
 order can be issued for another 12 months, making it
 theoretically possible for a detainee to be held indefinitely
 without trial. The NSA has been used in the Punjab, but most
 of those held have been released by the state government. The
 union government has, however, kept 360 persons arrested
 during Operation Bluestar (the June 1984 army action at the
 Golden Temple, the Sikh's holiest shrine) in detention without
 charges at Jodhpur (Rajasthan) jail.
 Incommunicado detention is practiced under the Terrorist
 Affected Areas Act, which applies to the Punjab and Chandigarh.
 All detainees have the right to have their detention reviewed
 by courts.
 Exile is not practiced as a punishment in India. Forced labor
 is in effect prohibited by constitutional provisions
 establishing the "right against exploitation" as a fundamental
 right of Indian citizens and is not used as a form of
 punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Indian Criminal Procedure Code provides for open trial in
 most cases but allows the judiciary, under certain
 circumstances, to close proceedings. Such circumstances
 include proceedings involving official secrets or trials in
 which statements prejudicial to the safety of the State might
 be made. Sentences must, however, be announced in public.
 Generally, Indian legal procedures assure a fair trial,
 although the process can be drawn out. Defendants have the
 right to choose counsel from an Indian bar that is fully
 independent of the Government. Effective appeals channels
 exist at all levels of the judicial system.
 The vigor of the Indian judicial system is demonstrated by the
 active and comprehensive defense and appeals process being
 
 
 1150
 INDIA
 provided those accused of the murder of the late Prime
 Minister Indira Gandhi, certainly by far the most prominent
 judicial proceeding in the past decade. There were no reports
 of any prosecutions in 1986 under the 1984 Terrorist Affected
 Areas Act, which had brought special courts and judicial
 procedures to cases in areas with widespread and prolonged
 civil disturbances.
 Courts martial have continued to try Sikh military personnel
 who deserted after the 1984 raid on the Golden Temple. The
 Punjab Accord calls for a "rehabilitation process" to be
 provided for those discharged from the army after their
 desertion. Major progress has been made in carrying out this
 process, and the army has agreed to extend full benefits of
 army group insurance to the families of those soldiers who
 were killed following their desertion in June 1984.
 Judges in the Indian judicial system are selected by the Law
 Ministry following consultations with the Chief Justice of the
 Supreme Court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under Indian law, warrants are normally required for searches
 and seizures. In a criminal investigation, however, police
 may conduct searches if there would be undue delay, but must
 justify search without a warrant in writing. There have been
 no reports that this right is abused. Unannounced midnight
 raids on homes and businesses by tax authorities to seize
 records and evidence drew criticism in 1986; procedures for
 such raids reportedly have since been modified. Under
 "Disturbed Areas Legislation," the authorities continue to
 have special powers in the Punjab to search and arrest without
 warrant and to shoot to kill under certain circumstances.
 Surveillance of communications, including tapping telephones
 and intercepting personal mail, is authorized by law "on the
 occurrence of any public emergency or in the interest of the
 public safety or tranquility." Censorship of mail is legal in
 certain circumstances, such as a public emergency. Except in
 these circumstances, the Government does not normally interfere
 in the private lives of Indian citizens.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees the right of free speech. Freedom
 of the press is derived by extension of freedom of speech.
 The Government can proscribe printed material which in its
 view may incite religious or communal hatred.
 Films -are reviewed by a film censorship board before being
 licensed for distribution. The board censors material deemed
 overly violent or offensive to either public morals or to
 religious or communal sentiment. Radio and television are
 government monopolies. Opposition parties often accuse both
 media of favoring the ruling party.
 The print media reflect the full spectrum of opposition
 viewpoints. Many parties control their own papers or
 journals. There are no restrictions on criticism of the
 Government in the lively and free Indian press.
 
 
 1151
 INDIA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution protects the right of peaceful assembly and
 the right to form associations, including unions. These
 rights are respected. Government authorities sometimes
 require permits and notification prior to holding parades and
 demonstrations. At times of civil tension, local governments
 can ban public assemblies and impose curfew. Ordinarily,
 governments respect the right to protest peacefully, including
 such traditional Indian forms of protest as "gherao," in which
 an office is surrounded by protesters who allow nobody to
 enter or leave, and sit-downs blocking public thoroughfares.
 The Industrial Disputes Act of 1947 and the Indian Trade Union
 Act of 1926 established the right for labor to organize,
 bargain collectively, and strike. Under the Essential
 Services Maintenance Act, the Government can ban strikes and
 require conciliation or arbitration in 16 essential
 industries. Five percent, or approximately 14 million, of
 India's work force belong to labor unions. This represents
 roughly half of the workers in the so-called modern industrial
 sector of the economy. Four-fifths of India's work force,
 however, is in the rural sector, where organization is
 difficult. The Government, labor unions, and employer
 organizations all play a role in developing labor policy and
 industrial relations norms.
 Unions and professional bodies are free to maintain contact
 with international bodies. The Indian National Trade Union
 Congress and the Hind Mazdoor Sabha are affiliated with the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. The
 All-India Trade Union Congress, associated with the Communist
 Party of India, is affiliated with the Soviet-supported World
 Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) and the Centre of Indian
 Trade Unions, associated with the Communist Party of India
 (Marxist), attends WFTU meetings as an observer. In recent
 years Indian unions have complained several times to the
 International Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee on Freedom
 of Association, charging violations of ILO conventions and
 recommendations. Such complaints are usually presented by the
 Marxist unions. The Government has cooperated in the
 Committee's investigations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 India is a secular state in which all religious groups have
 the full right to worship freely. Government policy normally
 does not favor any one religious group, but communal tensions
 based on religious differences continue to be a social problem
 and pose challenges to the overall secular posture of the
 Indian polity.
 There is no bar to proselytizing by Indian Christians, but the
 Government appears to be limiting the number of foreign
 missionaries. During 1986 some foreign missionaries engaged
 in social work among disadvantaged communities were expelled
 on the orders of state governments. Indian religious
 organizations may maintain communication with coreligionists
 abroad. Financial contributions from abroad are subject to
 scrutiny and licensing by the Ministry of Home Affairs. In a
 case that attracted national attention and produced political
 controversy, the Supreme Court ruled that two students of the
 Jehovah's Witness faith could not be expelled from school for
 refusing to sing the Indian national anthem.
 
 
 1152
 INDIA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Indian citizens enjoy full freedom of movement within the
 country, except in certain sensitive border areas for which
 special permits are required. Foreign travel and emigration
 are without political restrictions. Millions of people of
 Indian origin now live abroad.
 To enter India, a visa is required of almost every person who
 is not an Indian citizen. Foreigners must obtain special
 permission to visit the Punjab and are prohibited from
 visiting sensitive border areas. Foreign journalists
 accredited to India may travel to Punjab without prior
 permission.
 India has admitted millions of refugees and displaced persons
 since 1947 and accepted most for citizenship, integrating them
 fully into Indian society. The most recent migrations have
 been from Bangladesh into Assam and other northeastern states
 and from Sri Lanka into Tamil Nadu. The Assam state
 government has undertaken to identify foreigners who have
 entered that state with a view towards repatriating them.
 Tamils from Sri Lanka in Tamil Nadu are provided shelter and
 subsistence by the Government.
 In addition, several thousand Afghans have entered India since
 the Soviet invasion in 1979. India does not recognize them as
 refugees, but there has been no evidence of forcible
 repatriation. Many have traveled onwards from India to third
 countries.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Indian people clearly rule in India through a multilayered
 but firmly democratic parliamentary system. The Constitution
 provides for full adult universal suffrage. Elections are
 held regularly at every level. A parliament can be constituted
 for not more than 5 years.
 On the advice of the Prime Minister, the President can declare
 "President's Rule," i.e., a state of emergency, in the event
 of war, external aggression, internal disruption, collapse of
 the constitutional machinery in any state, or financial
 breakdown of the central or any state government. President's
 rule was established in the state of Jammu and Kashmir in
 September 1986, following 6 months of Governor's Rule, but
 state control was reinstituted in November.
 Although the ruling Congress (I) Party holds a firm majority
 of seats in Parliament and in 11 of India's 24 state
 governments, it faces an articulate and active, if fragmented,
 political opposition. Parties represent a broad range of the
 political spectrum and a full mix of ethnic, linguistic, and
 religious outlooks.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no reports of international investigations of human
 rights problems in India during 1986. India is a member of
 the U.N. Human Rights Commission. Independent Indian human
 
 
 1153
 
 INDIA
 rights organizations include the People's Union for Civil
 Liberties and the People's Union for Democratic Rights, which
 send teams to study specific incidents involving alleged human
 rights abuses. Some press reports claim that on occasion
 representatives of human rights organizations are hbrassed by
 state governments who regard their activities as politically
 sensitive and thus "subversive."
 Several women's groups monitor the status of women. During
 1986 they continued their agitations against "dowry deaths,"
 and participated in the political discussion regarding
 legislation that reaffirmed the applicability of traditional
 Muslim law to marriage and divorce within India's large Muslim
 minority. The most active independent channels for addressing
 human rights issues continue to be the Parliament and the very
 active Indian press. Members of Parliament investigate
 allegations of police brutality, exploitation of and violence
 towards members of the lower castes and untouchables, tribal
 policy, women's rights, and violations of Sikhs' human rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Indian law guarantees women equal rights and legal protection.
 Nonetheless, there has been a decline in the ratio of women to
 men in the population. Female infant mortality is higher and
 women die earlier than men. These factors relate to the
 higher economic and social value placed upon males and the
 relative neglect given women's nutritional and health needs.
 In recent years, attention has been focused on the practice of
 "dowry deaths," i.e., deaths under suspicious circumstances of
 women unable to provide the additional dowry sometimes
 demanded by the husband's family after marriage. Increasing
 attention to this phenomenon has encouraged police to
 investigate these cases as murders rather than accidents.
 There are no legal barriers to female candidates for public
 office, although their numbers have remained small since
 independence. The late prime minister, Indira Gandhi, was a
 woman, and there are moderate numbers of women in both houses
 of Parliament.
 Government programs designed to improve the lot of the
 so-called "scheduled castes," which make up 15 percent of the
 population, have met only partial success. In some cases,
 upper-caste communities have mobilized against the upward
 mobility of the disadvantaged, with violence sometimes
 resulting. Political controversy surrounds the definition of
 those castes, tribes, and classes which should be granted
 preference in education, employment, and housing. This
 violence and controversy relates in part to perceived threats
 to the economic position of the higher-caste groups. In
 recent years, the central Government has increasingly
 attempted to strengthen the legal protection accorded to the
 underprivileged and often victimized groups. In several
 states, the system of reservations for disadvantaged castes is
 manipulated for political gain by party and community leaders.
 Minority religious groups continue to claim to be victims of
 discrimination. Sikhs traditionally have been fully integrated
 into Indian society and have been notably successful in
 agriculture and the professions, particularly the armed
 services. Terrorist violence, however, has increased tensions
 
 
 1154
 INDIA
 and distrust between Hindu and Sikh communities, leading to
 spontaneous outbreaks that have resulted in damage to
 property, injuries and deaths. The police forces have had
 difficulty containing some outbreaks but there is no evidence
 to support the charge of government involvement in this
 violence. The activities of Sikh militants in Punjab and
 elsewhere has led the Government to take measures to control
 the terrorism and, although they are treated equally under the
 law, Sikhs, particularly young males, continue to be subjected
 to more rigorous security precautions than others in certain
 circumstances (e.g. airport security).
 Muslims accused the Government earlier this year of interfering
 in Muslim personal law, which is protected by the Constitution.
 After attempting to change the divorce laws governing Muslims
 to conform to civil law, the Government withdrew its highly
 controversial proposal and maintained the community's right to
 follow Islamic tradition.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Although India is a leader in legislation protecting labor,
 certain categories of labor abuse remain common. Bonded
 labor, illegal since 1976, continues. Most commonly, bondage
 arises from debt incurred at usurious rates and continued
 through a lifetime of renewal of these debts. Bonded laborers
 are most commonly employed in agriculture and construction.
 Estimates of the number of bonded laborers range from 500,000
 to 2,500,000. The Government encourages states to take
 measures to detect, release, and rehabilitate bonded laborers
 and offers financial support for state programs.
 Forced labor has been defined by a Supreme Court decision as
 labor for remuneration at less than the minimum wage. Under
 this definition, forced labor is widespread throughout India,
 especially in rural areas. Minimum wages, however, are
 established by the states through wage advisory boards for
 "nonmodern" sectors such as agriculture. Minimum wages thus
 vary widely from state to state. Enforcement of even these
 low rates is poor. In many more modern industries, wage rates
 are set through collective bargaining of employers and trade
 unions reflecting supply and demand.
 Although illegal, child labor persists, a function of poverty
 and the lack of compulsory education. According to a survey
 of the Labor Department, 1 out of every 4 children between 5
 and 15 is employed.
 With the Factories Act of 1948, India established an 8-hour
 workday, a 48-hour workweek, and minimum standards for
 occupational safety and health. These standards are generally
 enforced and accepted in the modern industrial sectors but are
 less accepted in older, less cost-effective industries.
 Standards are generally not observed in small industries,
 largely because of the rapid growth in this sector and the
 small number of inspectors.
