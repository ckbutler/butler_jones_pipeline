 SAINT VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy and .a
 member of the Commonwealth of Nations. A prime minister, a cabinet and a uni-
 cameral legislative assembly compose the Government. A Governor General, ap-
 pointed by the British monarch, is the titular head of state, with largely cremonial
 powers. Prime Minister Sir James F. Mitchell and his New Democratic Part re-
 turned to power for an unprecedented third term in free and fair elections held in
 February 1994.
 The Royal St. Vincent Police, the only security force in the country, includes a
 coast ouard and a small Special Services Unit with some paramilitary training. The
 force is controlled by and responsive to the Government, but there continued to be
 occasional allegations of police brutality and the use of force and other extralegal
 means to elicit confessions from suspects.
 St. Vincent has a market-based economy. Much of the labor force is engaged in
 agriculture, in particular, banana production. Bananas are the leading export and
 the major source of foreign exchange earnings. The tourism sector is growmig. How-
 ever, unemployment remains high at over 30 percent, and per capita gross domestic
 product is low, at approximately $2,517.
 Human rights are generally well respected. The principal human rights problems
 continued to include occasional instances of excessive use of force by police, the
 Governments's failure to punish those involved in such abuse, inadequate and over-
 crowded prisons, and an overburdened court system.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punshment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment. However, a very high percentage of convictions (estimated
 at 90 percent by the regional human rights group, Caribbean Rights) continue to
 be based on confessions. A local human rights group claims that some of these con-
 fessions resulted from unwarranted police practices, including the use of physical
 force during detention, illegal search and seizure, and not properly informing those
 arrested of their rights. The Police Commissioner has dismissed or demoted officers
 involved in extralegal activity. The authorities charged one police officer with man-
 slaughter, his trial had not concluded by the end of the year.
 There is no independent review board to monitor police activity and to hear public
 complaints about police misconduct. Caribbean Rights has advocated such a board
 to protect the rights of citizens complaining of these activities.
 In a shocking case of police brutality, the local press reported that on April 8 two
 police officers allegedly burned McCarthy Patterson, a 12-year-old boy accused of
 stealing a radio, on the chest, thighs, back, and penis. The authorities dismissed the
 case against the two officers, however, after the child and his mother refused to tea-
 tifyj. Following an investigtion, the Polie Commissioner dismissed the two officers
 from the force, demoted another officer, and accepted the resignation of a fourth.
 In a March 22 letter to the editor, the president of the local human rights associa-
 tion called on the Poie Commissioner to investigate two o ther incidents of jpolice
 brutality. A plain clothes policeman allegedly pistol whipped Everard Knights in the
 face and struck him in the back as another officer held him. In addition, a police
 officer allegedly assaulted a 15-year-old boy.
 Inadeguate and overcrowded prisons remain a serious problem. These conditions
 are particularly harsh for juvenile offenders. There is a small facility for delinquent
 boys, but it is seriously inadequate and is generally used for those already convicted
 through the criminal system. Although separate legal statutes exist for youthful of-
 fenders, there are no separate magistrates or prosecutors to handle such cases.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides for persons de-
 tained for criminal offenses to receive a fair hearing within a reasonable time by
 an impartial court. Although there are only two official magistrates, the registrar
 of the High Court and the presiding judge of the family court now effectively serve
 as magistrates when called upon to do so. While this reduced the backlog, com-
 plaints remain regarding police practices in bringing cases to court. Some defense
 attoreys claim this has caused 6- to 12-menth delays in preliminary inquiries for
 serious crimes.
 There were no reports of instances of arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for public trials before
 an independent and impartial court. The court appoints attorneys for indigent de-
 fendants only when the defendant is charged with a capital offense. Defendants are
 presumed innocent until proven guilty and may appeal cases to a regional high
 court system and ultimately to the Privy Council in te United Kingdom. There are
 no separate security or military court systems. There were no reports of political
 prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary search and seizure or other government intrusions
 into the private life of individual citizens, and there were no reports of such abuses.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Seech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press. There are two major newspapers and numerous smaller, partisan
 publications; all are privately owned, and most are openly critical of the Govern-
 _ment's policies. There were no reports of government censorship or interference with
 the operation of the press.
 The lone television station in St. Vincent is privately owned and operates without
 government interference. Satellite dishes are popular among those who can afford
 em     ere is also a cable system with mainly North American programming that
 has approximately 300 subscribers. The Government controls programming for the
 government-owned radio station. There are no call-in talk shows; the Government
 canceled such a show in 1988, claiming it was politically slanted.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice.
 No formal government policy toward refugee or asylum requests exists. The issue
 of the provision of first asyum did not arise. There were no reports of forced expul-
 sion of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status; however, government practice
 remains undefined.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government through regularly scheduled
 free and fair elections. St. Vincent has a long history of multiparty parliamentary
 democracy. During the last elections in 1994, the two opposition parties united to
 challenge the ruling New Democratic Party. The effort was successful to the extent
 that the "Unity" coalition won 3 of 15 parliamentary seats-the NDP held all 15
 prior to the election. The opposition continues to charge that the ruling party has
 not complied with what the opposition asserts is a constitutional obligation to an-
 swer questions it puts forth.
 Two of the 15 members of Parliament are women. The same two women hold min-
 isterial portfolios in the current Government.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Opposition political groups and the Vincentian press often comment on human
 rights matters of local concern. The St. Vincent and Grenadines Human Rights As-
 sociation, affiliated with the regional Caribbean Human Rights Network, closely
 monitors government and police activities, especially with respect to treatment of
 prisoners, publicizing any cases of abuse. The Government is generally responsive
 to public and private inquiries about its human rights practices.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under the law regardless of race,
 sex, or religion, and the Government adheres to this provision.
 Women.-A local human rights group reports that violence against women (par-
 ticularly domestic violence) is a major problem. The Government has failed to take
 steps to determine the seriousness of the problem. To speed up the judicial handling
 of such cases, the Government established a family court under the Domestic Vio-
 lence Act of 1995.
 Depending on the magnitude of the offense and.the age of the victim, the penalty
 for rape is generally 10 or more years in prison. In May 1995, the legislature
 
 
 561
 amended the Child Support Law to allow for payments ordered by the courts even
 though notice of an appeal has been filed. Previously, fathers who had been ordered
 to pay child support could appeal decisions and not pay while the appeal was being
 head This resulted in a huge backlog of appeal cases and effectively reduced the
 number of mothers and children receiving support pa ents.
 The Ministry of Education, Youth, andVomen's Aairs has a women's desk which
 assists the National Council of Women with seminars, training programs, and pub-
 lic relations. The minimum wage law specifies that women should receive equal pay
 for eq"al work.
 Chldren.-The Social Welfare Office is the government agency responsible for
 monitoring and protecting the welfare of children. The police are the enforcement
 arm-the Social Welfare Office refers all reports of child abuse to the police for ac-
 tion. Marion House, a social services agency established by the Catholic Church in
 1989, provides counseling and therapy services.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no specific legislation covering those with dis-
 abilities. Most severely disabled people rarely leave their homes because of the poor
 road system and lack of affordable wheelchairs. The Government partially supports
 a school for the disabled which has two branches. A separate, small rehabilitation
 center treats about five persons daily.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association-The Constitution provides citizens the right to form
 unions, organize employees, and strike. There are no laws to complement this con-
 stitutional provision, however, and employers often ignore it by claiming it is their
 constitutional right not to recognize a trade union. Some employers, however, seek
 a good industrial relations environment, and cooperate with trade unions. There
 were no major strikes. Unions have the right to afliate with international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There are no legal obstacles
 to organizing unions; however, no law requires employers to recognize a particular
 union as an exclusive bargaining agent. Some companies offer packages of benefits
 with terms of employment-better than, or comparable to, what a union can normally
 obtain through negotiations. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employ-
 ers against union members and organizers. Generally effective mechanisms exist for
 resolving complaints. The authorities can order employers found guilty of antiunion
 discrimination for firing workers without cause (inciuding for participation in union
 activities) to reinstate the workers or give them severance pay.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.reForced or compulsory labor is ille-
 gal and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law sets the minimum work-
 ing age at 16 years of age, although a worker must be 18 years of ae to receive
 a national insurance card. The labor inspection office of the Ministry of abour mon-
 itors and enforces this provision, and employers generally respect it in practice. The
 age of leaving school at the primary level is 15 years; when these pupils leave school
 they are usually absorbed into the labor market disguised as apprentices. There is
 no known child labor except for children working on family-owned banana planta-
 tions, particularly during harvest time, or in family-owned cottage industries.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law sets minimum wages, which were last
 promulgated in 1989. They vary by sector and type of work and are specified for
 several skilled categories, including attendants, packers, cleaners, porters, watch-
 men and clerks. In agriculture the wage for workers provided shelter is $0.82
 (EC12.25) per hour, skilled industrial workers earn $7.36 (EC$20) per day, and un-
 skilled workers earn $3.68 (EC$10) per day. In many sectors the minimum wage
 is not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for workers and their families,
 but most workers earn more than the minimum. The Wages Council, according to
 law, should meet every 2 years to review the minimum wage. However there has
 been no meeting of the council for the last 7 years. There is no legislation concern-
 big the length of the workweek; however, the general practice is to work 40 hours
 in 5 days. The law provides workers a minimum annual vacation of 2 weeks.
 According to the Ministry of Labour, legislation concerning occupational safety
 and health is outdated. The most recent legislation, the Factories Act of 1955, has
 some regulations concerning ony factories, but enforcement of these regulations is
 ineffective. Workers enjoy a reasonably safe working environment; however, the
 trade unions have dealt with some violations relating to safety gear, long overtime
 hours, and the safety of machinery. There were some reports of significant visual
 deficiency by visual display unit workers, and some reports of hearing impairment
 by power station and stone crushing employees.
