 CUBA
 Cuba is a Communist state dominated by Fidel Castro, who is
 Chief of State, head of government, leader of the Communist
 Party, and Commander in-Chief of the armed forces. Supported
 by a few long-time associates, Castro controls all aspects of
 Cuban life through a network of directorates ultimately
 responsible to the Communist Party. The party is autonomous
 with self-perpetuating membership. Elections are only held to
 endorse party-approved candidates. In theory, the party
 determines the political, social, and economic norms of the
 country. In reality, basic policies are determined personally
 by Fidel Castro. Internal security and conformity are ensured
 by the Ministry of Interior, which operates border and police
 forces, orchestrates public demonstrations, decides on the
 legality of associations, investigates evidence of
 nonconformity, regulates migration, and maintains an intricate
 system of informers, block wardens, and block committees. The
 Constitution states that civil liberties may not be exercised
 "contrary to the decision of the Cuban people to build
 socialism and communism." Thus, such liberties may be
 exercised only to the degree that the State deems expedient.
 Although income distribution is more egalitarian than in
 prerevolutionary Cuba, the political and military elite live
 very comfortably, while the vast majority of Cubans must cope
 with severe scarcities of housing, food items, and consumer
 goods. Most necessities are still rationed--29 years after
 the Revolution--and sometimes are wholly unavailable. Many
 consumer items can be acquired, if at all, only at very high
 prices in the "parallel market." What private sector remains
 is too small to be economically significant. Inefficiency
 characterizes the state sector, where the incentive to produce
 is conspicuously absent. Cuban citizens are allowed to own
 personal property such as homes and automobiles, but cannot
 own any means of production in the national economy.
 As a result of international pressure and the 1987 session of
 the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) (where a
 motion to investigate Cuba's human rights record was thwarted
 by a procedural motion adopted by a margin of one vote), the
 Government launched an all-out campaign during the year to
 improve Cuba's human rights image. In February, Ricardo
 Bofill, president of the officially unrecognized Cuban Human
 Rights Committee (CHRC) was permitted to leave the French
 Embassy where he had been forced'to seek asylum during a
 government crackdown on the CHRC during August and September
 1986. Some members of the organization who had been arrested
 in 1986 were released, and the Government showed more
 tolerance for 'the existence of the CHRC, although still
 refusing to allow it to be registered as a legal entity. The
 Government also released a number of political prisoners,
 including several noted long-term "plantados" (political
 prisoners who refuse to accept political indoctrination),
 agreed to the processing of several hundred such persons for
 entry into tne United States as refugees, and opened a few of
 its prisons to limited inspection by foreign journalists and
 selected foreign visitors.
 Cuba refuses to allow visits by international human rights
 organizations and does not respond to their inquiries
 regarding human rights abuses and prison conditions. This
 refusal, plus the Government's total control of the flow of
 information, makes it difficult to obtain precise data,
 particularly statistics, about human rights abuses in Cuba.
 Political prisoners released in 1987 have reported that the
 
 
 442
 CUBA
 Government continues serious basic human rights abuses,
 including the use of torture, and many political prisoners
 continue to be confined in jail after the expiration of their
 original sentences. Other available evidence clearly reveals
 that widespread violations of basic human rights and
 fundamental freedoms continue in Cuba. A report on the human
 rights situation in Cuba prepared by the CHRC asserts that
 secret executions for both political and criminal offenses,
 secret trials, torture and other inhumane and degrading
 treatment of prisoners, arbitrary imprisonment, and murder and
 brutality by the police continued in Cuba in 1987. Arrests
 for political crimes persist; there is no independent
 judiciary; free speech is not permitted; all media are under
 government coordination and control; the practice of religion
 is actively discouraged, its teaching and propagation strictly
 limited, and even church publications on religious themes are
 not allowed.
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 In the early years of the Castro regime, summary execution of
 opponents was a frequent practice, and there are persistent
 reports that secret executions, preceded by trials devoid of
 due process, continue to be an instrument of policy. The
 officially unrecognized CHRC reports that execution for
 political crimes continues. Based on incomplete data, the
 CHRC has reported that at least 17 men were executed at
 Combinado del Este prison between July 1986 and June 1987
 after being charged with offenses against the security of the
 State.
 A later CHRC report cites 5 individuals by name who were tried
 in secret for political offenses without any semblance of due
 process or effective defense and executed in 1987. This CHRC
 report for 1987 states that many others were similarly
 executed. The CHRC also names 3 men--and asserts there were
 others--secretly executed for common crimes. In addition,
 according to the committee, 11 prisoners are currently
 awaiting execution including 5 for political offenses.
 Prisoners and detainees have died in custody under suspicious
 or unexplained clrcumstances. For example, according to his
 close associates, Dr. Aramis Taboada, lawyer, human rights
 proponent, and one-time associate of Fidel Castro, died while
 imprisoned in 1985. His death took place under such suspicious
 circumstances that strong doubt exists that it was a result of
 natural causes. The death certificate ultimately characterized
 Dr. Taboada's demise as a "sudden death."
 The CHRC reports that "by conservative calculation, based on
 lists prepared by the Political Presidium of Cuba, from
 January 1, 1959 until December 1987, some 36,000 persons,
 political opponents of the regime of Fidel Castro, have been
 executed by firing squad or murdered at the hands of the state
 security police and in the nation's prisons." The committee
 names six individuals who were murdered by the police in 1987
 and asserts that there were other such cases.
 b. Disappearance
 The CHRC has reported a number of cases of disappearances in
 1987. Persons detained for political offenses are often held
 
 
 443
 CUBA
 incommunicado for long periods, and their families are not
 informed of their whereabouts. There have been reports that
 the bodies of those who are executed or who die in police
 custody are sometimes not returned to the families for burial.
 The CHRC classifies all those executed for political crimes to
 be "missing" or "disappeared" since the "trials in which they
 are condemned to death are completely secret; no one has any
 word of them subsequent to their arrest;.and afterwards, the
 families of the victims never receive information regarding
 the remains of their loved ones.' Specific cases cited by the
 CHRC include that of three brothers, Ventura, Ciprian and
 Eugenio Garcia Marin, whose mother has been unable to obtain
 even minimal infokmation regarding the whereabouts of their
 remains. According to the CHRC, the mother of 15-year-old
 Owen Delgado Temprana, who was beaten to death by state
 security police, has been unable to recover the remains of her
 son. In addition, the CHRC report names 14 others who have
 similarly disappeared in 1987.
 An unknown number of persons have disappeared while attempting
 the perilous crossing to Florida in small boats or on homemade
 rafts and are presumed dead. While most of these deaths are
 likely due to the inherent dangers of the crossing, there have
 been unconfirmed charges that the Cuban Coast Guard and Air
 Force fire on boats and rafts trying to escape the island.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 While allegations of systematic torture within Cuba's prisons
 persist, independent verification remains impossible. Persons
 close to the late Dr. Aramis Taboada allege that he was
 systematically tortured by Cuban security-agents after his
 arrest in 1984. These sources state that Taboada was subjected
 to periods of confinement in a refrigerated cold-storage robm;
 was administered electrical shocks; hung by chains from the
 ceiling while he was beaten; and tied to a table and stuck
 with needles until he lost consciousness.
 Long-term political prisoners released in 1987 confirmed the
 inhuman conditions in Cuban jails. These former political
 prisoners describe such systematic forms of mistreatment as:
 beatings by prison officials; inadequate diet; denial of
 appropriate medical care; withholding of fresh air and
 exercise; denial of family visits and mail, sometimes for
 years; and extended periods of solitary confinement or
 incarceration in punishment cells. Cuba's treatment of
 political prisoners has repeatedly been denounced by the
 Inter-American Human Rights Commission, as well as by other
 international organizations, such as Amnesty International and
 Americas Watch.
 Among current political prisoners said to be suffering from
 improper nedical care are Carlos Cardo Hernandez and Jacinto
 Fernandez Gonzalez. Cardo, who is serving a 28-year sentence
 for rebellion, is said to have lost a lung as the result of
 improper medical treatment. Fernandez, serving 20 years for
 espionage, reportedly suffers from ulcerative colitis, cardiac
 eschemia, and other conditions. In October 1987, Fernandez
 and several other prisoners were reportedly placed in
 punishment cells in Combinado Prison for protesting the lack
 of medical care.
 
 
 444
 CUBA
 The CHRC continues to report numerous incidents of torture by
 the Government, both as punishment and as a means of extracting
 "confessions" from prisoners. The committee cites by name
 over fifty pri'soners who were tortured in 1987 and asserts
 that there is an unknown number of other such cases. Methods
 include placing prisoners in "drawers" in freezing cells and
 simulating executions.
 Former prisoners have reported that cold rooms or refrigerated
 cells are located in Villa Marista, Cuban State Security
 headquarters. Detainees are said to be placed in these cold
 rooms to make them more cooperative during interrogation. One
 former prisoner reported that it was nearly impossible to
 resist after a few hours of shivering in one of these cells.
 Political prisoners who refuse to accept political
 indoctrination or to wear the uniforms of common criminals are
 known as "plantados" and are subjected to particular abuse.
 They are allowed to dress only in pajamas or underwear or wear
 no clothing at all. Visits by friends or relatives are
 limited to one or two per year, or less, and letters to one
 per month.
 The Government is also alleged to have placed prisoners with
 no psychiatric problems in facilities for the criminally
 insane. Left unsupervised, they are often intimidated and
 abused by the other inmates. A psychiatrist stated that he
 was subjected to such treatment after his arrest in 1982.
 On October 29, the European Parliament passed a resolution
 which was highly critical of the Castro regime's detention and
 treatment of political prisoners. The resolution asserted
 that the Cuban Government holds "several hundred" political
 prisoners in prison, internment camps, labor camps, and
 psychiatric hospitals. The document cited a number of cases
 "among the most serious," naming 10 political prisoners, all
 of whom have served more than 20 years. The Parliament called
 for the UNHRC to draw up a comprehensive report on the
 situation in Cuba and urged the Cuban Government to release
 its political prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Arrests can be made by security forces acting secretly and
 without warrants. The Law of Penal Procedures requires the
 police to file formal charges and place the detainee at the
 disposition of the prosecutor within 96 hours of arrest.
 Otherwise, the detainee must be released. There were
 persistent reports, however, that detainees were held for long
 periods, frequently incommunicado, without judicial hearings,
 in direct violation of Cuban law. For example, these
 procedures were violated in the case of four members of the
 CHRC who were arrested in September 1986. They were detained
 for many months, but formal charges were never presented, nor
 were they brought before a prosecutor.
 The same law provides that a person held without charges
 beyond the period proscribed by law must be released upon
 petition to the court. This right was also violated in the
 case of four CHRC members. There are no known cases in which
 a detainee has successfully petitioned for release on this
 basis.
 
 
 445
 CUBA
 Under Article 61 of the Constitution, no legal protection can
 be invoked to prevent the State from arresting anyone it
 considers harmful to the "decision. of the Cuban people to
 *build socialism and communism." Criticism of the regime or
 the practice of an "unrecognized" religion, such as the
 Jehovah's Witnesses, can lead to arrest and imprisonment for
 counterrevolutionary activity. Antiregime graffiti or even a
 simple incautious remark can bring charges of "enemy
 propaganda." Such is the case of Jesus Barrios Loaces, who in
 1983 was sentenced to 4 years in prison for simply stating in
 public, "Viva Reagan."
 Andres Jose Solares-Teseiro, adopted by Amnesty International
 as a "prisoner of conscience," has been in prison since 1981
 when he was sentenced to 8 years' confinement, also on charges
 of "enemy propaganda." The conviction was based on his
 correspondence to sveral prominent figures abroad asking for
 their opinions on his idea of organizing a political party in
 opposition to the Cuban Communist Party. Amnesty International
 reports that all the documents seized by the Cuban authorities,
 which appeared to be the only evidence against him, were
 -ordered burned after the trial.
 There is no bail for defendants charged with crimes against
 state security or crimes for which the death penalty or the
 maximum prison sentence can beImposed.
 Political prisoners are not always released at the end of
 their terms. A case in point is that of Juan Martinez Otano.
 Martinez was sentenced to 10 years in 1972. He was released
 in 1987, after 15 years, with 8 montlhs off for good behavior,
 according to his release letter. There were no additional
 specified charges or any evidence of a new trial.
 Sometimes the release depends on a personal decision by Fidel
 Castro, who frequently has used the release of political
 prisoners to gain favor with influential foreign visitors or
 to put the latter under obligation to "respond" in some manner.
 Preventive detention is permitted and routinely practiced in
 cases of "dangerousness," a broad, arbitrary classification
 for persons deemed to have a proclivity for conduct contrary
 to "Socialist principles." Persons receiving this designation
 are subjected to repeated arbitrary arrest and indefinite
 detention, often punctuated by brutal interrogation*. Charges
 of "dangerousness" are often invoked against former political
 prisoners to ensure their complete cooperation and obedience
 to authorities.
 The CHRC reports that among other cases of persons arbitrarily
 arrested for "dangerousness" in 1987 were those of Dr. Raul
 Alfonso Morejon, a surgeon and former political prisoner,
 Grisel Elizonda Mendez, a dancer with the Tropicana cabaret
 troupe, and three Amor brothers. The three young sons of
 RamonAmor'were imprisoned for "dangerousness" apparently in
 reprisal for their father's attempts to be granted asylum in
 Switzerland.
 The Government commonly detains large numbers of persons
 before public celebrations and political events to ensure that
 there will be no threat to public order.
 In 1981 and again in 1983, the Government promised "amnesty"
 to a group of Cubans who had taken asylum in the Peruvian
 Embassy during the events that led to the Mariel boatlift in
 
 
 446
 CUBA
 1980. (Seeking asylum is a crime under Article 249 of the
 Penal Code.) Guarantees that the asylees would be allowed to
 depart Cuba were not honored, however. According to reports,
 of the 17 persons who accepted this "amnesty," two are serving
 prisons terms of 10 years, and none of the others have been
 permitted to leave the country. They are not allowed to work,
 nor are their children allowed to attend school. Three
 asylees still remain in the Peruvian Embassy after 7 years.
 In 1987 Cuba withdrew its offer of "guarantees" should they
 leave the Embassy, claiming that guarantees were never offered.
 In January Cuban authorities forcibly returned Pedro Pablo
 Sosa Ortega to Cuba after Ireland denied his request for
 asylum during a Cuban airliner's layover at Shannon airport.
 Mr. Sosa was reported to have been originally sentenced, after
 the February meeting of the UNHRC in Geneva, to 5 years'
 imprisonment for an attempt to flee Cuba. Mr. Sosa was again
 arrested in August while attempting to flee the island during
 a weekend furlough from prison. He is now believed'to be
 suffering from wounds inflicted by security personnel during
 or after that arrest, and is reportedly being held
 incommunicado at Combinado del Este prison in Havana.
 In May 1987, hundreds of persons were detained in an area of
 Havana near the French Embassy after Fidel Castro, in an
 interview with the French Communist newspaper l'Humanite, said
 that anyone who wished to leave Cuba could do so if the French
 Government would grant them visas.
 From the late 1960's until the early 1970's, the Government
 removed large numbers of families from the Escambray region of
 Villa Clara province, then a center of anti-Castro guerrilla
 activity, and forcefully relocated them to the town of Ciudad
 -Sandino in the extreme western end of the island in the
 province of Pinar del Rio. For years this was an exile city
 whose inhabitants were prohibited from leaving the immediate
 region without special permission from the political police.
 Although the percentage of exiles has diminished over the
 years as the normal population has increased, an unknown
 number of persons are reportedly confined to Ciudad Sandino in
 a state of permanent internal exile.
 While there are no reports of general use of forced labor in
 Cuba, students as young as 11 are required to spend from 6 to
 10 weeks a year performing agricultural work for which they
 receive no wages.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although Cuban courts are described constitutionally as
 "independent," in practice they are totally subordinate to the
 Communist Party through the National Assembly of the People's
 Power and the Council of State. All civil courts are presided
 over by a five-member panel of judges. Three are
 professionally qualified; the other two are "workers'
 representatives" who see that the "interests of the Revolution"
 are protected. People accused of certain counterrevolutionary
 activities are tried and sentenced secretly by military
 tribunals. There are no known incidents in which the courts
 have successfully ruled against the Government in any
 political or security matter.
 Under Cuba's version of "socialist legality," the right to a
 judicial determination of the legality of detention does not
 exist; there is no due process or right against self-
 
 
 447
 CUBA
 incrimination. Confessions are frequently obtained and used
 in cotrt, often as the only evidence against the defendant.
 Rules of evidence do not meet accepted international standards.
 Although defense lawyers are theoretically available to all
 defendants, attorneys have been jailed for defending persons
 charged with political offenses. One of those attorneys,
 Aramis Taboada, at noted above, died in a prison hospital in
 November 1985, under suspicious circumstances. At least two
 other attorneys, Domingo Jorge Delgado and Francisco Morua,
 have been jailed for their efforts on behalf of political
 defendants. Under these conditions, it is very difficult for
 a political defendant to retain legal counsel. Most must rely
 on public defenders. These government employees are generally
 ill-prepared and unsympathetic to the plight of their clients.
 Even when a lawyer, found independently by the defendant or
 his family, is willing to represent a defendant, he is
 frequently barred from doing so by judicial officials.
 There are no precise figures for the number of political-
 prisoners in Cuba nor of Cuba's prison population as a whole.
 In May 1987, Fidel Castro-told foreign journalists that there
 were no persons imprisoned in Cuba for their beliefs, although
 he said there were about 2,000 "saboteurs, counter-
 revolutionaries, ana foreign intelligence agents" behind
 bars. A Cuban Foreign Ministry spokesman later estimated that
 Cuba holds fewer than 800 such prisoners. Amnesty
 International reported that it knew of 450 political prisoners
 in Cuban jails at the end of 1986. Figures run as high as
 those of the CHRC, which estimates that there are over 15,500
 persons in jail for political crimes. -The great discrepancy
 in estimated totals is attributable in part to varying
 definitions of political offenses. The CHRC estimate includes
 persons jailed for their religious beliefs, convicted of trying
 to leave Cuba illegally, convicted of politically motivated
 common crimes, conscientious objectors, and persons held on
 charges of 'dangerousness." Given a totally controlled press
 and judiciary and the Government's refusal to allow
 comprehensive prison visits by objective international
 organizations, there is no way to verify such widely varying
 estimates. Whatever the actual number, it is clear that Cuba
 does have a sizable number of political prisoners and holds
 them for very long periods of time. The vast majority of them
 have been imprisoned for attempting to exercise such
 legitimate human rights as freedom of speech, religion,
 association, and assembly.
 Cuba still holds as many as 80 long-term political prisoners,
 known as "plantados" for their steadfast refusal to accept
 reeducation and indoctrination. Jailed since the early days
 of the regime, a number of these are now in their 29th year of
 imprisonment.
 In recent years, the Government has released small groups of
 political, prisoners for purposes of international opinion and
 its own political agenda. In 1986 Cuba released about 125
 long-term political prisoners, some on requests from the
 United States Catholic Conference and French oceanographer
 Jacques Cousteau. During 1987 the Government continued to
 release some political prisoners and allow their departure
 from Cuba. By the end of September 1987, 105 former political
 prisoners had traveled to the United States. Many former
 prisoners, Cuban human rights activists, and international
 observers see this as ai effort by Cuba to improve its human
 rights image, motivated by a nearly successful effort at the
 
 
 448
 CUBA
 1987 session of the UNHRC to call for investigation of human
 rights abuses in Cuba. The motion to call for an investigation
 was not put to a vote because of a procedural motion against
 its consideration which passed by the margin of only one vote.
 Discussions between the United States Catholic Conference and
 the Cuban Government in May 1987 led to an agreement to release
 as many as 350 present and former political prisoners for
 travel to the United States. The United States agreed to
 accept those that qualified under its refugee guidelines.
 Efforts to ensure entry into the United States by most of
 those approved, and their family members, by the end of 1987
 were hampered by Cuban government slowness in providing the
 documentation necessary to ensure that the persons are bona
 fide political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Daily life is closely monitored by the Committees for the
 Defense of the Revolution (CDR) that exist on virtually every
 block in Cuban municipalities, and in which membership is
 essentially mandatory. CDR members are expected to report
 anything "unusual," including strangers (especially foreigners)
 in the neighborhood, reception of foreign radio and television
 broadcasts, conspicuous consumption, unauthorized meetings, or
 critical comments about the Government.
 Few aspects of an ordinary Cuban's private life are free from
 state surveillance. Police searches of homes are carried out
 without warrants. Telephones are tapped, and mail is opened.
 Former political prisoners are especially subject to constant
 surveillance and official harassment. In particular, those
 who have applied to emigrate are routinely denied ration.
 cards, identification documents, and employment. Often denied
 the means of earning a living, they must rely on the generosity
 of family and friends or try to find work illegally outside
 the official economy. If they are allowed to work,.former
 political prisoners are almost always assigned menial tasks.
 The families of former political prisoners and of those who
 have applied to leave the country also suffer from the general
 societal fear of associating with those who have trouble with
 the authorities. Such persons are routinely denied higher
 education or specialized training with the explanation that
 such training will not serve the Revolution. Their school-
 aged children are frequently harassed by teachers and school
 officials.
 Family life is complicated by educational practices which
 often separate children from their parents and teach that the
 State's interests have priority over family ties. Further
 disruption is caused by strong pressures to participate in
 "voluntary" Communist Party-related activities. Parents fear
 that teaching their children religious practices, even in
 their homes, will harm the children's careers. There is a
 mandatory requirement for families to send all high school
 students, even as young as 11 years old, on annual 75-day
 stints of "voluntary work" at remote camps in distant rural
 areas. Conditions there are harsh and Spartan, with minimal
 food, long hours--as many as 16 a day, 6 days a week, plus a
 few hours on Sunday--of hard manual labor, military-like
 discipline, and family visits only on Sundays. The children
 reportedly are subjected to intensive Communist Party
 indoctrination during these periods.
 
 
 CUBA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is no freedom of speech or press in Cuba; the media are
 controlled by the State and are used for indoctrination and
 dissemination of propaganda. They publish or broadcast
 nothing that is not in consonance with the party line.
 Writers and artists are dependent upon government approval and
 support of their work. Nonpolitical poetry and fiction, as
 well as other works, are allowed only if they are devoid of
 social commentary objectionable to the Government.
 Likewise, academic freedom is nonexistent. All educational
 and regearch facilities and personnel are under strict control
 of the Government which enforces unwavering adherence to State-
 approved subject matter in every respect. Independent academic
 thought or practice at variance with the party line is not
 tolerated. There is a large audience for the Voice of
 America's Radio Marti, although the Cuban Government transmits
 an annoying buzz on the same medium wave frequency, and
 listening to Radio Marti is cause for suspicion. Non-Communist
 foreign periodicals are not permitted.-
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association are not provided for and,
 in practice, are actively discouraged. Any group meeting is
 almost certain to be monitored by the CDR or representatives
 of state security. All associations are controlled, and most
 are sponsored by the party or Government. A few private
 associations exist at the sufferance of the Government and at
 the personal risk of the members. The CHRC has been denied
 permission to register as a legal association. Dr. Domingo
 Jorge Delgado was arrested in late August 1986 after he tried
 to register the CHRC under the Law of Associations.
 Labor does not have the right to organize, bargain
 collectively, or strike. A well-established and active labor
 movement existing in 1958 was taken over by Communist cadres
 who took office even after having been defeated in democratic
 union elections. Most leaders of these unions, including
 those previously allied with Castro, were jailed. Cuban
 workers are required to belong to the officially sponsored
 Confederation of Cuban Workers (CTC). The CTC sends worker
 delegates to meetings of the International Labor Organization
 (ILO). The CTC is affiliated with the Communist-dominated
 World Federation of Trade Unions. It is not an independent
 trade union, but rather a mass organization under party
 control as established in the Cuban Constitution.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Church-state relations are administered by the Religious
 Affairs Office of the Central Committee of the Cuban Communist
 Party, established in 1985..' Despite outward signs of greater
 official religious tolerance, Cubans who practice their
 religion face serious discrimination and, occasionally, legal
 penalties. Religious groups must register with the Government
 and be "recognized." The Government has refused to register
 the Jehovah's Witnesses as a religious sect. Its buildings
 have been confiscated, and many adherents have been jailed for
 illegal religious activity.
 
 
 450
 CUBA
 The Government does not tolerate the beliefs of Seventh-Day
 Adventists who object to compulsory work and school attendance
 on Saturday. No exception to military service is made for
 conscientious objectors. Those who refuse to serve for
 religious reasons are jailed. There are reports that they
 have been incarcerated for much longer periods than others who
 fail to fulfill their military obligations.
 Although the Third Congress of the Cuban Communist Party in
 February 1986 softened party criticism of religions, openly
 religious Cubans are still excluded from all important
 positions in the Government and denied advancement in many
 fields. Discrimination can be found in the workplace where
 the open believer tends to be assigned the most menial jobs
 and in institutes of higher learning where believers are
 underrepresented in the student body and rarely found on the
 teaching staff. Castro has admitted that the regime
 discriminates against adherents of religious faiths.
 Long-term government and party policies to discourage
 religious observance have had a demonstrable effect. The
 majority of worshipers are over 50 years of age. Many
 churchgoers prefer to attend large downtown churches, hoping
 to remain anonymous rather than face their local Committees
 for the Defense of the Revolution which monitor attendance at
 the few neighborhood churches remaining ope-. Despite these
 difficulties, the Catholic Church reported in 1987 a small
 increase in both church attendance and baptisms.
 Four Protestant and two Catholic seminaries are allowed to
 operate, but religious elementary and secondary schools, as
 well as universities, are prohibited, as are church
 publications. The Catholic Church has not been permitted to
 circulate several thousand copies of the final conference
 report from its 1986 national conference. After a hiatus of
 more than 15 years, the Cuban Catholic Church was recently
 allowed to import 30,000 Bibles.
 Clergy and lay officials of Protestant as well as Catholic
 Churches are usually allowed to travel abroad on church
 matters. International contacts of all Cuban churches,
 however, are carefully monitored by the state security
 apparatus.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Domestic travel is not restricted by law, and Cubans are
 permitted to change their jobs and residences.
 Permission is required both to leave and to reenter the
 country. Nonofficial foreign travel is generally limited to
 rare cases of special humanitarian concern, such as illness in
 a family; other exceptions are clergy or lay officials on
 church business, women over 60, and men over 65. Even travel
 by these last two groups is severely limited. When permission
 to trav4l is granted, a person may remain abroad only for the
 limited time specified in the exit permit.
 Emigration is strictly controlled, and those who apply to
 leave may lose their jobs, houses, and ration books.
 Moreover, their children may be refused further schooling. In
 some cases, the intending emigrants are physically and verbally
 abused. Draft-age males and professionals have reported that
 the Government will allow them to emigrate only if they pay
 
 
 451
 CUBA
 tens of thousands of dollars, ostensibly to reimburse the
 Government for the cost of their education. The few people
 permitted to emigrate must leave behind almost all their
 personal and household possessions. Their houses generally
 become the property of the State. Those emigrating were
 required to pay discriminatory airfares that were double the
 established rate. These payments had to be made in hard
 currency obtained from relatives abroad and deposited with the
 National Bank of Cuba.
 There is no freedom to return to Cuba once a Cuban has taken
 up residence abroad. Those who wish to return either
 temporarily or permanently must obtain a permanent departure
 passport and a Cuban visa.
 When permission to emigrate is denied, the Government gives no
 reason.' Notification of denial is by an official form which
 simply states that the request "... cannot be approved since
 it is not provided for by the established emigration
 procedures."
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Cuban citizens are not free to change their government. Cuba
 is firmly controlled by the Communist Party, which in turn is
 dominated by Fidel Castro. Members of the Central Committee
 and the Politburo are selected by a narrow circle of party.
 rulers. Elections simply ratify choices already made. The
 National Assembly of People's Power meets briefly twice a
 year, solely to endorse decisions already made by the party.
 No political opposition is permitted in Cuba. With the
 current exception of some Cuban Human Rights Committee
 members, dissidents are in jail, outside the country, or
 forced to remain silent.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government denies that there are violations of human
 rights in the country, but refuses permission for any
 organizations to investigate claims of abuses. The ICRC has
 not been given access to Cuban jails or allowed to visit
 political prisoners. America's Watch, Amnesty International,-
 and similar organizations have also been refused access. Nor
 does the Government honor requests for information on political
 prisoners or prison conditions. A representative of the
 Council on Hemispheric Affairs was to visit Havana in November
 1986, but his visa was abruptly withdrawn when the Cuban
 Government learned that one of his purposes was to discuss
 human rights.
 In October 1987, Fidel Castxo told a group of visitors from
 the United States that he would never permit any'human rights
 organizatibn to visit Cuba. He did indicate, however, that
 individual members of these organizations might be permitted
 as part of delegations visiting Cuba on other matters. In
 fact, a representative of America's Watch was included in a
 delegation sponsored by the American Bar Association that
 visited Cuba in August 1987. The delegation was taken to
 Combinado del Este prison and two women's prisons in the
 Havana area, although they were not allowed to see the maximum
 security areas or the areas for political prisoners.
 Similarly, other groups have been allowed tightly controlled

 CUBA
 visits to a small number of prisons. These visits have all
 been carefully orchestrated to present only the positive
 aspects of the penal system.
 The Government does not recognize the small, unofficial Cuban
 Human Rights Committee (CHRC) and has refused to allow it to
 register as a legal association. Its members have been
 repeatedly arrested, imprisoned, and subjected to constant
 surveillance and harassment when they have been released. In
 1980, CHRC president Ricardo Bofill was arrested and sentenced
 to 8 years in prison for "enemy propaganda." As a result of
 international pressure on his behalf, he was released in
 1982. In 1983 Bofill took refuge in the French Embassy in
 Havana, leaving the Embassy after the Cuban Government gave
 assurances that he would not be arrested. In September 1983,
 he was rearrested after speaking to two French journalists and
 imprisoned. Following his release from prison in August 1985,
 Bofill was kept under close police scrutiny.
 In August 1986, fearing that he was about to be arrested and
 returned to prison, Bofill again took refuge in the French
 Embassy. Also in August, CHRC member Jose Luis Alvarado was
 reportedly rearrested, having been released just the previous
 May. CHRC member, Dr. Jorge Delgado, was also arrested in
 August 1986 after attempting to register the CHRC as a legal
 association. In September, 3 members of the CHRC, the only
 members other than Bofill who were not imprisoned at the time,
 were arrested shortly after the Agence France Press and the
 Reuters correspondents filed reports of their interview with a
 member of the CHRC. The two reporters were detained and
 summarily expelled.
 The arrested members of the CHRC were detained for many months
 without charges at State'Security headquarters, where they
 were subjected to brutal and coercive interrogation. One of
 them went on a hunger strike and was taken to a military
 hospital. A number of international human rights
 organizations and concerned individuals urged Castro to end
 government persecution of Bofill and to release the jailed
 CHRC members. In February 1987, the French Government
 received assurances that Bofill would not be arrested and
 would be allowed to return to his home unmolested. Bofill
 left the Embassy after a stay of 5 months. Three members of
 the CHRC arrested in September 1986 were also released from
 detention. These events took place just before the UNHRC
 convened in Geneva, with Cuban human rights abuses on its
 agenda. Elizardo Sanchez,-the executive secretary of the
 CHRC, was not released until May 1987.
 Since the release of Sanchez in May 1987, the Government has
 been more tolerant of the CHRC and has allowed it to operate
 more openly. In July 1987, Bofill and other members gave
 interviews to visiting U.S. reporters, who had received
 approval in advance from the Cuban Foreign Ministry. Bofill
 and other CHRC members have since met with other foreign
 visitors, seemingly without official interference. Many
 observers believe that this new tolerance of the CHRC is a
 government tactic to improve its human rights image before the
 next round of UNHRC meetings in early 1988.
 It must be noted that the CHRC remains a small association
 whose activities are extremely circumscribed and totally
 unpublished within Cuba. The CHRC has no means to disseminate
 its reports beyond word of mouth via a small group of

 sympathizers, through foreign radio reports such as those
 carried on Radio Marti, and its own limited contacts with the
 international press.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status-
 Although discrimination against women and minorities is
 outlawed, few women have held high positions in the
 government. There have been some changes in this regard in
 the last 2 years. Women now make up -18-percent of the full
 and alternate members of the Central Committee of the
 Communist Party.
 Blacks and other minorities are underrepresented in the top
 levels bf government. The Government claims that blacks and
 persons of mixed-race now account for 28 percent of the
 membership of the Party's Central Committee. There is one
 black among the 14 full members of the Politburo and one among
 the 1-0 alternate members.
 CONDITIONS OF IUABOR
 The standard workweek is 44 hours, which includes 8 hours
 .every other Saturday.- Provisions for -worker safety and
 control of industrial pollution-are inadequate. The minimum
 wage-is about $150 per month at the official rate of exchange
 which substantially overvalues the Cuban peso. Housing and
 rationed foods are inexpensive though chronic shortages of
 both persist. Medical care and education are free. Workers
 receive 1 month of anhual'vacation. Cubans do not normally
 begin working before the age of 17, although under some
 controlled circumstances they may begin at 14. Minors under
 age 17 are not permitted to work under hazardous conditions or
 for more than 7 hours a day or 40 hours a week. However,
 students, even as young as 11, are required to spend from 6 to
 10, weeks a year performing agricultural work, such as
 harvesting crops.
 Throughout 1987 Fidel Castro and other senior officials
 continued to criticize both management and labor in Cuba for
 lack of enthusiasm and discipline, resulting, in their view,
 in poor economic performance. Criticism of work standards and
 threats of severe punishment accompanied these denunciations
 which were termed the "Rectification of Errors" campaign.
 Cubans are pressured to "volunteer" to work periodically on
 specially designated Sundays; known as "-Red Sundays", and to
 participate in labor brigades, which Castro has described as
 morally superior to material incentives as a means for dealing
 with Cuba'-s economic crisis. .
