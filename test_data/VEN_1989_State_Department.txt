 VENEZUELA
 Venezuela is a republic with an active multiparty democratic
 system, a free press, strong unions, and a longstanding
 commitment to democracy. For more than 30 years, power has
 passed peacefully between the two major political parties
 through open elections. In 1988 a third Venezuelan party
 emerged as a significant factor.
 The Venezuelan security apparatus has civilian and military
 elements, both of which are held accountable to popularly
 elected authorities. The military services still focus on
 conventional war, but are occasionally called upon to maintain
 domestic order, for example, during the urban rioting which
 erupted early in 1989.
 Venezuela's mixed economy is dominated by the public sector.
 The state-owned petroleum industry currently accounts for some
 20 percent of the gross domestic product, more than any other
 industry. The Venezuelan Government is in the process of a
 major economic restructuring to reduce its dependence on oil
 exports and to enable domestic business to compete more
 effectively in the international market. To reduce the scope
 of public sector intervention in the economy, authorities have
 rationalized the exchange rate, reduced interest rate and
 price controls, as well as the level of subsidies for consumer
 goods. In the short term the adjustment program is likely to
 be painful.
 The principal human rights concerns in Venezuela result from
 weaknesses, including alleged corruption, in the country's
 judicial system, which often result in prolonged pretrial
 imprisonment, and in the law enforcement system, which
 continues to be charged with numerous instances of arbitrary
 detention, of abuse of detainees, and of extrajudicial
 killings. The 1989 human rights record was marred by
 widespread riots and the reactions of security forces. On
 February 27-28, crowds, reacting to a sharp increase in bus
 fares, began burning buses. The violence grew when mobs,
 frustrated by reduced food supplies, began widespread looting
 of groceries and other businesses. With police unable to
 restore order or to safeguard property, the Government
 temporarily suspended some constitutional rights and used
 military force to restore order and to feed the population.
 While most Venezuelans were relieved at the army's success in
 restoring order, many persons were killed, and critics
 characterized some of the army's tactics as heavy-handed and
 unjustified.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Authorities do not engage in or condone unlawful or arbitrary
 killing for political motives, and there were no reports of
 such killings. There have, however, been instances of
 extrajudicial killings, including police shooting and killing
 of criminal suspects, of security forces killing civilians,
 and of arrested persons dying while in police custody.
 In the only incident of its kind to occur under democratic
 rule in Venezuela, a large number of extrajudicial killings
 took place in February, when the Government, in response to
 
 
 widespread rioting and looting, declared a curfew and
 instructed regular military forces to restore order in
 numerous neighborhoods in Caracas and other cities. Critics
 of the Government charged that security forces shot at random
 into houses and businesses, killing people both in their homes
 and on the street who were breaking no laws and represented no
 threat. The Minister of Defense denied that an order to
 "shoot on sight" was issued and said that his forces only
 responded to attacks against them. Critics acknowledge that
 snipers challenged the military in some areas (although the
 prevalence of such activity is in dispute), and the Government
 admits that in some instances excess force might have been
 used. The Government called on the army when the efforts of
 police to control mob violence broke down. (In a few
 instances, police officers actually joined the looting during
 the first 2 days, before the armed forces intervened.) The
 rioting spread not only through most of the capital but also
 to smaller towns and cities throughout the country. It was
 primarily in Caracas, however, that casualties occurred.
 Violence subsided in most other urban areas before deadly
 force was employed.
 The Government estimated that there were from 275 to 300
 deaths resulting from the riots. Other estimates were much
 higher, and some government officials agreed that the official
 figures were too low. A few sources, citing reports from
 family members and personal contacts in hospitals and morgues,
 contended that the death toll exceeded 1,000. The exact
 number of deaths could not be established, nor could the
 proportion of deaths caused by security forces versus those
 caused, accidentally or deliberately, by mob actions.
 President Carlos Andres Perez appointed a special committee to
 investigate military actions during the riots, which found
 that some abuses had occurred. An arrest warrant was issued
 for two municipal police officers accused of abuse of
 authority for entering a private residence and removing,
 beating, and shooting at two persons with whom they had
 personal differences. Some critics complained that the
 Government's attempts to redress grievances arising from these
 incidents were inadequate. The G'overnment maintained that,
 while unfortunate abuses did occur during February, many were
 unavoidable given the extent of the disturbances.
 In another case of extrajudicial killing, the shooting to
 death of 14 civilians by Venezuelan security forces in the
 town of El Amparo, near the Colombian border, during October
 1988, was considered by both military courts and the Supreme
 Court during 1989. Arrest warrants issued against some of the
 officers involved in the shootings, based on the testimony of
 two survivors, were revoked by the military court of appeals
 on the grounds that the issuing court did not have
 jurisdiction. Fearing for their safety, the two survivors
 were given temporary refuge by the Catholic Church. The court
 decision was sharply criticized as obstructing a full inquiry
 into what generally is regarded as having been a massacre. In
 a further appeal, the Supreme Court refused jurisdiction. On
 December 5, however, a separate section of the Supreme Court
 reviewed and annulled the earlier decision by the military
 court. This second decision declared that the military court
 does, in fact, have jurisdiction and should issue a new
 decision based on "accurate" legal interpretations. At year's
 end, it remained unclear what effect this ruling will have on
 the El Amparo case.

 VENEZUELA
 b. Disappearance
 In the February-March violence, when civil liberties were
 temporarily suspended by the Government using martial law
 authority, numerous persons disappeared for varying lengths of
 time. Some of these persons were later found dead, reportedly
 having been shot in the head or back. Persons claiming to
 have been eyewitnesses told of individuals taken from their
 homes by security officials; some were later found in prisons
 or other detention centers, and others were reportedly later
 found dead. The.Committee for the Disappeared, a group
 composed 9f family members of the missing people, lists 16
 persons as still being untraceable. Other human rights
 groups, not necessarily made up of missing persons, families,
 offer Eigures in this same range. Human rights groups
 reported that the Public Prosecutor's office has increased
 efforts to assist the families of the missing.
 c. Torture and OtheX Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by law. Constitutional provisions for
 the integrity of the individual are-generally enforced, but
 allegations of physical abuse of detainees are prevalent.
 There are-claims that electric shocks and beatings are not
 uncommon during ordinary times--some detainees have publicly
 told of such experiences--and that more extreme abuses
 occurred during the February riots.
 In an August conference on Venezuelan prison conditions,
 Justice Minister Guerra, who has been a strong proponent of
 judicial and penal reform, noted that the prison system was in
 need of "urgent" and "total reform." The nation's prisoners
 live in "subhuman conditions," according to the Minister. He
 was joined by Chief Public Prosecutor Escovar Salom in
 recognizing that prison conditions are exacerbated by serious
 overcrowding--28,643 prisoners are kept in institutions
 designed to hold 9,000. Sanitation and health care in prisons
 are inadequate, as is the diet unless supplemented by
 donations from friends and family. Discipline within prisons
 is widelyconsidered to be inadequate, and violence by guards
 against the prisoners, and among the prisoners themselves, is
 said to be common. Official personnel involved in such
 violence are not known to be punished. Some sources argue
 that conditions in preliminary detention centers, not set up
 for extended incarcerations, are even worse, as they are often
 pressed into service as de facto prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The right to judicial determination of the legality of
 detention is provided for by law. Arrested persons or persons
 under preventive detention legally can be held for up to 8
 days without a formal detention order, during which time they
 may be held incommunicado. Arbitrary arrests and arrests with
 improper ;rarrants are common, and the time limits for holding
 persons are frequently exceeded, usually because of
 inefficiencies in the legal system. A law increasing the
 power of judges to redress abuses by ordering the release of
 someone unjustly imprisoned aids in enforcing the 8-day limit
 within which an arrestee must be formally charged or set
 free. Even if a person is detained.under a proper order, the
 time of detention pending trial often exceeds the amount of
 time the person would have been required to serve had he been
 found guilty. For several days following the start of the
 
 
 '763
 VENEZUELA
 February riots, the Government used martial law authority to
 suspend the constitutional right which protects citizens from
 detention without charge.
 Bail is permitted only for relatively minor crimes.
 Venezuela's bail laws have been under review by the Congress,
 and the Government hopes to increase the applicability of bail
 provisions, a step which would contribute to relieving
 overcrowded prisons. Bail is not available in cases involving
 allegations of government malfeaseance.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair trial is provided by law, and there exist
 a number of procedural safeguards. However, once formally
 charged, the burden of proof is on the accused to prove his or
 her innocence, and lengthy pretrial detention is the norm.
 The law provides public defenders for those unable to afford
 competent defense; however, the number of public defenders in
 the country (350) is insufficient to meet this obligation. In
 some cases, defendants who remain outside the country pending
 assignment of a court date (to avoid extended pretrial
 detention without bail) may not select their own attorneys;
 the court appoints an attorney in these cases.
 According to the Ministry of Justice, fewer than 25 percent of
 all prisoners have been convicted. Judicial authorities
 attribute the backlog to an insufficient number of qualified
 judges, automatic review of all lower court decisions by
 higher courts unable to limit their dockets, and failure to
 enforce procedural deadlines at each stage of the legal
 process. Delays of 2 or 3 years in a normal case are not
 infrequent. The judicial process is almost exclusively a
 written one, requiring costly and time-consuming production of
 voluminous reports by judges, attorneys, and witnesses at
 every stage.
 Some Venezuelan leaders and legal experts also attribute
 delays and other irregularities to corruption and the use of
 personal influence. The civilian judiciary is legally
 independent, but connections to the two major political
 parties are important in the judicial selection process. In
 September, the Public Prosecutor charged political parties
 with "interfering abusively in (public) institutions, even
 impeding the autonomy of the judiciary." To help prevent such
 political meddling, there is a five-member Judicial Council
 which is responsible for the nomination, training, and
 discipline of judges. One member is selected by Congress, one
 by the President, and three by the Supreme Court. A law
 passed in October 1988 reduced the membership of the Judicial
 Council to five from nine in an attempt to reduce political
 party influence on the selection process.
 Civilians charged with armed subversion are tried by military
 courts as insurgents. There is no statutory time limit on the
 adjudication of cases in military courts, although persons
 convicted under the military justice system have the same
 right to appeal to the Supreme Court as those prosecuted under
 the civilian system. Military judges are appointed by the
 Supreme Court. There has been criticism of the preponderant
 referral to military courts (230 to 240 out of approximately
 280 cases) of the legal cases brought against security agents
 for. alleged abuses during the February riots. Besides the
 
 
 764
 VENEZUELA
 lack of deadlines in the military system, critics contend that
 the system's secrecy and tendency to close ranks make it
 unlikely that the defendants would undergo an impartial,
 complete prosecution.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution and law provide safeguards against arbitrary
 interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence.
 These safeguards are largely honored in practice, although
 there is evidence that some wiretapping takes place. Most of
 the charges of invasion of privacy connected with a 1989
 wiretap scandal came from politicians accusing opposing
 parties of spying and eavesdropping. A Supreme Court Justice
 was quoted by the press in June as saying the "violation of
 privacy has created a syndrome of national anxiety." He
 stated that he would undertake a study of Venezuelan law to
 ensure it incorporated sufficient safeguards against
 wiretapping. The proscription against government agents
 entering houses without a warrant was briefly suspended in the
 wake of the February riots.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of the press and free
 speech. These liberties, along with academic freedom, are
 almost universally honored, although the previous Government
 on one occasion restricted newsprint to a journal deemed to be
 "too free" in its investigations.
 Venezuela has a free and lively press, which frequently
 criticizes the Government and denounces instances of
 government interference in the media. From February 28
 through March 22, the Government rescinded a number of
 constitutional guarantees, including freedom of speech and of
 the press, because the media were allegedly reporting the
 disturbances in an inflammatory manner. While human rights
 sources report their press pontacts exercised greater
 self-censorship after the guarantees were restored,
 journalists themselves say press freedom has generally
 increased under the new presidential administration. The
 media followed vigorously and with no apparent restraint the
 development of various government corruption cases, including
 the deliberations of the ruling party ethics tribunal which
 expelled and disciplined some leading party members during the
 latter part of the year.
 Venezuela has 4 nationwide television networks, 2 of which are
 government owned, 3 regional television stations, 168 radio
 stations, and numerous newspapers and magazines, with 9
 dailies in Caracas alone. The Government is a significant
 source of qdveftising revenue for the media, but there appear
 to be no recent instances where government advertising was
 channeled for political ends.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is normally
 respected in Venezuela, although it, along with several other
 constitutional guarantees, was suspended from February 28
 through March 22, when a nighttime curfew was also enforced.
 Public meetings, including those of all political parties, are
 
 
 765
 VENEZUELA
 held without interference. Permits are required for public
 marches but are not denied for political reasons.
 Professional and academic associations operate without
 interference. Most have ties to political parties.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The population is predominantly Roman Catholic, although other
 religious groups enjoy freedom of worship and proselytize
 actively. Foreign missionaries, both Catholic and Protestant,
 are active throughout the country.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens and legal residents generally have freedom to travel
 within the country and to go abroad and return. Travel in the
 Amazon military zone is an exception and requires a special
 permit for security reasons. Venezuelans may emigrate if
 their tax obligations have been met. Citizenship can be
 renounced. Recovery of nationality requires a residence
 period of 2 years for Venezuelan-born repatriates. The
 Constitution provides for revocation of citizenship for
 naturalized citizens on specific, limited legal grounds.
 Venezuela traditionally has been a haven for refugees, exiles,
 and displaced persons from many European, Caribbean, and Latin
 American countries. Refugees are given normal residence
 status and may be expelled only for criminal activities.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Government is freely elected by secret ballot. Venezuela
 is a multiparty democracy, with mandatory suffrage for all
 those 18 years of age or older, and the political process is
 open to all. Elections for the President, Congress, and state
 legislative assemblies are held every 5 years. Over two dozen
 parties participated in the 1988 national presidential
 elections. Eleven parties are represented in the House of
 Deputies and 4 parties are represented in the Senate.
 In December governors in 20 states and mayors in 269
 municipalities were elected for the first time in Venezuelan
 history. This election was also the first to use a system
 allowing the voter to choose individual candidates by name,
 rather than selecting only among party slates. Critics
 contend that the method developed for counting the votes,
 which guarantees minority party participation, is unfair and
 denies citizens truly direct representation.
 Political views are freely expressed, and persons from the
 entire political spectrum contend for positions ranging from
 municipal council seats to the presidency. Minor parties won
 18 percent of the seats in the national legislature in 1988;
 some of these parties are outgrowths of former guerrilla
 organizations. The two largest parties are the centrist
 social democratic and social Christian parties. The Movement
 Towards Socialism party, founded by disenchanted'members of
 the Venezuelan Communist Party, increased its share of the
 total vote to 10 percent in the congressional elections of
 1988, Even some of the smaller parties provide mechanisms by
 
 
 766
 VENEZUELA
 which minority elements within their membership are guaranteed
 a voice in administrative and policymaking decisions to
 preclude their disenfranchisement.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Latin American Foundation for Human Rights and Social
 Development and the Federation of Families of Disappeared
 Persons have offices in Caracas, and human rights
 organizations are able to operate free of government
 restriction. Both Amnesty International and Americas Watch
 delegations visited in 1989 to investigate the February riots
 and the 1988 massacre at El Amparo.
 The number of local human rights groups proliferated
 noticeably after February. Human rights groups do not suffer
 from government persecution and vigorously criticize perceived
 government inadequacies in-redressing'grievances.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no evidence that economic and Social needs and
 cultural aspirations are denied on a discriminatory basis to
 any portion of the population. The Constitution prohibits
 discrimination on the basis of sex and accords women and
 children "special protection" in the workplace. Women workers
 receive extensive maternity leave benefits, and laws limit
 their involuntary overtime.
 The Venezuelan Government recognizes that violence against
 women, including domestic violence such as wife beating, is a
 problem. Due to inadequate statistical data, the true extent
 of such abuse is impossible to gauge. Victims frequently are
 reluctant to report cases or to press charges. The Ministry
 of the Family operates shelters for beaten women. In an
 effort to educate women about their rights, the Government
 distributes pamphlets, especially in poor neighborhoods, to
 alert residents to the illegal nature of domestic violence and
 their legal remedies. While Venezuelan authorities are
 sensitive to the problem, the ineffectiveness of Venezuelan
 justice offers little prospect of quick relief.
 Restrictions on property rights based on sex, religion, or
 social status do not exist, but there are some restrictions on
 ownership of business property and employment based on
 nationality. For example, there is a wage/salary and
 headcount rule in the labor law which requires that 75 percent
 of all wages and salaries and 75 percent of the payroll
 employees be Venezuelan nationals. The Superintendency of
 Foreign Investment has interpreted foreign investment
 legislation to mean that "mixed" and "national" Venezuelan
 companies phould have Venezuelan nationals as president.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Both constitutional and labor law recognize and encourage
 unions' right to exist. There are no restrictions on this
 right in practice in either the public or private sectors
 (except for the armed forces). The Government's positive
 attitude toward unions reflects the prevailing political
 
 
 climate. Unions play a major role in the Venezuelan economy.
 One major union confederation (the Venezuelan Confederation of
 Workers--CTV) and three small ones, as well as a number of
 independent unions, operate freely in Venezuela. About 25
 percent of the national labor force is unionized, and the
 figure is about 44 percent in the urban formal sector. There
 are no restrictions on affiliation with international labor
 organizations; the CTV is an active participant in the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). In
 1989 it hosted a congress of the ICFTU's regional organization
 for Latin America.
 The CTV's top leadership includes members of several political
 parties. The majority are affiliated with the country's
 largest party, Accion Democratica (AD) (the social democratic
 party), and AD and the CTV reciprocally influence each other.
 The CTV, however, has repeatedly demonstrated its independence
 from both the Government (in which AD holds the presidency and
 a plurality of the seats in Congress) and the parties. The
 clearest example of this independence is the CTV's frequent
 criticism of the Government's economic policies, culminating
 in the general strike of May 18.
 The right of public and private sector employees to strike is
 recognized legblly and upheld in practice. In recent years
 Venezuelan workers seldom resorted to use of the strike, but
 the decline in living standards during the year, as the
 Government introduced austerity measures, increased the
 popularity of this tactic. In 1989 the Government resorted to
 mandatory arbitration in the case of a strike by doctors
 against the Social Security Administration. The arbitration
 board awarded doctors a considerable increase over the
 previous contract, but less than they believed they had been
 promised. The award provoked considerable controversy among
 doctors, but most returned to work.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The labor law specifically states that workers will be free
 from all "interferences, prohibitions, subordinations, and
 coercions" in the exercise of their rights to organize unions
 and elect officials. The same legislation states that it is
 the duty of unions to represent their members in negotiations
 for a collective contract, and it also protects employees who
 engage in union activities from reprisals by employers.
 Venezuelan law encourages collective bargaining, which is
 widely practiced. At the end of 1988, 39 percent of public
 and private sector employees were covered by collective
 contracts, including 36 percent in manufacturing, 61 percent
 in construction, 18 percent in commerce, and 42 percent in
 transportation.
 Workers' legal rights are not restricted in free trade zones.
 Labor law is enforced by Ministry of Labor inspectors,
 tripartite (labor-management-government) commissions (which
 hear complaints regarding firings), and labor courts.
 Although parts of this system are overburdened and slow,
 overall it is regarded as effective in protecting workers'
 rights. In its 1989 report, the International Labor
 Organization's Committee of Experts repeated its earlier
 request to the Government to increase the severity of
 sanctions under the law for antiunion discrimination.
 
 
 768
 VENEZUELA
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in Venezuela;
 unremunerated labor is prohibited'by law.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Venezuelan law prohibits the following: the employment of
 children under age 14; a workday of more than 6 hours for 14-
 and 15-year olds; and night work or employment at hazardous
 tasks for those under.age 18. This legislation is enforced in
 the formal sector of the economy but much less so in the
 informal sector. Worsening economic conditions are probably
 pushing more workers into the informal sector, including
 children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The minimum wage for new hires in the urban sector in
 September 1989 was about $105 monthly, plus mandatory fringe
 benefits that vary with the workers' individual circumstances,
 but in general would increase wages by about one-third.
 Because of an across-the-board wage increase given to the
 urban private sector in March, the effective minimum wage for
 anyone hired before that time is about $121 monthly plus
 benefits. The agricultural minimum wage is lower,
 approximately $68 monthly. -While wages iicreased
 significantly in 1989, a high rate of inflation, especially in
 basic items such as food and transportation, offset these
 gains. There is a consensus that workers' standards of living
 dropped faster in 1989 because subsidies were reduced as the
 Government's oil revenues fell.
 By law, the workweek for blue-collar workers may not exceed 48
 hours plus 2 hours' daily overtime or a maximum of 200 hours
 overtime per year. The maximum legal workweek for
 white-collar workers ig-44_hours. Some unions, such as the
 petroleum workers, have negkbiated a 40-hour week. Employees
 must be given a rest period of at least a half-hour after 5
 hours of work. The law is generally observed with the
 exception of restrictions on overtime. 'Paid holidays and
 weekly rest days are also provided by law.
 A health and safety law was passed in 1986, but its
 enforcement awaits the development of standards and issuance
 of implementing regulations. Opinions regarding the potential
 effectiveness of this law vary. Some businessmen regard the
 penal sanctions of this law for cases of negligence resulting
 in injury as too harsh, and some labor leaders believe that
 efforts to improve working conditions are proceeding too
 slowly. The Ministry of Labor prepared for the establishment
 of an Office of Occupational Health and Safety which is
 scheduled to open in 1990.
