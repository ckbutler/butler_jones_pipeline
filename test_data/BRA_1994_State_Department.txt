 BRAZIL
 Brazil is a constitutional federal republic comprising 26 states and the federal dis-
 trict. In 1994 voters elected a new President, two-thirds of the Senate, 513 federal
 deputies, 27 governors, and members of state legislatures. It was the second time
 since the end of military rule that Brazilians freely chose their President and re-
 newed the legislative bodies in accordance with the 1988 Constitution. Fernando
 Henrique Cardoso became President on January 1, 1995, and will serve a 4-year
 term, reduced from 5 years by a 1994 constitutional amendment.
 Security forces in Brazil fall primarily under the control of the states. State police
 are divided into two forces: the civil police with an investigative role, and the uni-
 formed, "military" police, who are responsible for maintaining public order. Accord-
 ing to the Constitution, the states' military police must serve as army reserves; they
 maintain some vestiges of military privileges, including special judicial systems.
 Brazil's federal police force is very small and plays little role in maintaining internal
 security. The military police courts (distinct from the armed forces' courts-martial)
 are overloaded, seldom conduct rigorous investigations of fellow officers, and rarely
 convict them. The separate system of state military police courts creates a climate
 of impunity for police elements involved in extrajudicial killings or abuse of pris-
 oners, which is the single largest obstacle to altering police behavior to eliminate
 such abuses.
 Brazil exports primary products and has a large industrial sector. Gross domestic
 product was $456 billion in 1993, and the economy grew at a rate of 5 percent in
 1994. The Government issued a new currency in July and brought down the rate
 of inflation from 50 percent a month to less than 2 percent by Se ptember. Large
 disparities in income distribution continued, with the poorest fifth o the population
 receiving only 2 percent of the national income, while the richest tenth hold 51 per-
 cent.
 The most serious human rights abuses continued to be some instances of
 extrajudicial killings and torture committed by the police. Justice is slow and unreli-
 
 
 able, especially in rural areas where powerful landowners use violence to settle land
 disputes and influence the local judiciary. In urban areas, the police are frequently
 implicated in killings and abuse of prisoners, but the special police courts rarely in-
 vestigate effectively or bring the accused to trial. Regular courts did take up two
 high-profile cases of extrajudicial killing, and both cases were still pending at year's
 end (see Section L.a.). The poor, predominantly from racial minorities, bear the
 brunt of most violence, whether committed by the police or by criminals. Indigenous
 peoples, despite constitutional guarantees, remain the victims of abuse and neglect,
 with continued invasions of their land. Laws against forced labor are not adequately
 enforced, and children are exploited in the sugar and charcoal industries. A free
 press and active human rights organizations expose abuses and demand action to
 stop them. The Federal Government has made efforts to respond to human rights
 abuses.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Extrajudicial killings continued to
 be a serious problem throughout the country.
 There are no reliable statistics on the number of people that police, vigilante
 groups, or hired gunmen murder annually. City morgue statistics frequently fail to
 distinguish between murder and accident victims. The police investigations in 90
 percent of the cases were insufficient for any judicial action, according to a recent
 study of 3,236 homicide victims in Rio de Janeiro by the Higher Institute for Studies
 of Religion (ISER). In Sao Paulo, the official statistics on the number of civilians
 killed by police fail to include those who are wounded and die later in the hospital.
 According to these statistics, the number of civilians killed by Sao Paulo state's mili-
 tary police dropped from an average of 86 per month in 1991 and 1992 to 21 per
 month in 1994. No national figures are available, but this drop in killings in Brazil's
 largest city is significant. Both lethal and nonlethal confrontations with police have
 fallen steadily since 1991. Human rights groups attributed this decrease to the state
 government's appointment of a new state secretary for public security who made
 clear that abuses would have to stop. This leadership, along with courses in human
 rights, internal transfers, and the threat of punishment reduced the number of
 killings.
 The special police courts have not yet tried the 120 police accused of the 1992
 Carandiru prison massacre. The police prosecutor predicted he would conclude this
 case with convictions in early 1995, but other lawyers following the trial estimated
 that it would take much longer. (Police courts are special courts with jurisdiction
 over the state police; see Section 1.e.)
 In Rio de Janeiro, the execution-style killing of street children continued, accord-
 ing to reliable reports from organizations aiding the youths. Five policemen, indicted
 for the July 1993 killings of eight street children in downtown Candaria square,
 were still in jail awaiting trial by regular courts. Their case was kept out of the spe-
 cial police courts because they were not on duty at the time and apparently did not
 use police equipment in the crime. Similarly, the regular court system is trying the
 cases of 33 members of the police gang accused of murdering 21 Vigario Geral resi-
 dents in 1993, but the number of the defendants and appeals involved means the
 case is moving very slowly, with no trial date set. One of the defendants escaped
 from custody of his fellow policemen; two others fled before being arrested.
 Despite efforts to prosecute the most notorious police crimes and to improve train-
 ing, the Rio de Janeir state government made little progress in stopping the high
 number of murders in Rio de Janeiro. Some crimes appear to be politically moti-
 vated, such as the murder of two black Workers' Party (PT) activists June 13. Un-
 known gunmen killed the two PT members shortly after they denounced police
 crimes at a party meeting to discuss security issues; police investigating the murder
 accused a common criminal.
 On October 31, the Government sent in the armed forces to control crime in Rio
 de Janeiro, placing civil and military police forces under the command of a general.
 The joint military-police operations to seize arms and drugs in Rio's slums have
 been essentially nonviolent and popular with the city's residents. Military authori-
 ties denied allegations of illegal searches and arrests, saying they have worked
 closely with judges to obtain the necessary warrants. The authorities are investigat-
 ing media reports of beatings and mistreatment.
 In the state of Sao Paulo, the June 11 murder of a union organizer and his wife,
 members of the Socialist Party of Unified Workers (PSTU), appeared to be a profes-
 sional killing, with few clues found by police investigators. Colleagues of the couple
 
 
 334
 in the town of Sao Carlos believe they were killed to prevent a repeat of the success-
 ful strike they organized against the local sugar refineries in 1993.
 Throughout Brazil, local human rights organizations point to excessive use of
 force by police. The police killed Fernando Neves, an employee of the Sao Martinho
 association for street children, shooting him four times as he rode his bicycle home
 crossing the path of police pursuing a car thief. Neves' family received threats for
 demanding an investigation, and the police officers identified by an internal inquiry
 as responsible for the shooting remained on active duty. Rio de Janeiro's governor
 acknowledged police abuses, including summary executions, in the October 18 raid
 against drug gan s in the Nova Brasilia slum that resulted in 13 deaths. In the
 southern state of Santa Catarina, state military policemen were accused of shooting
 an unarmed, escaped prisoner 12 times. The authorities in Rio Grande do Sul held
 state military policemen responsible for the killing of a prisoner in his hospital bed;
 he had been recovering from wounds received in a gunfight that left a policeman
 dead.
 The Luiz Freire Cultural Center/Legal Advisory Service, a prominent human
 rights group in the northeastern state of Pernambuco, reported the number of mur-
 ders there were on the increase, with a total of 1,847 between January 1993 and
 July 1994. In those cases in which the killers could be identified by some evidence,
 the group attributed 11 percent of the murders to extermination squads and 5 per-
 cent to police.
 In the northeastern state of Alagoas, the governor's temporary appointment of an
 army colonel to command police forces in 1993 dramaticaly reuced the number of
 murders involving the state military police. The Permanent Forum against Violence
 in Alagoas a locally prominent human ri hts group, implicated the police in only
 56 out of the 434 murders in Alagoas in rhe first half of 1994, in contrast to 1992
 when human rights monitors attributed 80 percent of 600 homicides to police forces.
 A high crime rate, a failure to apprehend most criminals, and an inept criminal
 justice system all contribute to public acquiescence in police brutality and killings
 of criminal suspects. Acts of intimidation, including death threats against witnesses,
 prosecutors, judges, and human rights mnitors, often hindered investigation into
 these incidents. Sao Paulo state military police prosecutors Stella Kuhiman and
 Marco Antonio Ferreira Lima received death threats warning them to stop inves-
 tigating police crimes; Kuhlman found a bloodied doll and a miniature casket left
 inside her office as a warning. Another Sao Paulo prosecutor investigating police
 corruption, Eliana Passarelli, was threatened. In Rio de Janeiro, judges, the chief
 prosecutor investigating police links to organized crime, and workers aiding street
 children have all received death threats. An international lawyers' committee report
 emphasized the extraordinarily high rate of threats against judges and lawyers in
 Brazil.
 In rural areas in the north and northeast, landowners often intimidated judges,
 lawyers, and police by violence and threats of violence. For example, in the northern
 state of Para, the mayor of Xinguara and several landowners stand accused of plot-
 ting the murder of a rural union leader in 1991, but their cases have yet to be tried.
 In 1994, eight persons were killed, three escaped attempts on their lives, and sev-
 eral families fled Xinguara after learning their names were on the landowners'
 "death list." These death lists include not just rural union leaders but anyone be-
 lieved to be on the side of squatters, such as shopkeepers who sell to them. Land-
 owners also threatened three Catholic priests, including father Ricardo Rezende of
 the neighboring town of Rio Maria. Local officials, who are linked to the mayor, took
 no action to investigate the killings or to protect those on the death list.
 On June 23 in Rio Maria, where six rural union leaders have been gunned down
 since 1985 the authorities tried the man accused of the attempted murder of union
 leader Cals CabraL The defendant confessed to firing the shots, and witnesses tes-
 tified that he earlier had offered them money to kill Cabral. The local jury ruled
 the crime was not premeditated, however, and the judge gave the gunman a sus-
 pended sentence. In contrast when a court granted a change of venue from Rio
 Maria to the state capital of Belem 600 miles away, a jury convicted the ex-police-
 man hired to kill Cabrals two fellow union leaders. The judge sentenced the killer
 to 50 years in prison, but he escaped with three other inmates on October 24. The
 authorities have not brought any of the landowners who contracted for the killings
 to trial.
 However, on December 16 the courts convicted a gunman, and the ranch foreman
 who hired him, of killing union leader Expedito de Souze in 1991, and sentenced
 them to 24- and 21-year prison terms. However, the ranch owner-also accused of
 the crime-failed to appear for trial. Despite a warrant for his arrest, he remains
 at large (see Section L.e.).
 
 
 The Catholic Church's Pastoral Land Commission (CPT) reported that land dis-
 putes resulted in 62 persons murdered in 1993, and the CPT reported 37 such mur-
 ders in the first 10 months of 1994.
 The high level of crime and the failings of the judicial system also contribute to
 public tolerance of vigilante lynchings of suspected criminals. Lynching occurred in
 all regions of the country, but the state of Bahia had the record number of
 lynchings-84-in 1993, and mobs killed 15 persons there in the first 8 months of
 1994. In Salto de Lontra, in the southern state of Parana, a mob took an accused
 murderer out of the police lockup in April and killed him while police watched.
 There continued to be reports of murders of homosexuals, where the identity of
 the killers remains unknown. In the Porto Alegre area, such assailants murdered
 five transvestites, while others have been beaten and robbed. On October 8, a mili-
 tary police court in Sao Paulo reduced the sentence of a policeman convicted of kill-
 ing a transvestite from 12 to 6 years, noting that being a transvestite was a "high
 risk" activity. Prosecutors said they would appeal the decision, and several prosecu-
 tors and law professors characterized the court's action as illegal.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated abductions.
 Human rights gups often blamed the police or vigilante groups for the disappear-
 ance of street children or persons believed to be criminals.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and contains severe legal penalties for torture or
 acquiescence in it. Yet the absence of any law defining torture has led to nearly
 total impunity. On June 23, a divided Supreme Court ruled on a torture case; five
 justices voted to absolve a policeman, based on the argument that Congress had
 failed to incorporate torture into the Penal Code, but six justices prevailed to convict
 the defendant based on the statutes defining norms for juvenile justice, which speci-
 fy penalties for torture. (The victim was a minor when he was beaten into
 confessing a crime in August 1991.)
 There are frequent credible reports that police beat and torture criminal suspects
 to extract information, confessions, or money. In Rio de Janeiro, law enforcement
 officials have acknowledged that physical abuse of prisoners is common, and in Sep-
 tember the civil police established a special unit to investigate charges of torture.
 In the state of Ceara, the Bar Association reported that a police inspector charged
 with one case of torture in 1993 was later found to be involved in 16 other incidents,
 but the inspector remained on the force while criminal proceedings continued more
 than a year later.
 Brazil's overcrowded prisons held 128,465 inmates in space designed for 51,368.
 There are often six to eight prisoners in a cell meant for three; some prisoners force
 others to pay for the use of a bed. The Ministry of Justice reported that rebellions
 average 2 per day, attempted or successful escapes, 3 per day. The Archbishop of
 Ceara, Aloisio Lorscheider, after investigating conditions at a prison near Fortaleza
 on March 15 (and being held hostage temporarily), reported to the city council about
 torture of prisoners, "food not fit for cockroaches," and lack of hygiene.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution limits arrests to those
 caught in the act of committing a crime or those arrested by order of a judicial au-
 thority. The authorities usually respect the constitutional provision for a judicial de-
 termination of the legality of detention, although some convicted inmates are held
 beyond their sentences due to poor record keeping. The law permits provisional de-
 tention for up to 5 days under specified conditi~ons during a police investigation, but
 a judge may extend this period. However, the polie sometimes detain street youths
 illegally without a judicia order or hold them in inommunicado detention.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The judiciary is an independent branch of govern-
 ment, but in many instances it is unable to ensure the right to fair trial. The judi-
 cial system, with the Federal Supreme Court at its apex, includes courts of first in-
 stance and appeals courts. States organize their own judicial systems but must ad-
 here to the basic principles in the Federal Constitution. Brazil also has a system
 of specialized courts dealing with police, labor, elections, juveniles, and family mat-
 ters.
 Special police courts have jurisdiction over the state military police; the record of
 these courts shows that punishment is the exception rather than the rule. A human
 rights group in the northeast, studying police crimes against civilians judged in po-
 lice courts over two decades (1970-1991), found only 8 percent of the cases resulted
 in convictions. In Sao Paulo, another study found that only 5 percent result in con-
 victions. The courts (which are separate from the courts martial of the armed forces,
 except for the final appeals court) are composed of four ranking military police offi-
 cials and one civilian judge. With too few judges for the caseload, there are backlogs,
 and human rights groups report a lack of zeal among police charged with investigat-
 
 
 336
 ing fellow officers. An attempt in Congress to pass a law giving ordinary courts ju-
 ritdiction over police crimes against civilians remained stalled in 1994.
 Defendants are entitled to counsel and must be made fully aware of the charges
 against them. In cases in which a defendant cannot afford an attorney, the court
 must provide one at public expense courts are supposed to appoint private attor-
 neys to represent poor defendants when public defenders are unavailable, but there
 is often a de facto lack of defense. Juries try only cases of willful crimes against
 lifena judge t ries all others
 he right oa fair public trial, as provided for by law, is generally respected in
 practice, although in rua areas the 4udiciary is less capable and more subject to
 the influence ofoc  landowners, particularly in cases reated to indigenous peoples
 and rural union activists. Local police are less zealous in investigating, prosecutors
 are reluctant to initiate proceedings, and judges find reasons to delay when cases
 involve gunmen contracted by landowners to elminate squatters or rural union ac-
 tivists.
 The need for judicial reform is widely recognized because the current system is
 inefficient, with backlogs of cases and shortages of judges. In Manaus the authori-
 ties took no action in 80 percent of the crimes against life that should have gone
 to juries, due to insufficient police action to gather evidence.
 Out of 176 townships in the northeast state of Pernambuco, 73 do not have a
 judge. Low pay, combined with exacting competitive exams that in some years elimi-
 nate 90 percent of the applicants, makes it difficult to fill vacancies on the bench.
 Due to the backlog of cases, under the Brazilian system where a trial must be held
 within a certain period of time from the date of the crime (similar to a statute of
 limitations), old cases are frequently dismissed. According to a former judge, this
 encourages corrupt judges purposely to delay certain cases so they can be dismissed.
 f. Arbitrary Ineerence With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for freedom from arbitrary intrusion into the home. There
 were no reports of illegal entry for political reasons, but illegal entry into homes
 without a warrant occurs in searches for criminal suspects. A women's rights gup
 in the city of Porto Alegre reported suspected oice involvement in five break-ins
 at its offices-each time its files on spousal ause and finances were ransacked.
 Wiretaps are unconstitutional except when authorized by a judicial authority for
 purposes of criminal investigation and prosecution. The inviolability of private cor-
 respondence is respected.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The 1988 Constitution abolished all forms of
 censorship and provides for the right to free speech and to a free press. The authori-
 ties respect these rights in practice. The press and broadcast media routinely dis-
 cuss controversial social and political issues and engage in investigative reporting.
 Most radio and television stations are privately owned; but the Government controls
 licensing authority and politicians frequently obtain the licenses. Eighteen television
 and 115 radio stations are owned by current or former congressmen, some of whom
 are or were members of the committee overseeing communications. Newspapers and
 magazines, which are privately owned, vigorously report and comment on govern-
 ment performance.
 Congress is considering changing the penalty for libel under the 1967 Press
 Law-a prison term-which judges consider extreme. The Foiha de Sao Paulo news-
 paper called current legal regulation of the press "an archaic and authoritarian
 press law inherited from the military regime." The 1994 Inter-American Press Asso-
 ciation (LAPA) report on freedom of the press in Brazil said, "there has been increas-
 ing recourse to the (1967) press law, especially by the executive and the judiciary,
 against journalists." According to the report, the courts tried seven journalists and
 a labor leader for libel and defamation of character under this law after complaints
 by the executive branch; they jailed one and freed the others as first-time offenders.
 Lucio Flavio Pinto, an independent journalist in Belem, Para state, had to close his
 weekly newsletter in order to defend himself against the suits brought by the own-
 ers of the city's major newspaper for libel and defamation under the 1967 press law.
 The IAPA also called for an investigation into the February killing of a newspaper
 publisher in Vitoria da Conuista, Baa state. In the state of Sergipe, four journal-
 ists received death threats aer criticizing the police in their newsletter.
 Foreign publications are widely distributed in Brazil; prior review of films, plays,
 and radio and television programming is practiced only to determine a suitable
 viewing age.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to assemble peacefully, and this right is respected in practice. Permits are
 
 
 337
 not required for outdoor political or labor meetings, and such meetings occur fre-
 quently.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no favored or state religion. All faiths are free
 to establish places of worship, train clergy, and proselytize, although the Govern-
 ment controls entry into Indian lands.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Count, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on movement within Brazil, except for the
 protected Indian areas, nor are there any restrictions on emigration or return. Some
 towns in the south, however, were reported to be trying to block the entry of poor
 migrants from the north. Brazil admits few immigrants, does not formally accept
 refugees for resettlement, and is selective in granting asylum.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights. The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change their government
 through free elections, and citizens exercised this right in 1994, filling executive and
 legislative offices throughout the country. Brazilians chose the President, two-thirds
 of the Senate, 513 federal deputies, 27 governors, and members of state assemblies
 from a multitude of parties and alliances.
 Voting is secret and mandatory for all literate Brazilian citizens aged 18 to 70,
 except military conscripts who may not vote. It is voluntary for minors aged 16 to
 18 for the illiterate, and for those aged 70 and over.
 Women have full political rights under the Constitution, and they are becoming
 active in politics an government. In the 1994 elections, voters elected 1 female gov-
 ernor and 34 women to the Chamber of Deputies (out of 513 seats). Five women
 serve in the Senate (out of 81). The 1988 Constitution gave Indians the franchise,
 but their ability to protect their own interests is severely limited (see Section 5).
 Eight Indian candidates ran for office in 1994, but none was elected.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Brazilian nongovernmental organizations (NG(Ys) actively investigate allegations
 of human rights violations and often initiate legal proceedings. Several international
 NGO's either maintain offices in Brazil or visit periodically. Government entities,
 such as the Ministry of Justice's secretaries for citizenship and human rights or the
 federal prosecutor's office, respond readily to inquiries about human rights cases
 and launch their own investigations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Discrimination on the basis of sex, race, religion, and nationality is unconstitu-
 tional, yet women, blacks, and indigenous people continued to experience discrimi-
 nation.
 Women.-The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex in employment
 or salaries and provides for 120 days of paid maternity leave. The provision against
 wage discrimination is rarely enforced, however, and, as a reaction against the ma-
 ternity leave law, some employers seek sterilization certificates from prospective
 employees or ty to avoid hiring women of childbearing age.
 There is a high incidence of physical abuse against women, and 125 cities have
 established special plice offices to deal with crimes against women. One Rio de Ja-
 neiro office reported that more women were submitting complaints, which increased
 from 80 per month in 1993 to 300 per month in 1994, andthat 80 percent of the
 complaints involved spousal abuse. Both Porto Alegre and Sao Paulo, which has 120
 lice offices for women, found a similar trend of more women reporting complaints.
 The women generally asked police to talk to their husbands, rather than taking
 len rual areas, women have little recourse since there are no specialized police
 offices available to them. Men who commit crimes against women, ncluding sexual
 assault and murder, are unlikely to be brought to trial. Although the Supreme
 Court struck down in 1991 the archaic concept of "defense of honor" as a justifica-
 tion for wife murder, courts are still reluctant to prosecute and convict men who
 attack their wives.
 Chidren.-Despite p    hrgressive laws to protect children and a growing awareness
 of their plight thurough media and NO campaigns, the Government still has not
 been able to help miliions of children who fail to get an education, who work to sur-
 vive and who suffer from the poverty afflicting their families. A 1994 report issued
 by the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics indicated that upwards of
 2 million children between 10 and 13 years of age work, many of them together with
 
 
 338
 their parents, under conditions approximating forced labor or debt bondage (see Sec-
 tion 64.). Many other children are found b     on the streets of cities.
 There are no reliable figures on the    r of street children, some of whom are
 homeless, but the majority of whom return home at night. In Rio de Janeiro, an
 organization aiding street children estimated that 30,000 frequent the streets by
 day, but less than 1,000 probably sleep there. NGO's have made enough shelters
 available for homeless children, but some prefer the freedom and drugs that street
 life offers. In Sao Paulo, a survey of street children published in March found 4,500
 on the streets by day and 900 at night, but the survey's methodology has been criti-
 cized because surveyors worked from cars, without walking into dark alleys. The
 Government response to the plight of street children has been slow and ineffective.
 For example, the Sao Paulo State Council for the Rights of Children has never ac-
 quired meeting space nor have its government members been named.
 The report of a congressional investiga  committee on child prostitution, pub-
 lished in June, called for mere targeted  ropm _as, changes in the Penal Code,
 and enforcement of existing laws to protect children, noting police complicity in
 child prostitution in moat states. The committee concluded that there was no evi-
 dence to back the claim that an estimated 500,000 minors are involved in prostitu-
 tion in Brazil, but they found appalling cases in all 10 states visited. In Rio de Ja-
 neiro, a study cited by the committee found 600 girls between the ages of 8 and 15
 involved in prostitution, all of them glue sniffers or drug users, mot first raped at
 an early age.
 Indigenous People&-Brazil's approximately 250,000 Indians, who speak 170 dif-
 ferent langages, have a constitutional right to their traditional lands. In practice,
 however, the authorities allow most indigenous peoples only limited participation in
 decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, and the allocation of natural re-
 sources. The 1988 Constitution charged the Federal Government with demarcating
 519 indigenous areas within 5 years, but the authorities have yet to complete more
 than half the demarcations and entitling decrees. The lower house of Congress
 passed a law in 1994 to implement constitutional provisions with respect to Indian
 btth   Senate took no action.
 TeConstitution provides Indians the exclusive use of the soil, waters, and min-
 erals found in their lands, subject to congressional authorization. The legal regula-
 tions necessay for economic exploitation are still pending before the Senate as part
 of the Indian rights bill. nllegal mining, logging, and ranching are a constant prob-
 lem on Indian lands, as an estimated 84 percent of them have been occupied by non-
 Indians. Approximately 2,500 gold miners reentered the Yanomami reserve in the
 state of Roraima in 1994, causing another surge in the number of Indians dyng
 from malaria and other diseases. Malaria killed at least 26 Yanomami, in p art due
 to the Federal Government's failure to provide adequate medical care for indigenous
 9        case agst the Brazilian gold miners who killed 16 Yanomami on the
 Venezuelan side ofthe border remains mired in legal problems. None of the accused
 miners are in custody. Yanomami witnesses failed to recognize two of the accused,
 and other witnesses have disappeared. Also in Roraima state, four Macuxi Indians
 were murdered in the Raposa-Serra do Sal area, which is still not demarcated be-
 cause the order has been stalled in the Justice Minister's office for more than a
 year.
 The Catholic Church's Indigenist Council reported in 1993 that mre than 7,400
 Indians were trapped into forced labor (see section 6.c.). The majority were Guarani
 Indians in the state of Mate Grosso do Sul. With 10 Guarani communities embroiled
 in legal battles for their land, there were a few victories in 1994. The Sete Cerros
 Guarani won a federal Supreme Court order tosp a local federal judge from grant-
 ing ranchers the right to occupy demarcated Guarani land. The regional appeals
 court in Sao Paulo ruled in favor of the Jaguari co mniy  ordering FUNAI to re-
 stre the Guarani to their homeland and evict the non-Indians. FUNAI carried out
 the order with police assistance. In Para state, the Xikrim Indians won a court in-
 auction blocking two major logging firms from extracting mahogany from their
 In the absence of government action, indigenous groups have ben to take mat-
 ters into their own hands. Xerente Indians in Tocantins successfully stopped the
 state government from building a road into their territory by seizing the site. (The
 state government had ignored a federal injunction supporting the Xerente.) In Sep-
 tember Kayapo Indians decided to expel 2,000 gold miners from their territory, for-
 ing the local government and federal authorities to deal with the problem.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Although racial discrimination has been ille-
 gal sine 1951, darker-skinned Brazilians frequently enounter discrimination. Most
 dlack Brazilians are found among the poorest sectors of society. Even though nearly
 
 
 339
 half of Brazil's opulation has some African ancestry, very few senior officials in
 government or the armed forces are black. There are few blacks in senior private
 sector management positions. Black consciousness organizations challenge the view
 that Brazil is a racial democracy with equal treatment regardless of skin color. They
 assert that racial discrimination becomes most evident when blacks seek employ-
 ment, housing, or educational opportunities.
 The news magazine Veja reported that whites in the predominantly black city of
 Salvador, Bahia, earn on average three times more than blacks, while in the south-
 ern city of Curitiba, whites earned 1.5 times the black average. The magazine at-
 tributed the difference between the two cities to better public education in the
 south. In many southern cities, however, municipal governments try to prevent the
 migration of poor families from the northeast, who are often identified by their
 color. For example, city officials in Blumenau, Santa Catarina state, routinely
 screen incoming bus passengers and strongly encourage those who are nonwhite and
 without employment to leave on the next bus.
 Racism, as a crime is difficult to prove in courts, although both Sao Paulo and
 Rio de Janeiro have Aesignated special police units to investigate it. When a black
 activist, Jane Makebe, was told by a friend that she lost a job with a cellular phone
 company because the owner did not want any black employees, she filed a complaint
 with Sao Paulo's racial crimes police. However, the witness, Makebe's friend, re-
 fused to testify for fear of losing her job.
 People With Disabilities.-The 1988 Constitution contains several provisions for
 the disabled, stipulating a minimum salary, educational opportunities, and access
 to public buildings as well as public transportation. Groups that work with the dis-
 ab ed, however, report that state governments completely failed to meet the legally
 mandated targets for educational opportunities and work placement. The elimi-
 nation of architectural barriers to the disabled made little progss; the mayor's of-
 fice in Recife (Brazil's sixth largest city) conducted a survey of 80 public buildings,
 fmding none with adequate access for the handicapped.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Labor Code provides for union representation
 of all workers (excepting military, military police, and firemen) but imposes a hier-
 archical, unitary system, funded by a mandatory "union tax" on workers and em-
 ployers. Under a restriction known as "unicidade" (one per city), the Code prohibits
 multiple unions of the same professional category in a given geographical area. The
 1988 Constitution freed workers to organize new unions out of old ones without
 prior authorization from the Government but retained other provisions of the old
 Code. Elements of Brazil's labor movement and the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) criticize the retention of unicidade and the union tax.
 In practice, unicidade has proven less restrictive in recent years, as more liberal
 interpretations of its restrictions permitted new unions to form and-in many
 cases--to compete with unions and federations that had already enjoyed official rec-
 ognition. The sole bureaucratic requirement for new unions is to register with the
 Ministry of Labor which, by judicial decision, is bound to receive and record their
 registration. The primary source of continuing restriction is the system of labor
 courts, which retain the right to review the registration of new unions and to adju-
 dicate confficts over their formation. Otherwise, unions are independent of the Gov-
 ernment and of political parties.
 Approximately 20 to 30 percent of the Brazilian work force is organized, with just
 over half of this number affiliated with an independent labor central. Intimidation
 of rural labor union organizers by landowners and their agents continues to be a
 problem (see Section L.a.).
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike (excepting, again, military, police,
 and firemen, but including other civil servants). Enabling legislation passed in 1989
 stipulates that essential services must remain in operation during a strike and that
 workers must notify employers at least 48 hours before beginning a walkout. The
 Constitution prohibits government interference in labor unions but provides that
 "abuse' of the right to strike (such as not maintaining essential services, or failure
 to end a strike after a labor court decision) is punishable by law.
 Federal police, federal customs inspectors, bankworkers, autoworkers, oilworkers,
 teachers, and federal and state government employees went on strike in 1994. For-
 merly, the courts ruled virtually automatically that stries were abusive; in recent
 years, however, the courts have applied the law with more discretion. The 1989
 strike law prohibits dismissals or the hiring of substitute workers during a strike,
 with certain exceptions, provided the strike is not ruled abusive.
 Although the law makes no prevision for a central labor organization three major
 groups have emerged. the Sole Workers Central (CUT), the General Workers Con-
 
 
 340
 federation (CGT), and Forca Sindical. The centrals do not have legal standing to
 represent professional categories of workers, but all three centrals can effectively ac-
 quesuch stang by affiliating with existing statewide federations or nationwide
 confederations, or by forming new federations and confederations, challenging the
 old structure. The status of the federations and confederations created since 1991
 remains in doubt, however, as a result of a challenge in the labor courts by the old
 organizations.
 unions and centrals freely affiliate with international trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to organize. With some government assistance, businesses and unions are
 working to expand and improve mechanisms of collective bargaining. The scope of
 issues legally susceptible to collective bargaining is narrow, however, and the labor
 court system exercises normative powers with regard to the settlement of labor dis-
 putes, thus discouraging direct negotiation. Existing law charges these same courts,
 as well as the Labor Ministry, with mediation responsibility in the preliminary
 stages of dispute settiement. i many cases, free negotiations set wages; labor court
 decsions set them in others. The International Labor Organization (ILO) notes that
 important differences in wages continue to exist to the detriment of women and
 blacks, particularly in the rural sectors (see Section 5). Beginning in 1990, the Fed-
 eral Government attempted to control salary increases in order to limit inflation.
 After introducing the new currency unit and an economic stabilization plan in mid-
 1994, the Government took an active role in auto industry negotiations to minimize
 the negative effect of a wage settlement on the economy.
 The Constitution incorporates a provision from the Labor Code which prohibits
 the dismssal of employees who are candidates for or holders of union leadership po-
 sitions. Nonetheless, dismissals take place, with those dismissed required to resort
 to a usually lengthy court process for relief. In general, the authorities do not effec-
 tively enforce laws protecting union members from discrimination. Union officials
 estimate that only 5 percent of such cases reaching the labor court system are re-
 solved within days through a preliminary judicial order. The other 95 percent gen-
 erally take 5 to 10 years (and sometimes more) to resolve.
 Labor law applies equally in the free trade zones. However, the unions in the
 Manaus free trade zone, like rural unions and many unions in smaller cities, are
 relatively weaker vis-a-vis industry as compared to unions in the major industrial
 centers.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Although the Constitution pro-
 hibits forced labor, there were credible reports of forced labor in many parts of
 Brazil. The Federal Government admits that existing enforcement resources are in-
 adequate. In 1994 the Catholic Church's Pastoral Land Commission denounced 29
 cases of forced labor, involving a total of 19940 workers, an increase from the
 16,442 reported in the previous year. The CPT reported cases of forced labor in 12
 different states, including many Guarani Indians in Mato Grosso do Sul. Forced
 labor is common on farms producing charcoal for use in the iron foundries and steel
 industries, and in the sugar industry (see also Section 6.d.).
 State and federal authorities have generally not conducted timely investigations
 of reports of compulsory labor, claiming lack of resources. Local police admit that
 overseers or owners of many farms withhold pay from migrant laborers and use
 force to retain and intimidate them, but the jurisdiction for such violations falls to
 the Ministry of Labor, which has only 2,300 inspectors for all Brazil. Labor organi-
 zations alleged that in mining and the rural economy thousands of workers, includ-
 ing minors, are hired on the basis of false promises, subjected to debt bondage, with
 violence used to retain or punish workers who attempt to escape.
 The Labor Ministry conducted investigations at the 29 alleged sites of forced labor
 the CPT reported to the International Labor Organization, and said it found no
 proof of forced labor. The inspectors, however, did report violations of the Labor
 Code and subhuman working conditions. The CPT noted that the delay-in some
 cases years--in investigating these sites, and the fact that employers were often
 alerted before the arrival of inspectors, made confirmation of forced labor unlikely,
 emphasizing the need for timely, surprise inspections. In March the Labor Ministry
 issued regulations to guide inspectors in documenting forced labor, but NGO's and
 federal prosecutors report that enforcement remains a problem.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum working age under
 the Constitution is 14 years, except for apprentices. Judges can authorize employ-
 ment for children under 14 years of age when they feel it appropriate. The authori-
 ties rarely enforce legal restrictions intended to protect working minors under age
 18, however, and the problem is widespread. The law requires permission of the par-
 ents or guardians for minors to work, and they must attend school through the pri-
 mary grades. The law bars all minors from night work, work that constitutes a
 
 
 341
 physical strain, and employment in unhealthful, dangerous, or morally harmful con-
 ditions.
 Despite these legal restrictions, official figures state that nearly 3 million 10- to
 14-year-old children (or 4.6 percent of the work force) were employed. Many children
 are forced to work along side their parents in cane fields, cutting hemp or feeding
 wood into charcoal ovens; frequent accidents unhealthy working conditions, and
 squalor are common in these cases. At sawmills in the state of Rondonia, 20 teen-
 agers lost fingers or suffered other accidents but were not entitled to compensation
 because they were employed illegally.
 Independent shoe manufacturers in Franca (Sao Paulo state) continue to employ
 thousands of children under age 14, in violation of the law. Public prosecutors
 brought suit in November against five major Franca shoe manufacturers for illegally
 subcontracting work which led to the exploitation of child labor. Sugar cane growers
 illegally employ children and adolescents from 7 to 17 years of age, many cutting
 cane with mac etes. Specific reports of minors working illegally also involve orange
 growers in Sao Paulo, street vendors in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, and mining
 and logging industries in the Amazon region.
 The Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcement of child labor laws, but it
 has too few inspectors to do so effectively. The widely held view that it is better
 for minors to work than to be involved in street crime also hampers enforcement
 efforts.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Prior to July the Government adjusted the na-
 tional minimum wage every month. With the midyear introduction of the economic
 stabilization plan, it set the minimum wage at $83 (70 reals) per month. The
 Interunion Department for Socioeconomic Studies and Statistics estimated that the
 minimum wage is less than one-fifth that necessary (based on a standard set by the
 1988 Constitution) to support a family of four. The most recently available national
 survey (for 1990) showed that 35 percent of economically active individuals, includ-
 ing minors from 10 to 14 years of age, earned no more than the minimum wage.
 Many workers, particularly outside the regulated economy and in the northeast, re-
 portedly earnedless than the minimum wage.
 The 1988 Constitution limits the workweek to 44 hours and specifies a weekly
 rest period of 24 consecutive hours, preferably on Sundays. The Constitution ex-
 panded pay and fringe benefits and established new protections for agricultural and
 domestic workers; however, the Government does not enforce all of these provisions.
 Unsafe working conditions are prevalent throughout Brazil. Incomplete figures
 from the Government's Social Security Administration for workplace accidents and
 fatalities in 1993 showed 412,293 reported accidents; 3,110 resulted in fatalities and
 16,875 caused permanent disabilities. Fundacentro, part of the Ministry of Labor,
 sets occupational health and safety standards. However, the Ministry has insuffi-
 cient resources for adequate inspection and enforcement of these standards. There
 were also credible allegations of corruption within the enforcement system. If a
 worker has a problem in the workplace and has trouble getting relief directly from
 his employer, he or his union can file a claim with the regional labor court, although
 in practice this is frequently a cumbersome, protracted process.
 The law requires employers to establish internal commissions for accident preven-
 tion in workplaces. The law protects employee members of these commissions from
 being fired for commission activities. Such firings, however, do occur, and legal re-
 course usually requires years for resolution.
