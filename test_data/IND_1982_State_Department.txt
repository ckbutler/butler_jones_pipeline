 INDIA
 India has a multiparty democratic political system in which
 power is divided between the national Government and 22 states
 under a federal constitution. A parliamentary framework, based
 on the British model, exists at both the national and state
 level. The Congress-I Party, headed by Prime Minister Indira
 Gandhi, holds a substantial majority in both houses of
 Parliament and in 15 state assemblies. Other parties control
 the remaining states.
 The economy of India is mixed. The Government controls such
 elements of the infrastructure as banks, insurance companies,
 railroads, most power stations, and a large share of heavy
 industry. The production of consumer goods, the entire
 agricultural sector, much of the road transport, and most
 marketing services are privately owned.
 India is a diverse country with 15 official languages and a
 population of 684 million, according to the 1981 census. While
 the great majority of the population is Hindu, India also has a
 large (70 million) Muslim minority, and large populations of
 Sikhs, Jains, and Christians; Parsis, Buddhists and Jews are
 also represented. India is a secular state.
 Basic human rights are well established in India. The
 judiciary is independent and the press vigorous and
 autonomous. Civil and political rights are fully observed.
 Except for an 18-month emergency period, June 1975 -*January
 1977, when many basic freedoms were suspended, Indian
 democratic institutions have been stable and effective. They
 have provided the framework for changes of government following
 national parliamentary elections in March 1977 and January
 1980. The next national elections are due no later than
 January 1985.
 The caste system remains an integral part of Indian social and
 cultural life. The Indian Government bans untouchability,
 however, and provides guidelines for affirmative action on
 behalf of socially disadvantaged groups (the scheduled castes,
 or untouchables; other groups at the lower end of the Hindu
 social hierarchy; and the scheduled tribes). The national and
 state governments provide untouchables preferential access to a
 wide range of special benefits including quotas in schools,
 government employment, and housing. In practice, however, the
 caste system, including untouchability, is the source of
 widespread discrimination.
 There have been considerable strains in India as the tradi-
 tional social and economic systems have come under the twin
 pressures of modernization and increasing democratization of
 politics. This has resulted in heavy burdens on the judicial,
 administrative, and law enforcement institutions, especially at
 the state level where most of the effective authority in these
 areas is wielded.
 During 1982, as earlier, human rights concerns arose out of the
 exercise of police authority. Despite legal protections,
 police brutality is widespread. In addition, the increasing
 tendency toward investigative reporting by the press has
 generated confrontations with some state governments and has
 resulted in special legislation in several states to curb what
 these state governments have referred to as "yellow
 journalism." This legislation has been widely protested as a
 limit on the freedom of the press.

 Terrorist attacks in the northeastern states of Mizoram and
 Manipur by groups aiming at secession of these regions from
 India continued to disrupt life there, as did sporadic violence
 surrounding the ethnic agitation movement in neighboring
 Assam. Attacks on untouchable Hindus in rural areas in
 northern India, alleged official repression in Tamil Nadu of
 those protesting local socio-economic conditions, and a
 reported increase in "dowry deaths" (i.e., young married women
 murdered because of their families' inability to provide
 additional dowry after their marriage) have all figured
 prominently in press and parliamentary attention to human
 rights issues in 1982.
 Human rights trends in India are mixed. In the short run
 India's positive human rights record is expected to continue.
 Paradoxically, the brief emergency experience probably
 strengthened human rights, since what had been taken for
 granted had to be explicitly defended. Such key institutions
 as the judiciary and the press now appear stronger and more
 vigilant regarding the protection of human rights.
 There is, however, some apprehension that the parliamentary
 system may be affected by what is seen as increasing
 parochialism in Indian politics and by the weakening of party
 structures. In addition, the pressure exerted by a growing
 population, reduced economic growth rates, and strong popular
 expectations will squeeze resources and could generate tensions
 affecting the political system. A stabilizing factor is that
 India's federal structure and cultural diversity help to
 contain regional disparities and conflicts.
 1.       Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Killing
 Killing for political motives is not common in India. Cases
 that do exist tend to be localized and sporadic, often
 reflecting underlying social tensions and strong party
 rivalries. A highly publicized example in 1982 was a series of
 murders in Kerala of members of the Communist Pary of India
 (Marxist) and of the right-wing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.
 Approximately six to ten militants in each group were murdered,
 reportedly for political motives, in the months preceding the
 May 1982 State Assembly elections. On April 30 in West Bengal
 17 members of the controversial Ananda Marg sect were killed by
 street mobs in Calcutta. Ananda Marg is a strong opponent of
 the ruling Communist Party Marxist there. The communist state
 government so far has failed to bring any of the ringleaders to
 trial or to issue a report of the judicial investigation
 ordered by the West Bengal Chief Minister. Individual
 political murders surrounding the election campaign for the May
 poll also escalated in West Bengal on both the communist and
 non-communist sides--for instance, at least 31 people were
 reported murdered between May 1 and July 31 in the Nadia
 District, an area where remmants of the extremist Naxalite
 movement still operate.
 In the more isolated northeast region of India, ethnic
 insurgent movements continued terrorist campaigns for secession
 from the union. Violent incidents particluarly in Manipur and
 Mizoram against Indian military personnel and non-indigenous
 civilian officials captured both press and official attention.
 
 
 1127
 According to an official statement in Parliament on February
 24, 1982, the Mizo National Front was believed responsible for
 the killing of 23 security personnel and 39 civilians and the
 forcible collection of $1.5 million in the period July 1979 -
 February 1982. In a two-week period of terrorism in June 1982,
 the Mizo National Front was accused by an Indian government
 spokesman of murdering two Mizos and nine non-Mizos in an
 effort to intimidate the Mizo population.
 In Manipur, groups demanding independence from India have used
 terrorist tactics. They are identified as the People's
 Liberation Army and the People's Revolutionary Party of
 Kanglepek. According to a March 31, 1982, official statement
 in Parliament, 49 security personnel were killed by these
 insurgent groups between September 1980 and March 1982. The
 most striking was an ambush in Manipur on February 19, 1982,
 when guerrillas of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland
 reportedly joined with the People's Liberation Army to kill 22
 Indian soldiers in an ambush of a military convoy. Other
 incidents in Manipur include an attack on a radio station in
 Imphal in December 1981 and the assassination of police and
 some local officials in early 1982.
 The Indian Army maintains a large permanent force in the
 northeast in support of civilian authorities and to conduct
 anti-guerrilla operations against the insurgent groups cited
 above. The Indian ArMy has sought also to launch a
 pacification campaign sponsoring civic projects among tribal
 communities, with mixed results. There have been some
 allegations of army brutality against the local population
 following attacks on military personnel. A fact-finding team
 of representatives of various women's organizations which
 traveled to the northeast in May 1982 later reported
 molestation of women and some looting, charges which have been
 denied by army spokesmen. Allegations of Chinese support for
 these ethnic insurgencies are denied by the Indian Government,
 though there is some evidence it existed in earlier years. The
 Mizo and Manipur insurgents profit by the difficult terrain and
 remoteness and maintain sanctuaries in northwest Burma and
 possibly in Bangladesh, although there is no conclusive
 evidence that either country supports the insurgents.
 b. Disappearance
 No instances have been reported of the abduction, secret
 arrest, clandestine detention, or disappearance of individuals
 at the hands of public authorities in India.
 c. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure
 (1973). The Indian Evidence Act requires a valid confession to
 be made in the presence of a magistrate. The Indian
 Constitution states that no one may be compelled to testify
 against himself. There is also ample case law extending over
 many decades demonstrating that recourse to torture in India
 for any purpose is contrary to law and that the introduction of
 confessions or information extracted by use of torture or force
 in trial procedure is inadmissible.
 Nonetheless, there is widespread circumstancial evidence that
 torture by the police does occur. Press reports in 1982
 indicated that police brutality applied to prisoners under
 
 15-480 0 - 83 - 72
 
 
 1128
 
 detention occurred in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Tamil
 Nadu. One press report indicated that 190 had died because of
 police brutality in Tamil Nadu. In general, the state
 governments deny that such deaths result from brutal
 treatment. While specific data are not easily obtainable,
 there is no doubt that police brutality is practiced in India,
 though conditions vary widely from state to state.
 d.   Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Such treatment or punishment is proscribed by law; there are no
 known instances of summary execution in India. Varying terms
 of imprisonment are imposed for crimes committed, as estab-
 lished in the criminal codes of India and the states.
 A more serious public issue in India is prison conditions. The
 continued presence of large numbers of persons awaiting trial
 has resulted in the crowding of jails in many parts of the
 country and the deterioration of conditions for all prisoners.
 Recent central Government statements have stressed the need by
 the states to review periodically the cases of those awaiting
 trial and to abide by Supreme Court guidelines in ensuring
 speedy trials.
 A feature of imprisonment inherited from the British colonial
 period, and still in effect in India, is a system of
 classification of prisoners related to differential prison
 conditions and special privileges. Thus, while ordinary (or
 class C) prisoners enjoy no special treatment, foreigners
 (Class B) and political prisoners (Class A) are entitled to
 less crowded cells, better food, and other amenities. Income
 tax-paying (i.e., middle class) prisoners are also often
 segregated from ordinary prisoners and granted more
 privileges. The special privileges for political prisoners
 date from the independence struggle when large numbers of
 respectable people, through a minor infraction of the law,
 courted arrest as a political statement. Support for these
 principles remains widespread in India.
 e.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Constitution provides that a person in custody must be
 informed of the grounds for arrest as soon as possible and have
 the right to be represented by counsel. Such persons must be
 brought before a magistrate within 24 hours of arrest and not
 be detained further without the magistrate's authority. No
 information has been received in 1982 suggesting that these
 provisions are not generally respected in practice.
 However, the Constitution also permits the enactment of
 preventive detention laws to "prevent threats to the public
 welfare and safeguard the national security." It requires that
 these laws provide for certain limits on the length of
 detention.
 In February 1980, Parliament ratified a preventive detention
 ordinance (the Prevention of Black Marketing and Essential
 Commodities) permitting the arrest of suspected "economic
 offenders." In December 1980, following severe rioting in
 northern India, Parliament ratified the National Security Act
 authorizing the central and state governments to order
 detention of individuals to prevent action "prejudicial to the
 defense or security of India, or to the maintenance of public
 order or the availability of supplies and services essential to
 the community."
 
 
 1129
 The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the National
 Security Act on December 28, 1981, but demanded that the
 central Government specify and define such concepts as
 "defense of India" and "essential services." The Government
 responded with a gazette notification on February 8, 1982,
 identifying 16 essential services, the disruption of which
 would invite detention under the National Security Act. The
 Supreme Court also upheld the right of detainees to have
 counsel of their own choice for their defense when appearing
 before the Advisory Boards.
 In many cases, detainees are held only a short time and
 released, particularly where detention follows serious
 rioting. There is no evidence that these mandates have been
 used against political opponents of the current administration
 in the absence of some other allegation, such as inciting to
 riot. According to press reports, about 400 persons had been
 detained under the National Security Act as of December 31,
 1981. Many of the 6000 or more brief preventive detentions
 just prior to the January 19 nationwide strike were carried out
 under the provisions of the National Security Act. According
 to an official statement in Parliament on May 5, 1982, 504
 persons had been ordered detained under the Maintenance of
 Supplies of Essential Commodities Act of 1980.
 f.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There is no constitutional guarantee of public trial. The
 criminal procedure code provides for open trial, but also
 permits the judiciary to close the proceedings in part or in
 whole. The Official Secrets Act also permits proceedings to be
 closed on the plea that publication of any evidence or
 statements would be prejudicial to the safety of the state.
 The Act requires, however, that the passing of sentence take
 place in public.
 In India there are effective legal procedures t* 6asure fair
 trial, despite thd closing procedures. Defendants are produced
 before a magistrate within 24 hours of arrest either to be
 remanded for further investigation or to be released on bail.
 Defendants have the right to selection of their own counsel who
 can and do effectively intervene at all stages of the judicial
 process. There exist well established and heavily used appeal
 channels at every stage. There is no military influence on any
 aspect of the working of the Indian judicial system. There are
 no political or security courts in India. The military
 services maintain their own internal judicial procedures which
 in general are not reviewed by civilian courts.
 The bar is independent of government at both the federal and
 state levels. Judges are appointed to the state high courts by
 the Law Ministry of the central Government following
 constitutionally mandated consultations with the Chief Justice
 of the Supreme Court of India.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The criminal procedure code requires warrants for searches and
 seizures, but also permits the police in the course of a
 criminal investigation to institute searches without warrant if
 otherwise there would be undue delay. In such a case, the
 officer must state in writing the grounds for making the search
 
 
 1130
 without a warrant and specifiy the object of the search. There
 is no indication that this provision has been abused in
 practice.
 Evidence has surfaced in the press that interception of private
 mail and the tapping of telephones is carried out in New Delhi
 by the Government. The March 31, 1982 issue of "India Today"
 magazine reported that over 300 organizations and indivi-
 duals, including Members of Parliament, were under such surveil-
 lance. This practice is authorized under the Indian Postal Act
 of 1853 and the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885 "on the occurrence
 of any public emergency or in the interest of the public safety
 or tranquility." These terms are not specifically defined.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution of India guarantees freedom of speech and
 press. Nevertheless, material deemed inciteful of religious or
 communal hatred is proscribed, and occasionally some
 publications will have offending issues banned or seized. A
 censorship board screens films before their distribution is
 licensed, and material deemed offensive to public morals or to
 religious and communal sentiment may be excised. The
 government-controlled All India Radio has a monopoly of radio
 and television broadcasts and is often accused by opposition
 parties of slanting its broadcast material to favor the ruling
 party. There is no censorship of domestic and foreign books or
 publications, or artistic works.
 There have been no restrictions in 1982 on criticism of the
 Government of India. The press has played a major role in
 exposing serious cases of corruption at a high level in the
 state governments. However, considerable public attention in
 -ndia was generated by legislation adopted in July 1982 by the
 Bihar state assmbly-to curb reporting-deemed "indecent or
 scurrilous" or "intended for blackmail." The Bihar Press Bill,
 as the proposed new act is known, is allegedly aimed at curbing
 "yellow journalism" which slanders public officials. Critics
 allege-that such charges, which could result in up to two years
 of imprisonment for convicted journalists, are difficult to
 define. Moreover, the bill vests authority in local
 magistrates appointed by the state government, as well as in
 established judicial magistrates, to order the arrest of
 offending journalists and to try them. To date the Bihar Press
 Bill has not been implemented as it has not received the
 necessary presidential assent and the controversy may be
 referred to the Supreme Court for ultimate decision on the
 bill's constitutionality.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The only limits on public meetings are those connected with
 crowd control, e.g., advance notification to police and the
 requirement of permits in some instances. Non-violent groups
 and parties of all persuasions are allowed to assemble freely,
 and no hindrance is generally imposed on their efforts to
 attract as large a participation as can be organized.
 Preventive detention laws are commonly used in advance of large
 gatherings at which, in the view of security authorities,
 violence is considered likely. Such short-term detentions --
 occasionally on a large scale -- are carried out not only in
 
 
 1131
 connection with labor events, but also before some religious
 and cultural gatherings. A ban was reimposed on the Mizo
 National Front in January 1982 because of its association with
 terrorist actions in northeastern India.
 Trade unions may organize, negotiate, and strike with relative
 freedom in India. Freedom to form associations and unions is
 guaranteed in the Constitution. The great majority of local
 unions are affiliated with national trade union centers which
 have links with the political parties of India. There are some
 restrictions on strike activity in industries which the
 government considers essential. The 1981 National Security Act
 can be invoked by the Government against strikes that "threaten
 the public order." The Essential Services Maintenance Act,
 passed by the Parliament in the fall of 1981, allows the
 Government to intervene to stop strikes and to mediate a
 solution to the unions' grievances.
 A one-day nationwide strike was called for January 19, 1982 by
 eight trade union centers, the trade union wings of all major
 opposition parties, primarily to protest the above two acts.
 Although the Government did not deny the unions' right to carry
 out such a strike, it denounced the strikes as
 politically-motivated. Over 6,000 persons were arrested under
 provisions of the National Security Act during the two days
 preceding the strike, and a total of 25,000 had reportedly been
 arrested by the time the strike was over. Nearly all detainees
 were released shortly after the strike. In another instance,
 3,000 persons were arrested on the eve of an April 19 one-day
 strike in Maharashtra. Nearly all, of those detained were
 released as soon as the strike ended.
 Labor legislation provides for a distinction between legal and
 illegal strikes. Although this legislation gives some
 government control over strikes, it is noteworthy that a year-
 old "illegal" strike involving 250,000 workers in the Bombay
 textile industry is still in effect. Because most unions are
 affiliated with political parties, the opportunity exists for
 the Government to favor those unions friendly to it and to be
 less forthcoming with opposition unions.
 The trade union movement is located almost entirely in the
 modern industrial economy. Organized workers, numbering 8 to
 10 million, are a small minority of the total labor force of
 about 268 million. Probably about 20 to 25 percent of the
 workers in the modern industrial sector are unionized.
 Unions and professional bodies are free to maintain contact
 with international bodies. The Indian National Trade Union
 Congress (Congress-I oriented) and the Hind Mazdoor Sabha are
 affiliated with the International Confederation of Free trade
 Unions. The pro-Moscow Communist Party of India trade union
 wing, the All-India Trade Union Congress, is affiliated with
 the World Federation of Trade Unions. The Center of Indian
 Trade Unions oriented toward the Independent Communist Party,
 Marxist, has no international affiliation although it has sent
 observers to the World Federation of Trade Unions meetings. A
 number of Indian industrial federations are affiliated with
 democratic international trade secretariats.
 There has been considerable concern in India over the
 persistence of a system of bonded labor. Although the practice
 is proscribed by law, in 1982 authorities in eleven states
 
 
 1132
 
 reported the existence of illegal contract labor schemes which
 exploited landless migrant laborers. The central Government,
 state authorities, and the Supreme Court have all investigated
 the illegal practices, and programs have been instituted for
 the rehabilitation of banded laborers. In Indian fiscal year
 1981-82, the central government spent the equivalent of
 approximately $2 million dollars on matching grants to state
 goverments. Private human rights organizations and trade
 unions are also active in the field. However, the large
 surplus supply of labor makes the system of bonded labor
 difficult for the Government to control.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Under the Indian Constitution, India is a secular state in
 which all religious groups are allowed to worship freely.
 While communal tensions based on different religious
 affiliations occur frequently and may lead to local injustice,
 the weight of government policy and practice does not favor one
 religious community over another.
 During 1982 some members of the Sikh minority charged the
 central government with a pattern of anti-Sikh discrimination.
 They alleged Government failure to abide by agreements
 benefiting the Sikh majority state of Punjab, diversion of
 Sikh-generated savings and resources to other states and
 groups, discrimination in military recruitment, and a general
 disregard for Sikh religious sensitivities. Some Sikhs have
 sought political asylum abroad claiming religious persecution,
 and demonstrations have occurred in the Punjab in 1982 to
 protest alleged anti-Sikh discrimination. While recognizing
 the emotional feelings involved, outside observers find little
 evidence of conscious anti-Sikh policies on the part of the
 central Government and no evidence that Sikhs are persecuted
 for their faith.
 The demands by the Akali Dal, a political party representing
 the interests of the Sikh community, are in nature more
 political than religious. The political demand for an
 autonomous Sikh homeland has generated considerable violence,
 including two hijackings of Indian commercial aircraft in
 August. Government mediators in October 1982 were prepared to
 accept certain predominately religious demands such as the
 declaration of Amritsar as a holy city and permission for Sikh
 religious broadcasts from the Sikh Golden Temple headquarters
 in Amritsar.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Since Indian independence in 1947, millions of refugees from
 neighboring countries have been admitted into India. These
 include Hindus and Sikhs from Pakistan, Tibetans from China,
 and Bengali Hindus and Muslims from present-day Bangladesh.
 The great majority of those refugees who wanted to remain have
 been granted Indian citizenship and integrated into the society
 and economy. As such, they are no longer officially regarded
 as refugees and data on their numbers are not available. A
 major exception is Assam, where massive Bangladeshi entry over
 the past 20 years (estimated at 1.2 million people) has
 produced an Assamese ethnic reaction and an "anti-foreigner"
 agitation movement paralyzing the state off and on over the
 past three years. Tibetans form a more distinct ethnic and
 
 
 1133
 
 religious group and tend to be concentrated in a few areas. In
 1982, they are numbered officially at 64,562. There is no
 evidence of forcible repatriation of any of these groups of
 refugees. For its part, the Indian Government has accepted in
 the past the repatriation of many thousands of people of Indian
 origin from Burma (209,000) and Sri Lanka (393,000) and lesser
 numbers from Uganda and other countries in East Africa, where
 they were either stateless persons or persons who had retained
 Indian nationality. Ethnic Indians who hold other countries'
 nationality are considered to have no special right of
 repatriation to India. There is no evidence of mass refugee
 flight from India since the Muslim exodus in 1947-1948.
 There is full freedom of movement within India for all
 citizens, except for a long-standing requirement to obtain
 permits to enter sensitive border areas. Foreign travel and
 emigration are without political restrictions. There are no
 special restrictions on internal or external travel,
 emigration, or repatriation which are applied to women or other
 groups.
 e.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 India is a functioning multi-party democracy grounded on
 universal suffrage for adult male and female citizens over 21.
 Citizens have a variety of opportunities and avenues through
 which to participate in the political process. These include
 periodic elections at the village (or panchayat) level,
 municipal and state assembly polls, and national parliamentary
 elections. State Assembly elections were held in four states
 in May, 1982, along with a number of by-elections.
 Elections in India are free and impartially administered. A
 multitude of local, state, and national parties are in active
 opposition to the Congress(I) Party presently in national
 office and holding power in 15 of India's 22 states. These
 parties freely contest elections at all levels. Opposition
 parties of every ideology are represented in the state
 assemblies and in the national.parliament. No groups in India,
 whether social, religious, or linguistic, are denied political
 participation or suffrage. They are free to organize, agitate,
 publish, and recruit, and to seek judicial redress in the event
 of perceived injustice. There are no problems of citizenship
 or nationality which impede political participation aside from
 Assam, where the matter of voters rolls, citizenship and hence
 political participation through elections is under negotiation
 between the leaders of the Assamese 'anti-foreigner" movement
 and the Government of India. The number of non-nationals
 residing in India is extremely small.
 Although there are no barriers to women candidates, their
 numbers have remained small through seven general elections.
 The present Prime Minister of India is a woman, and there are
 29 women members of the Lower House of Parliament (Lok Sabha)
 out of 530 (excluding Vacancies), and 25 in the Upper House
 (Rajya Sabha) of a total membership of 240 (also excluding
 vacancies).
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights.
 No international investigations of the human rights situation
 in India are known to have occurred since 1978. India is a
 member of UN bodies such as the Human Rights Commission. There
 
 
 1134
 are several private human rights monitoring organizations in
 India. Perhaps the most prominent is the People's Union for
 Civil Liberties based in New Delhi with chapters in several
 states and cities. Recently it split into two groups known as
 the People's Union for Civil Liberties and People's Union of
 Democratic Rights. These organizations periodically send study
 teams to assess and report on specific situations. For
 example, a Civil Liberties team investigated reports of police
 brutality in Tamil Nadu in May 1982. There are also a few
 women's groups which monitor the status of women.
 The most significant channels for reporting human rights
 violations are Parliament and the press. The latter has become
 increasingly active in its coverage of unjust social practices
 and exploitative economic relationships. It has been the main
 channel for focusing public and political attention on attacks
 in rural areas on low caste or Harijan people (untouchables),
 on violence against women, including rape, on injustices
 perpetrated against tribal people, and on exploited labor. The
 press has also taken the lead in some instances in examining
 the functioning of the preventive detention ordinances, jail
 conditions, and the problem of those awaiting trial.
 Among international, non-governmental organizations, Amnesty
 International's 1982 report listed that organization's concerns
 as "the use of preventive detention to detain critics of the
 government, reports of police brutality, torture and deaths in
 custody, and continued killings in various Indian states of
 political activists in 'encounters' with the police." Freedom
 House, in its 1982 report, classified India as "free."
 4. Economici Social, and Cultural Situation
 The Indian Constitution enjoins the Indian Government to
 "endeavor to minimize inequalities in income.. .and in status,
 facilities, and opportunities" for all citizens of India.
 Among these the Constitution lists "the right to work, to
 education, to public assistance, to secure a living wage.. .and
 a decent standard of life." Indian development and general
 economic policies emerged out of a series of five-year plans,
 the first beginning in 1950. India has a mixed economy in
 which key industries are vested in the public sector.
 Agricultural production is entirely private, while many
 important industries and most retailing are also in private
 hands. Eighty percent of the gross national product is
 produced by the private sector and 93 percent of employment is
 in the private sector.
 The extent of human needs in India that are still to be met for
 a population now numbering 700 million is shown by a few
 statistical examples. Life expectancy at birth is 51.8 years,
 and the infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births is 125.
 The population growth rate is 2.2 percent. Adult literacy is
 36 percent. The percentage of population with access to safe
 water is 33 percent, and the average number of persons housed
 per room is 4.8 in the urban areas and 5.3 in the rural areas.
 In each of these categories, however, there has been
 improvement in the past ten years.
 India's relatively poor growth performance has been a major
 contributor to the persistence of poverty. Between 1950-51 and
 1977-78, overall income growth averaged only 3.6 percent per
 year. Per capita income grew by 1.5 percent and still stands
 
 
 1135
 at only $190 (1980). An estimated 50.7 percent of the rural
 population and 40.3 percent of the urban population is below
 the level of absolute poverty. The ratio of calorie supply
 available for consumption relative to nutritional requirements
 is 91 percent (1977). The great physical, economic, and
 climatic diversity of the Indian sub-continent contributes to a
 differential regional incidence of poverty.
 In addition to social and economic tensions resulting from
 India's caste system in general, scheduled castes (the
 so-called untouchables or harijans), and tribal peoples pose a
 special problem. The scheduled castes comprise an estimated 15
 percent of the population. Scheduled tribes are seven percent.
 Government efforts to improve the position of the scheduled
 castes and tribes since independence have so far met only
 modest success. Despite government attempts to provide legal
 and physical protection, violence against scheduled castes in
 rural areas was widely reported in the Indian press in 1982.
 Much of this violence is instigated by groups from peasant
 castes which feel threatened by harijan demands for legal
 minimum wages or tenancy of allotted lands. Tribal groups and
 harijans continue to constitute a large proportion of India's
 "poorest of the poor," and the inequality of treatment or
 opportunities available to these groups constitutes a major
 impediment to India's economic as well as social and political
 development.
 In the field of health services there are great differences
 between urban and rural areas in all regions of the country.
 The rural crude death rate exceeds the urban rate by 42
 percent, and the rural infant mortality rate exceeds the urban
 rate by 43 percent. Differential access to health, family
 planning, and nutritional services has been a serious barrier
 to reducing mortality and fertility in rural areas and
 particularly among the poor.
 A striking feature in India is the steady decline of the ratio
 of women to men over many decades, a trend which is likely to
 continue into the next century. This is attributed both to
 women dying at a faster rate than men (a phenomenon so far not
 fully understood) and to a higher infant female mortality rate.
 This in turn relects the greater economic value associated with
 male children, especially in Northern India, and the consequent
 nutritional neglect of female infants.
 Although the Indian Constitution and subsequent laws grant
 equal status to men and women, in practice, a substantial gap
 remains to be bridged. While educational Opportunities are
 afforded without sex discrimination, career choice and
 advancement are heavily influenced by longstanding cultural
 biases regarding the role of women. Related to the status of
 women is the phenomena of "dowry deaths." In 1982, the Indian
 Parliament and press focused on the apparent increase in
 deaths, under suspicious circumstances, of recently-married
 women whose families were unable to provide the dowry expected
 by the family of the husband.
 The Indian educational system has expanded rapidly since
 independence. Primary school enrollments increased from 43
 percent to 80 percent of the relevant age groups between
 1950-51 and 1979-80, while literacy rose from 19 percent to 36
 percent over the same period. School enrollment figures are
 much higher for males than for females. Enrollments tend to be
 lower for children of disadvantaged groups, such as landless
 laborers and scheduled castes and tribes.
