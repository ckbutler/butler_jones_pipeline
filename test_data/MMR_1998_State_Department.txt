 BURMA
 Burma continued to be ruled by a highly authoritarian military regime. The mili-
 tary Government known as the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC)
 seized power in September 1988 after harshly suppressing massive prodemocracy
 demonstrations. In November 1997, the SLORC announced that the military Gov-
 ernment had renamed itself the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). The
 regime is headed by armed forces commander General Than Shwe and composed of
 top military officers. Retired dictator General Ne Win, whose idiosyncratic policies
 had isolated the country and driven it into deep economic decline, may continue to
 wield considerable influence. The SLORC permitted a relatively free election in
 1990, but it failed to honor the results--which were an overwhelming rejection of
 military rule-and cede power to the victorious prodemocracy forces. Instead, the
 SLORC attacked the coalition of winning parties and their leaders through intimi-
 dation, detention, and house arrest, and redoubled efforts to consolidate and perpet-
 uate its rule. In 1993 the SLORC established the "National Convention," a body os-
 tensibly tasked with drafting a new constitution. The SLORO carefllly handpicked
 the delegates and stage-managed the constitutional convention's proceedings, ignor-
 ing even limited opposition views. Although the National Convention has not been
 reconvened since 1996, the military government appears determined to draft a con-
 stitution that would ensure a dominant role for the military services in the country's
 future political structure. In August the principal democratic opposition party, the
 National League for Democracy (NLD), winner of the 1990 election, sought to expe-
 dite the transition to democracy by convening a parliament based on the election
 results. The SPDC responded by detaining 200 opposition NLD Members of Par-
 liament-elect, along with hundreds of other democracy supporters; most remain in
 detention. There are more than 1,000 political prisoners. This action was taken to
 preempt any challenge to the perpetual military domination of the nation's political
 life. The judiciary is not independent of the executive.
 The Government reinforces its firm military rule with a pervasive security appa-
 ratus led by the military intelligence organization, the Directorate of Defense Serv-
 ices Intelligence (DDSI). Control is buttressed by arbitrary restrictions on citizens'
 contacts with foreigners, surveillance of government employees and private citizens,
 harassment of political activists, intimidation, arrest, detention, and physical abuse.
 The Government justifies its security measures as necessary to maintain order and
 national unity. However, most major insurgent groups have reached individual ac-
 commodations with the SLORC/SPDC in recent years, which provide varying levels
 of stability and autonomy from central government control. Members of the security
 forces committed numerous, serious human rights abuses.
 Burma is a poor country with an estimated average per capita income of about
 $400, but about $800 on a purchasing power parity basis. More than three decades
 of military rule and mismanagement have resulted in widespread poverty. Primarily
 an agricultural country, Burma also has substantial mineral, fishing, and timber re-
 
 
 813
 sources. From 1988 to 1995, the Government partly liberalized and opened the econ-
 omy to permit expansion of the small private sector and attract foreign investment.
 This led to some economic growth, but major policy and systemic obstacles to eco-
 nomic reform persist. These include extensive overt and covert state involvement in
 economic activity, state monopolization of leading exports, a bloated bureaucracy,
 arbitrary and opaque governance, corruption, poor human and physical infrastruc-
 ture, and disproportionately large military spending at the expense of social devel-
 opment spending and stable prices. The difficulty of doing business in the country
 and international sanctions have discouraged potential investors.
 The Government's longstanding severe repression of human rights continued dur-
 ing the year. Citizens continued to live subject at any time and without appeal to
 the arbitrary and sometimes brutal dictates of the military dictatorship. Citizens do
 not have the right to change their government. The SPDC has given no sign of a
 willingness to cede its hold on absolute power. There continue to be credible reports,
 particularly in ethnic minority-dominated areas, that soldiers committed serious
 human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings and rape. Disappearances con-
 tinued, and members of the security forces beat and otherwise abused detainees.
 Prison conditions are harsh and life threatening. Arbitrary arrests and detentions
 for expression of dissenting political views continued with increasing frequency in
 an effort to intimidate the populace into submission in the face of deepening eco-
 nomic and political instability. More than 1,000 political prisoners remained in gov-
 ernment custody, including the approximately 200 parliamentarians elected in 1990
 detained since September. Since May 1996, at least 1,000 persons have been ar-
 rested, detained, or imprisoned for political reasons. The judiciary is subject to exec-
 utive influence. During the year, foreign tourists, businessmen and those suspected
 of or charged with political actions were subjected to increased surveillance, harass-
 ment, deportation, and in a few cases imprisonment.
 The SPDC maintained and intensified its restrictions on basic rights of free
 speech, press, assembly, and association. Political party activity remained severely
 restricted. Although the authorities recognize the NLD as a legal entity, they pre-
 vented the party from conducting normal political activities. The Government pres-
 sured many party offices throughout the country to close and refused to recognize
 the legal political status of key NLD party leaders, its General Secretary and 1991
 Nobel Laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, and the two party cochairmen, and it severely
 constrained their activities through security measures and threats. The regime de-
 tained more than 900 Members of Parliament-elect and NLD supporters to prevent
 the party from convening the parliament that was elected in 1990. It also tightened
 progressively the restrictions that it imposed in late 1996 on Aung San Suu Kyi's
 freedom to leave her Rangoon compound and her ability to receive visitors. On four
 occasions, the SPDC prevented Aung San Suu Kyi from leaving Rangoon, which
 prompted confrontations that lasted several days. While two of the standoffs were
 resolved through negotiation, on one occasion security forces forced-Aung San Suu
 Kyi to-return to Rangoon. On another occasion Aung San Suu Kyi returned volun-
 tarily, but only after her health had deteriorated dangerously when soldiers blocked
 her vehicle on a road for nearly 2 weeks to prevent herfrom peacefully visiting fam-
 ilies of her detained supporters.
 The Government imposes restrictions on certain religious minorities, and restricts
 freedom of movement. Thousands of citizens fled army attacks against insurgents,
 and remained in refugee camps in Thailand at year's end. Societal discrimination
 and violence against women, trafficking in women and girls, and widespread adult
 and child prostitution are severe problems. Some discrimination against women, and
 severe discrimination against religious and ethnic and minorities are common. The
 Government restricts-worker rights, bans unions, and uses forced labor for public
 works and to produce -food and other daily inecessities for military garrisons. The
 forced use of citizens as porters by the army-with attendant mistreatment, illness,
 and sometimes death-remained a- common practice. The Government did not en-
 force its 1995 military directive and repeated promise to cease the practice of forced
 civilian labor. Forced civilian labor remains widespread. The pervasive use of forced
 unpaid civilian labor on major infrastructure projects decreased slightly, as soldiers
 were used to supplement "contributed" labor by civilians. Child labor is also a prob-
 lem, stemming from poverty and lack of adequate access to education.
 During the SPDC's antiinsurgency operations, members of the military forces
 were responsible for arbitrary killings, rape, village relocations, the destruction of
 homes and property, and forced labor inflicted on ethnic minorities.
 -Insurgent forces committed numerous abuses, including killings, rapes, forced
 labor, the forced use of civilians as porters, and other atrocities.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Klling.-There continued to be many credible
 reports of brutality and the killing of civilians by soldiers, particularly in areas
 dominated by ethnic minorities, despite intermittent cease-fires that interrupted the
 longstanding insurencies in these areas (See Section 1.g.). Brutal treatment by sol-
 diers also caused deaths among those impressed as military porters in areas held
 by ethnic insurgents. The worst abuses occurred in areas that essentially have been
 zones of armed conflict for decades. According to unconfirmed reports, porters who
 no longer can work often are either abandoned without medical care or assistance,
 or executed (see Section 6.c.). The Government's general disregard for human rights
 has created a climate that is clearly conducive to such abuses.
 The military forces disregard the safety of noncombatants and target civilians sus-
 pected of supporting insurgents. Thousands of refugees continue to flee into neigh-
 boring Thailand (see Section 2.d.).
 Some inmates died in prisons due to the denial of adequate medical care and
 harsh conditions (see Section 1.c.). NLD detainee U Aung Min died in detention (see
 Section l.d.).
 Various insurgent groups also committed extrajudicial killings.
 In March soldiers, probably Democratic Karen Burmese Army (DKBA) forces,
 shelled the Wang Ka camp for displaced Burmese Karen located in Thailand. They
 killed two persons and wounded dozens more. The troops set fire to nearly all the
 huts in the camp, leaving thousands of persons homeless before the soldiers-re-
 turned to Burma (see Sections 1.g. and 2.d.).
 b. Disappearance.-As in previous years, private citizens and political activists
 continued to "disappear" temporarily, for periods ranging from several hours to sev-
 eral weeks. DDSI officials usually apprehended individuals for questioning without
 the knowledge of their family members, sometimes seizing .them in the streets. In
 many, although not all cases, DDSI released them soon afterward. Such action usu-
 ally was intended to prevent free political expression or assembly. The military serv-
 ices continued to seize by force large numbers of persons for porterage or related
 duties, often without the knowledge of their family members. The whereabouts of
 those conscripted, as well as of prisoners transferred for labor or porterage duties,
 remain unknown for extensive periods.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The authorities routinely subjected detainees to harsh interrogation techniques de-
 signed to intimidate and disorient. The most common forms of mistreatment were
 sleep and food deprivation coupled with around-the-clock questioning; some detain-
 ees also were kicked and beaten. Credible reports continue that prisoners are forced
 to squat or assume stressful, uncomfortable, or painful positions for lengthy periods.
 There continued to be credible reports that security forces subjected ordinary citi-
 zens to harassment and physical abuse. The military forces routinely confiscated
 property, cash, and food, and used coercive and abusive recruitment methods to pro-
 cure porters. Those forced into porterage or other duties faced extremely difficult
 conditions and beatings and mistreatment that sometimes resulted in death (see
 Sections l.a. and 6.c.). In June security forces beat NLD members (see Section 2.b.).
 There were frequent reports that soldiers raped women who were members of eth-
 nic minorities, especially in Shan, Karenni, and Karen states, where the majority
 of armed encounters between the army and insurgents took place (see Section 1.g.).
 Insurgent forces also raped civilians.
 Prison conditions are harsh and life threatening. The extremely harsh prison regi-
 men includes the lack of opportunity for exercise, mosquito nets and reading mate-
 rials for some prisoners, poor nutrition, inadequate media care, and the use of soli-
 tary confinement and "dog cells," (small enclosures that remind citizens of kennels
 used during World War II) as punishment. A number of prominent political pris-
 oners were housed in separate bungalow accommodations on the prison compound.
 All prisoners usually were permitted to receive medicine as well as essential supple-
 mental food brought by their families (if the families could afford to do so) during
 15-minute visits permitted every 2 weeks, although there are occasional reports that
 guards demand bribes for that privilege. Authorities transferred many detainees
 and prisoners from their home towns to distant prisons, making family visits very
 difficult.
 tConditions, for political prisoners were reported to be much harsher at some
 p count locations such as the Thayet    Thayawaddy prisons ted oRangoon.
 Throughout the year, the authorities transferred many prisoners-including NLD
 members-from Insein Prison in Rangoon to upcountry prisons. The inevitable con-
 sequence for most prisoners of these transfers was additional hardship, in the form
 
 
 815
 of reduced access to family support, food, medicine, and clothing. There were reports
 that prison conditions for a number of political prisoners improved late in the year,
 including for some prominent political prisoners who have remained in hospital
 wards under guard rather than in prisons (see Section i.e.). There were credible re-
 ports that at least a few poitical prisoners or detainees were denied adequate medi-
 cal care. Some of theseprisoners died in detention as a result. On August 7, Mem-
 ber of Parliament-elect U Than Win died while serving an 11-year sentence.
 The Government does not permit prison visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Fxile.-There is no provision in the law for judi-
 cial determination of the legality of detention, and the SPDO routinely practiced ar-
 bitrary arrest and incommunicado detention. Prior to being charged, detainees rare-
 ly had access to legal counsel or their families and poitical detainees have no oppor-
 tunity to obtain release on bail. Political detainees are held incommunicado for long
 periods. Even after being charged, detainees rarely have benefit of counsel.
 Private citizens and political activists continued to "disappear" temporarily at the
 hands of security forces (see Section 1.b.).
 The Government detained and deported foreign journalists (see Section 2.a.). The
 Government detained, convicted, and later deported 18 foreign activists (see Section
 i.e.).
 The authorities carried out a campaign of detention and intimidation from May
 through December to prevent the NLD from convening the parliament elected in
 1990. Prior to the NLD's planned convening of parliament, the SPDC detained 203
 NLD Members of Parliament-Elect and 700 activists throughout the country to pre-
 vent them from attending the event in Rangoon. These detentions violated the
 NLD's right as a legal party to hold a political gathering (see Section 2.b.).
 By year's end, the authorities released about 20 percent of these detainees, many
 for reasons of illness or infirmity. On October 21, one NLD detainee, 52-year-old U
 Aung Min, died in detention during what the Government described as "exchanges
 of views." The Government attributed his death to a fast spreading cancer; it did
 not release an autopsy report.
 The military forces forcibly seized citizens to serve as porters during military op-
 erations; soldiers inflicted brutal treatment on such persons, at time causing their
 deaths (see Sections 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c.).
 Forced exile is not used as a method of political control. However, during the year,
 Aung San Suu Kyi repeatedly was threatened with deportation or internal exile in
 the state-controlled media.
 In 1990, when the SPDC refused to recognize the results of the elections and pres-
 sured successful candidates to resign, some candidates, as well as thousands of po-
 litical activists, went into foreign exile rather than face threats.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is not independent of the executive.
 The SPDC appoints justices to the Supreme Court who, in turn, appoint lower court
 judges with the approval of the SPDC. Pervasive corruption further serves to under-
 mine the impartiality of the justice system.
 The court system, as inherited from the United Kingdom and subsequently re-
 structured, comprises courts at the township, district, state, and national levels.
 Throughout the year, the Government continued to rule by decree and was not
 bound by any constitutional provisions providing for fair public trials or any other
 rights. Although remnants of the British-era legal system were formally in place,
 the court system and its operation remained seriously flawed, particularly in the
 handling of political cases. Unprofessional behavior by some court officials, the mis-
 use of overly broad laws, and the manipulation of the courts for political ends con-
 tinued to deprive citizens of the right to a fair trial and the rule of law.
 Some basic due process rights, including the right to a public trial and to be rep-
 resented by a defense attorney, generally were respected, except in political cases
 that authorities deemed especially sensitive. Defense attorneys are permitted to call
 and cross-examine witnesses, but their primary purpose is to bargain with the judge
 to obtain the shortest possible sentence for their clients. Most court proceedings are
 open to the public. However, in political cases, trials are held in courtrooms on pris-
 on compounds and are not open to the public. In these instances, defense counsel
 appears to serve no purpose other than to provide moral support, since reliable re-
 ports indicate that verdicts are dictated by higher authorities. In a notable excep-
 tion, U Aung Thein's trial in June was held in a quasi-open court in order to embar-
 rass the NLD by trying to pit an NLD supporter against an NLD leader. Judicial
 authorities permitted only his attorney, family, and witnesses to be present; the
 public was excluded.
 In August police detained a group of 18 foreign activists for allegedly distributing
 antigovernment leaflets; they were charged, tried without benefit of an attorney,
 convicted, and sentenced to 5 years in prison. However, the foreign activists were
 
 
 deported later that day. The Government granted consular access to these individ-
 uals, although in other cases, it denied such access.
 In December 1997, the SPDC commuted the sentences of those prisoners who
 were serving terms longer than 10 years. The SPDC reduced the sentences of ap-
 proximately 60 students and political prisoners who were arrested between 1988
 and 1992, making them eligible for release within the next few years. However,
 some political prisoners remain in custody after the completion of their original sen-
 tence. NLD members U Aung Thein and U Ha Myint were sentenced to 14 years
 in prison in June for having disclosed to journalists the contents of a letter from
 an ethnic insurgent cease-fire group to an SPDC member.
 There are unconfirmed estimates that the Government holds over 1,000 political
 prisoners.
 f, Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 military authorities ruled unchecked by any independent state organ, and the State
 continued to interfere extensively and arbitrarily in the lives of private citizens.
 Through its extensive intelligence network and administrative procedures, the Gov-
 ernment closely monitored the travel and activities of many citizens, particularly
 those known to be politically active. Authorities sometimes enter homes during
 night hours to examine registration documents of occupants as a form of monitoring
 personal movements. Security personnel attempted to screen all private correspond-
 ence and telephone calls and searched private premises and other property without
 warrants. Citizens generally were unable to subscribe directly to foreign publica-
 tions (see Section 2.a.). Government employees generally are required to obtain ad-
 vance permission before meeting with foreigners.
 Communication devices are rationed or licensed to limit citizens' access to infor-
 mation. Internet communication is highly restricted. Possession of an unregistered
 telephone, facsimile machine, or computer modem has resulted in prison sentences.
 Government employees are prohibited from joining or supporting political parties.
 The military services forced citizens-including women and children-to work as
 military porters under harsh conditions (see Sections 1.a, 1.b., 1.g., and 6.c.). The
 army reportedly includes child soldiers as young as 14 years old. Youth soldiers are
 assigned support duties; both the Government and insurgents used forced conscrip-
 tion near military camps.
 To make way for commercial or public construction, and in some cases for security
 reasons, the SPDC continued to relocate citizens out of cities to new towns, although
 on a much smaller scale than during the early 1990's. While facilities in these areas
 have improved over time, residents targeted for displacement continued to be given
 no option but to move, usually on short notice. The military authorities also contin-
 ued the widespread and frequent practice of forcible relocation of rural villages, in-
 cluding their residents, in ethnic minority areas in response to security concerns.
 This practice, again this year as in 1997, was particularly widespread and egregious
 in the Shan, Kayah, and Karen states as part of the armed forces campalgn against
 insurgents. In these states, thousands of villagers were displaced and herded into
 smaller settlements in strategic areas (see Section 1.g.).
 In a number of urban areas, residents were compelled to cede land for road widen-
 ing and a host of other projects approved without any public consultation or en-
 dorsement. Other long-term city residents were required to cede land for commercial
 redevelopment and were compensated at only a fraction of the value of their lost
 homes. In a Muslim village near Moulmein, authorities forced villagers off the land
 in January in order to build a government facility. Villagers complained that the
 Government's compensation was inadequate. In urban Rangoon, previously con-
 fiscated land was developed into high-density housing that previously evicted ten-
 ants could purchase only at prices beyond the means of many. In rural areas, mili-
 tary personnel at times confiscated livestock, fuel, and food supplies. In July the At-
 torney General banned women from marrying foreigners. This ban is not consist-
 ently enforced.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-For 50 years, the army has battled diverse ethnic insurgencies. These ethnic
 minority insurgent groups have sought to gain greater autonomy, or in some cases,
 -independence from the dominant ethnic Burman majority. In 1989 the SPDC began
 a policy of seeking cease-fire agreements with most ethnic insurgent groups along
 the borders.
 Following the breakdown of its cease-fire with the separatist Karenni National
 Progressive Party (KNPP) in 1995, the army began an offensive in 1996 against the
 KNPP that continued through year's end. As part of its campaign to deny the guer-
 rillas local support, the military forces forcibly relocated hundreds of villages and
 tens of thousands of Karenni civilians. In central and southern Shan state, the mili-
 tary forces continued to engage the Shan State Army (SSA), a remnant of Khun Sa's
 
 
 narcotics-linked former Mong Tai Army, and began a campaign of relocation against
 the villagers in the re    an  thousands were forcibly removed from their vil-
 lages. There are credible reports of retaliatory killings, rapes, and other atrocities
 committed by the army against civilians.
 The Karen National Union (KNU) is the largest single insurgent group that con-
 tinues to fight against central government rule. In 1997 cease-fire talks between the
 KNU and SLORC broke down and were followed by a the SLORC offensive that
 puhed the KNU out of its last strongholds in Karen state. As a result, over 20,000
 ~en civilians fled to Thailand. The Government denied responsibility for attacks
 on Karen refugee camps in Thailand that were carried out by the DKBA. However,
 according to credible reports, the DKBA receives military support from the Govern-
 ment.
 In conjunction with the military's campaigns against the Karen, Karenni, and
 Shan insurgents, it was standard practice for the Government's armed forces to co-
 erce civilians into working as porters in rural areas in or near combat zones. Accord-
 ing to testimony collected by international human rights nongovernmental organiza-
 tions (NGO's) from refugees, the men-and sometimes women and children as
 well-who were forced taor as porters often suffered beatings. On occasion, they
 died as a result of their mistreatment by soldiers (see Sections 1.a, 1.b., 1.c., and
 6.c.). There were reports that soldiers raped some female members of ethnic minori-
 ties in contested areas.
 In regions controlled by insurgents groups such as the Shan state, or in areas con-
 trolled y groups that have negotiated cease-fires with the Government such as the
 Wa territory, there are credible repor that these groups engaged in narcotics pro-
 duction and trafficking. In combat zones or in areas controlled by ethnic minorities,
 the insurgents subjected civilians to forced labor.
 Antigovernment insurgent groups were also responsible for violence, including de-
 ploying land mines and conducting ambushes that caused both civilian and military
 deaths. The SSA insurgents committed retaliatory killings, rapes, and other atroc-
 ities against civilians. There were credible reports that insurgents used women and
 children as porters. Karen National Union troops reportedly are led by child sol-
 diers.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of S eech and Press.-The Government continued to impose severe re-
 strictions on freedom of speech and of the press. The security services continued to
 harass and repress those attempting to express opposition political views, and many
 more refrained from speaking out due to fear of arrest, interrogation, and other
 forms of intimidation. Since late 1996, the authorities have prohibited the weekend
 gatherings in front of Aung San Suu Kyi's residence at which she and NLD vice-
 chairmen Tin Qo and Kyi Maung responded to letters from the public and delivered
 speeches.
 In September Aung San Suu Kyi began holding weekly meetings at NLD head-
 quarters. Those meetings continued through year's end, although government secu-
 rity forces were present. The Government enhanced the existing barriers that
 blocked access to her residence during the year, and severely restricted her freedom
 to leave her compound or to receive visitors.
 The government monopoly newspaper, television, and radio remained propaganda
 instruments. These official media normally did not report opposing views except to
 criticize them. Editors e arep oe reainedoanswerable to military authorities
 and reportedly were compelled to publish progovernment articles in nonofficial
 media. While the English language daily, New Light of Myanmar continued to in-
 clude many edited international -ire service reports on foreign news, domestic news
 hewed strictly to and reinforced government policy. Illegal copies of international
 news magazines were sold by street vendors.
 All forms of domestic public media were officially controlled or censored. This
 strict control in turn encouraged self-censorship on the part of writers and publish-
 ers. Citizens were generally unable to subscribe directly to foreign publications, but
 a limited selection of foreign newspapers could be purchased in a few hotels and
 stores in Rangoon (see Section 1.f.). A limited supply of international newsmaga-
 zines and a sizable number of private publications on nonpolitical problems were
 available to the public, but censors frequently banned issues or deleted articles
 deemed unwelcome by the Government.
 The Government issued few visas to journalists after April 1997 and held less
 than a handful of press conferences on topical subjects. Several journalists who en-
 tered the country as tourists were detained and deported by the authorities.
 Foreign radio broadcasts, such as those of the British Broadcasting Corporation,
 Voice of America, Radio Free Asia, and the Norway-based Democratic Voice of
 
 
 818
 Burma, remained the principal sources of uncensored information. The authorities
 continued to restrict the reception of radio and satellite television broadcasts, al-
 though restrictions are not enforced strictly in many cases. Penalties of up to 3
 years' imprisonment for operation of an unlicensed satellite television receiver can
 be imposed. Licenses were almost impossible to obtain by politically active citizens.
 Many citizens ignored the licensing regulation without penalty.
 *A series of totalitarian dcrees issued by the Government in 1996 designed to
 strengthen its control over all forms of political expression and citizens' access to
 information remained in force during the year. Order 5196 in 1996 prohibited
 speeches or statements that "undermine national stability" as well as the drafting
 of alternative constitutions. A 1996 amendment to the television and video law im-
 posed additional restrictions and stiffer penalties on the distribution of videotapes
 not approved by the censor. Also in 1996, the Government decreed that all comput-
 ers, software, and associated telecommunications devices would be subject to govern-
 ment registration. During the year, the Government began to offer Internet services
 to a small number of customers. At least two companies associated with the Govern-
 ment provide electronic mail service; however, Internet communications are re-
 stricted tightly.
 University teachers and professors remained subject to the same restrictions on
 freedom of speech, political activities, and publications as other government employ-
 ees. These included warnings against criticism of the Government; instructions not
 to discuss-politics while at work; strictures against joining or supporting political
 parties; engaging in political activity; or meeting foreigners. Government employees
 also are coerced into joining the military Government's mass mobilization organiza-
 tion, the Union Solidarity and Development Association (USDA). Teachers continued
 to be held responsible for propagating SPDC political goals among their students
 and for maintaining discipline and preventing students from engaging in any unau-
 thorized political activity.
 Following student demonstrations in December 1996, the Government closed the
 universities and even primary and secondary schools to prevent further demonstra-
 tions. Primary and secondary schools reopened in August 1997. After 2 years, sev-
 eral universities were opened for abbreviated refresher course and examinations for
 2 weeks in August. Dissatisfaction with the limited time for education prompted
 several student demonstrations. The authorities arrested student protest leaders,
 and universities held exams, only to be closed again within a few weeks. By Decem-
 ber the Government had reopened the Rangoon and Mandalay medical schools on
 a trial basis.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government restricts free-
 dom of assembly. Its prohibition of unauthorized outdoor assemblies of more than
 five persons remained in effect, although it was enforced unevenly. The 10 existing
 legal political parties remained required to request formal permission from the au-
 thorities to hold internal meetings of their members, although some members still
 met without official permission.
 In September 1997, the authorities reversed a position barring party meetings
 and allowed the NLD to celebrate the ninth anniversary of the party's founding, the
 largest gathering held by the NLD since 1990. In May the authorities also allowed
 the NLD to hold a 2-day party congress on the anniversary of the 1990 elections.
 The authorities also permitted several public gatherings of NLD members and sup-
 porters on various holidays with little or no interference. The authorities allowed
 holiday celebrations to take place in Aung San Suu Kyi's compound, but police re-
 stricted the size of the gatherings, and their suspension of restrictions was sporadic.
 On June 25, security forces blocked NLD members from entering Aung San Suu
 Kyi's compound and beat them, slightly injuring some. Riot police prevented student
 demonstrations on August 24 by charging them with batons. There were no injunies.
 The USDA continued to hold large-scale rallies in support of government policies.
 In September and October, large anti-NLD rallies were organized by the Govern-
 ment in every state and division. Participants were required to attend. There were
 no reported incidents in which the authorities interfered with religious groups' as-
 semblies or other outdoor gatherings during the year.
 The Government restricts freedom of association. Aside from officially sanctioned
 organizations like the USDA, the right of association existed only for organizations,
 including trade associations and professional bodies, permitted by law and duly reg-
 istered with the Government, such as the Mymar Women's Entrepreneur Associa-
 tion. Only a few continue to exist, and even those are subject to direct government
 intervention and take special care to act in accordance with government policy. This
 group inciudes apolitical organizations such as the Myamar Red Cross and the
 Myanmar Medical Association. Only 10 political parties remain legally in existence
 and most are moribund.
 
 
 819
 The SPDC's repression of the NLD continued; it harassed NLD members for petty
 offenses, and arrested and convicted NLD supporters for political crimes, especially
 those personally associated with NLD General Secretary Aung San Suu Kyi.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Adherents of all religions duly registered with the au-
 thorities generally enjoyed freedom to worship as they chose; however, the Govern-
 ment imposed some restrictions on certain religious minorities. In recent years,
 Buddhists continued to enjoy a privileged position. In some areas members of other
 religious minorities reportedly were forced by the Government to help construct pa-
 godas. The Government has made special efforts to link itself with Buddhism as a
 means of asserting its own popular legitimacy. Photographs of SPDC officials paying
 homage or making donations at pagodas throughout the country appear regularly
 in the official newspaper. Aung San Suu Kyi was able to visit religious sites in Ran-
 goon several times during the year.
 The Government monitored the activities of members of all religions, including
 Buddhism, in part because congregation members have in the past become politi-
 cally active. The authorities continued to regard the Muslim and Christian religious
 minorities with suspicion. Moreover, there is a concentration of Christians among
 some of the ethnic minorities against whom the army has fought for decades. Reli-
 gious publications, like secular ones, remained subject to control and censorship.
 Christian bibles and Muslim Korans translated into indigenous languages could not
 be imported legally, although this ban is not enforced in some areas. It remained
 difficult for Christian and Muslim groups to obtain permission to build new church-
 es and mosques.
 Religious groups of all faiths were able to establish and maintain links with core-
 ligionists in other countries and travel abroad for religious purposes; however, the
 Government reportedly monitored these activities. Foreign religious representatives
 usually were allowed visas only for short stays but in some cases were permitted
 to preach to congregations. Permanent foreign missionary establishments have not
 been permitted since the 1960's, but some elderly nuns and priests working in
 Burma since before independence in 1948 have been allowed to continue their work.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Although citizens have the legal right to live anywhere in the country,
 both urban and rural residents were subject to arbitrary relocation (see Section 1.f).
 Except for limitations in areas of insurgent activity, citizens could travel freely with-
 in the country but must notify local authorities of their whereabouts.
 The Government restricted the freedom of movement of NLD General Secretary
 Aung San Suu Kyi (see Section 2.a.). Aung San Suu Kyi attempted to leave Rangoon
 four times, beginning in July. Each time military authorities blocked her movement
 and in one instance forcibly returned her to the capital.
 Those residents unable to meet the restrictive provisions of the citizenship law,
 such as ethnic Chinese, Arakanese, Muslims, and others must obtain prior permis-
 sion to travel. The Government carefully scrutinized prospective travel abroad. This
 produced rampant corruption as many applicants were forced to pay large bribes to
 obtain passports to which they were otherwise entitled. The official board that re-
 viewspassport applications denied passports in some cases apparently on political
 grounds  All college graduates who obtained a passport (except for certain govern-
 ment employees) were required to pay a special education clearance fee to reimburse
 the Government for the cost of their education up to matriculation. Citizens who
 had emigrated legally generally were allowed to return to visit relatives, and some
 who had lived abroad illegally and acquired foreign citizenship were able to return
 to visit. The Government on occasion restricts the issuance of passports to female
 applicants under the age of 25 seeking work abroad, reportedly to prevent young
 women from being enticed to travel abroad to jobs that are in fact in the commercial
 sex industry.
 Restrictions on foreign travelers have been eased as part of an effort to promote
 tourism. Burmese embassies issued tourist visas, valid for 1 month, within 24 hours
 of application. However, select categories of applicants, such as foreign human
 rights advocates, journalists, and political figures continued to be denied entry visas
 unless traveling under the aegis of a sponsor acceptable to the Government, and for
 purposes approved by the Government. Many travelers were questioned at length
 and asked to sign oaths indicating that they were not part of these categories before
 their visas were issued. The authorities detained and deported several journalists
 (see Section 2.a.). One foreign citizen who entered the country illegally after pre-
 viously being expelled for antigovernment activity was sentenced to 5 years in pris-
 on. He was released after 90 days and deported. The Government arrested, con-
 victed, and later deported 18 foreign activists (see Section I.e.). Although some
 areas of the country remained closed to foreigners for security reasons, the authori-
 
 
 ties permitted travel to most other destinations. Rangoon-based diplomats must
 apply 10 days in advance for travel outside the capital.
 At year's end, there were still 21,000 Rohingya Muslims remaining in refugee
 camps in Bangladesh. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees'
 (UNHCR's) repatriation program, which since 1992 had succeeded in returning ap-
 proximately 238,000 refugees to Burma and had been scheduled to end on August
 15, 1997, halted prematurely when the Rohingyas as a group-rejected repatriation
 and-demanded resettlement in Bangladesh. While the Government agreed to resume
 repatriation of those remaining, this repatriation: has yet to commence. This repatri-
 ation is proceeding slowly.
 The Rohingyas refused to return because they feared human rights abuses, in-
 cluding religious persecution and other government restrictions. The UNHCR re-
 ported that authorities cooperated in investigating isolated incidents of renewed
 abuse of repatriated citizens. However, returnees complained of restrictions imposed
 by the Government on their ability to-travel and to engage in economic activity.
 A few thousand students and dissidents continued to live in exile in Thailand. The
 approximately 100,000 Burmese residing in refugee camps in Thailand in January
 were joined during the year by thousands of new arrivals fleeing army attacks
 against insurgencies in the Karen, Karenni, and Shan ethnic areas.
 The Government does not allow refugees or displaced persons from abroad to re-
 settle or seek safe haven. The Government has not formulated a policy concerning
 refugees, asylees, or first asylum. There were no reports of the forced return to a
 country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Despite the overwhelming desire that citizens demonstrated in the 1990 elections
 for a return to democracy, they continued to be denied the right to change their gov-
 ernment.
 Since 1962 active duty military officers have occupied most important positions
 throughout the Government, particularly at the policy making level, but also ex-
 tending to local administration. Despite the appointment of several civilians to the
 Cabinet in 1992, the military Government's policy of placing military or recently re-
 tired military officers in most key senior level positions in all ministries has contin-
 ued unabated. In the SPDC Government formed in November 1997, only 12 of the
 41 ministers appointed were civilians. The authorities thwarted all efforts to con-
 vene the Peoples' Parliament that was elected in 1990. The last civilian cabinet
 member, Foreign Minister U Aung Gyaw, was retired in November and replace with
 a diplomat, U Win Aung, who began his career in the military services.
 Following the NLD's victory in the 1990 elections, the SPDC nullified the election
 results and disqualified, detained, arrested, or drove into exile many successful can-
 didates. Since then, 280 of the 480 members of parliament-elect have been disquali-
 fied, resigned under pressure, gone into exile, been jailed, or died. A total of 43 suc-
 cessful candidates from the election remain in prison. More than 150 have been de-
 tained without charge in what the Government calls "exchanges of views."
 Rather than accept the will of the citizenry as expressed in the 1990 election, the
 SPDC (then known as the SLORC) convened a National Convention in 1993 to draw
 up principles for a new constitution. The SLORC hand-picked most delegates, and
 carefully stage-managed the proceedings; even limited opposition views were ig-
 nored. The SLORC tasked the Convention with drafting a new constitution designed
 to provide a dominant role for the military services in the country's future political
 structure. In 1995 the NLD delegates withdrew from the convention pending agree-
 ment by the authorities to discuss revising the Convention's working procedures to
 permit debate and meaningful participation in formulation of a new constitution.
 Two days after its withdrawal, the NLD was expelled formally. The National Con-
 vention continued its deliberations until it adjourned in March 1996. It has not re-
 convened. The provisions that it adopted were designed to ensure the large-scale in-
 volvement of the military services in all levels of government-including reserving
 25 percent of seats in the Parliament to appointed members of the military services,
 and reserving key government posts for military personnel as well. In addition it
 adopted provisions that prohibited, among other things, anyone "under acknowledg-
 ment of allegiance" to a foreigner or who has received any type of assistance from
 a foreign source, from particpating in the Government. These provisions apparentiy
 were designed to exclude Aung San Suu Kyi, who is married to a British subject.
 Women and minorities are underrepresented in the Government and the top
 ranks of government services and excluded from military leadership. There are no
 female members of the SPDC, ministers, or Supreme Courtjudges.
 
 
 821
 Members of certain minority groups continue to be denied full citizenship (see
 Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not allow domestic human rights organizations to exist, and
 it remained generally hostile to outside scrutiny of its human rights record. Approxi-
 mately 14 nonpolitical, humanitarian, international NGO's continued project work.
 A few others established a provisional presence while undertaking the protracted
 negotiations necessary to set up permanent operations in the country.
 Disturbed by the severe criticism contained in 1995 resolutions adopted by the
 U.N. Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) during the year, the authorities contin-
 ued to refuse to meet with UNHRC representatives. In his reports to the UNHRC,
 Special Rapporteur for Burma, Rajsoomer Lallah, who was repeatedly denied entry
 into the country, criticized the human rights violations committed against ethnic mi-
 norities as a result of the SPDC's policy of forcible relocations and continued re-
 course to forced labor, including citizens' forced labor as porters. The authorities al-
 lowed the visit of U.N. Special Envoy to Burma, Alvaro de Soto in January, who
 visited the country to discuss political issues. After many delays, de Soto was per-
 mitted to return to Burma in October.
 The Government denied entry to staff of the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) Special Commission of Inquiry into forced labor in Burma.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Government continued to rule by decree and was not bound by any constitu-
 tional provisions concerning discrimination.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women, including spousal abuse, appears to
 be relatively infrequent. Married couples ofen live in households with extended
 families, where social pressure tends to protect the wife from abuse. In June the
 Government's Social Welfare Training School organized a seminar to train school in-
 structrs to help protect women from violence. Trafficking in women and girls re-
 mains a serious problem.
 There were reliable reports that many women and children in border areas, where
 the Government's conl is liited, were forced or lured into working as prostitutes
 in Thailand. It is unknown how many young women have been induced or coerced
 into working as prostitutes, but a common practice is to lure young women to Thai-
 land with promises of employment as a waitress or domestic servant. The military
 forces continued to impress women for military porterage duties (see Sections 1.c.
 and 1.g.).
 In general women traditionally have enjoyed a high status, exercising most of the
 same basic rights as men and taking an active role in business. Consistent with tra-
 ditional culture, women keep their names after marriage and often control family
 finances. However, women remained underrepresented in most traditional male oc-
 cupations, and a few professions continued to be effectively barred to women. The
 burden of poverty, which is particularly widespread in rural areas, fell dispropor-
 tionately on women. The Government restricts foreign travel by young women (see
 Section 2.d.). In July the Attorney General banned women from marrying foreigners;
 however, the Government does not enforce this ban consistently in response to a
 high profile case in which false marriages were used to lure women into prostitution
 (see Section 1.f.).
 Women did not consistently receive equal pay for equal work. There were no inde-
 pendent women's rights organizations, and no government ministry was charged
 specifically with safeguarding women's interests. The Myanmar Maternal and Child
 Welfare Association, a government-controlled agency, provided assistance to moth-
 ers. A professional society for businesswomen, the Myanmar Women Entrepreneurs'
 Association, formed in 1995, provided loans to new businesses.
 Children.-Despite operating various child welfare programs, the Government al-
 located few resources to programs for children. According to government studies con-
 ducted with U.N. assistance, although education is compulsory, 65 to 75 percent of
 children do not finish primary school, and only 5 percent complete secondary school.
 Government budget allocations for education have declined steadily since 1990.
 Child prostitution of young females, especially those from the ethnic minority
 Shan state sent or lured to Thailand, continued to be a major problem.
 Government efforts to stop trafficking in young women are modest and ineffective.
 The Government makes it difficult to obtain passports or marry foreigners. Most
 citizens who are forced or lured into prostitution cross the border into Thailand
 without passports.
 
 
 "The rising incidence of HIV infection has increased the demand for supposedly
 "safer" younger prostitutes. The army conscripts children as young as the age of 14,
 especially orphans and street children; they are deployed to training camps where
 they support the military forces:n combat areas, children have been forced to serve
 as porters, where beatings and other mistreatment reportedly occur.,
 The military forces continue to force children to labor as porters, and often sub-
 jected them to beatings (see Sections 1.f and l.g.).
 Religious Minorities.-There are credible reports that Muslims in the western
 state of Rakhine were compelled by the Government to build Buddhist pagodas as
 part of the country's forced conscription labor program.
 People With Disabilities.-Official assistance to persons with disabilities is ex-
 tremely limited. There is no law mandating accessibility to buildlngs, public trans-
 portation, or government facilities. While there are several small-scale organizations
 to assist the disabled, most disabled persons must rely on their families to provide
 for their welfare. Disabled veterans receive available benefits on a priority basis. Be-
 cause of land mine detonations, Burma has a very high rate of amputee injuries.
 NationallRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-The country's myriad ethnic minorities have
 long resented the dominance of the country's Burman majority. The minorities have
 been largely excluded from the military leadership. In recent years, the SPDC has
 sought to pacify these ethnic groups by means of negotiated cease-fires, grants of
 limited autonomy, and promises of development assistance.
 The Government included a large number of ethnic minority representatives in
 the National Convention and permitted extended debate on the problem of minority
 autonomy. However, the ethnic minority populations continue to complain that their
 concerns have not been addressed adequately by the Government. Economic devel-
 opment among minorities has continued to lag, leaving-many persons living at or
 below subsistence levels.
 Since the focus of hostilities against armed insurgencies has been in the border
 areas where most minorities are concentrated, those populations have been victim-
 ized disproportionately by the general violence associated with the military forces'
 activities. Even in areas pacified under cease-fire arrangements, forced labor, village
 relocations, and other infringements on the rights of ethnic minorities continue to
 be imposed by local army and insurgent commanders.
 Since only persons who can prove long familial links to Burma are accorded full
 citizenship, ethnic populations, such as Muslims, Indians, and Chinese, continued
 to be denied full citizenship and are excluded from government positions. Persons
 without full citizenship face restrictions in domestic travel and are barred from cer-
 tain advanced university programs in medicine and technological fields (see Section
 2.d.). Wide-ranging governmental and societal discrimination against minorities per-
 sists. Ethnic minority languages are not taught in public schools. There are few mi-
 nority language publications. Ethnicity is indicated on some national identity cards.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right ofAssociation.-Free trade unions do'not exist, and even former gov-
 ernment-controlled ones were dormant. Strikes are rare; however, in December
 1997, workers in a foreign-owned textile factory in Pegu staged a successful 4-day
 strike. Following the intervention of the Department of Labor, workers and manage-
 ment reached a compromise that included higher wages and improved working con-
 ditions.
 Because of its longstanding violation of ILO Convention 87 on Freedom of Associa-
 tion, Burma was cited for continued failure to implement the convention by the
 -June 1998 ILO Conference. The Conference criticized the lack of progress and the
 absence of cooperation on the part of the Government.
 No unions are affiliated internationally.'
 In 1989 the United States suspended Burma's eligibility for trade concessions
 under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program, pending steps to af-
 ford its labor force internationally recognized worker rights.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers do not have the
 right to organize and bargain collectively to set wages and benefits. The Govern-
 ment's Central Arbitration Board, which theoretically provides a means for settling
 major labor disputes, continued to exist but in practice was dormant. Township-level
 labor supervisory committees exist to address minor labor concerns.
 The Government unilaterally sets wages in the public sector. In the private sector,
 wages are set by market forces. The Government pressures joint ventures not to pay
 salaries greater than those of ministers or other senior employees. Some joint ven-
 tures circumvent this with supplemental pay, including remuneration paid in for-
 eign exchange certificates, as well as through incentive and overtime pay and other
 fringe benefits. Foreign firms generally set wages near those of the domestic private
 
 
 sector but follow the example of joint ventures in awarding supplemental wages and
 benefits.
 There are no export processing zones. However, there are special military-owned
 industrial parks, such as Pyin-Ma-Biu near Rangoon, which attract foreign investors
 and often manufacture for export by offering cheaper labor than is available else-
 where. These are tantamount to export processing zones in many respects.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor re-
 mains a serious problem. At widespread locations throughout the country, inter-
 national observers have confirmed that the Government routinely coerces forced
 labor by citizens for local projects. In July a special ILO Commission of Inquiry
 found that the Government widely and systematically violated its obligations under
 ILO Convention 29, which prohibits forced labor. In March 1997, following an inves-
 tigation of the country's forced labor practices, the European Union Commission re-
 voked benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences. From 1992 to 1996, the
 Government supplemented declining gross investment with a significant increase in
 uncompensated citizen "contributions," chiefly of forced labor, to build or maintain
 irrigation, transportation, and tourism infrastructure projects. During 1996 the Gov-
 ernment introduced an initiative to use military personnel for infrastructure
 projects. This initiative and the increasing use of heavy construction equipment re-
 sulted in a decline since 1996 in the use of unpaid labor on physical infrastructure
 projects, especially for irrigation projects and railroad building. Nonetheless, the use
 of forced labor remains widespread.
 There have been conflicting reports about the use of forced labor on individual
 projects by both government and nongovernmental actors. Refugee accounts of some
 instances of forced labor on private projects appear to be credible. The Government
 has denied wholly or in part requests by observers from outside the country to con-
 duct independent visits and investigations. In September the U.S. Department of
 Labor issued a detailed report on forced labor practices in Burma.
 In some areas, government authorities forced members of non-Buddhist religious
 minorities to help construct pagodas.
 The army continued to force citizens-including women and children-to work as
 porters, which led to mistreatment, illness, and death, while conducting military ac-
 tions against ethnic insurgents (see Sections l.a., l.c., and 1.g.). The Government
 does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by children. While bonded
 labor is practiced, forced labor occurs in military porterage and in situations in
 which a family or household is required to contribute labor to a particular project.
 Children are called upon by parents to help fulfill that obligation without opposition
 by the Government (see Section 6.d.).
 Trafficking in women and girls for forced prostitution is a serious problem (see
 Section 5) in neighboring countries.
 The ILO report of its Commission of Inquiry described widespread and systematic
 use of forced labor in violation of ILO Convention 29 on forced labor. The Govern-
 ment refused to permit the Commission to visit. In compiling 6,000 pages of docu-
 mentation from outside Burma, the Commission concluded that there is abundant
 evidence showing pervasive use of forced labor in the country. The ILO Commission
 stated that women, children, and the elderly are unduly required to perform forced
 labor; porters often are sent into dangerous military situations, rarely receive medi-
 cal treatment; and are almost never compensated. The Commission stated that
 forced laborers frequently are beaten and that some women performing forced labor
 were raped or otherwise abused sexually by soldiers.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Although
 the law sets a minimum age of 13 for the employment of children, in practice the
 law is not enforced. Working children are highly visible in cities, mostly working
 for small or family enterprises, and in family agricultural activities in the country-
 side. Children working in the urban informal sector in Rangoon and Mandalay often
 start work at young ages. Children are hired at lower pay rates than adults for the
 same kind of work. In the urban informal sector, child workers are found mostly
 in food processing, selling, refuse collecting, light manufacturing, and as tea shop
 attendants. Despite a compulsory education law, almost 40 percent of children never
 enroll in school, and only 25 to 35 percent complete the 5-year primary school
 course. The law does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by children;
 while bonded labor is not practiced, forced labor by children occurs. The military
 Government not only tolerates child labor, but also uses children as porters in infra-
 structure development and in providing other services to military forces (see Section
 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Only government employees and employees of
 a few traditional industries are covered by minimum wage provisions. The minimum
 monthly wage for salaried public employees is $2.00 (600 kyats) for what is in effect
 
 
 a 6-hour workday. This sum is supplemented by various subsidies and allowances.
 The minimum wage does not provide a worker and family with a decent standard
 of living. The low level of pay in public employment fosters widespread corruption.
 Urban laborers earn about $0.70 per day (200 kyat), while rural agricultural work-
 ers earn about half that rate. Modern sector workers earn substantially more than
 day labor; a.skilled factory worker earns about $15 per day (4,500 kyat). Wage in-
 creases continued to lag far behind inflation.
 Surplus labor conditions and lack of protection by government authorities con-
 tinue to dictate substandard conditions for workers. The Law on Fundamental
 Workers Rights of 1964 and the Factories Act of 1951 regulate working conditions.
 There is a legally prescribed 5-day, 35-hour workweek for employees in the public
 sector and a 6-day and a 44-hour workweek for private and state enterprise employ-
 ees, with overtime paid for additional work. The law also allows for a 24-hour rest
 period per week, and workers have 21 paid holidays a year. Such provisions actually
 benefit only a small portion of the country's labor force, since 70 percent of the labor
 force is engaged in rural agriculture.
 Numerous health and safety regulations exist, but in practice the Government has
 not made the necessary resources -available to enforce the regulations, although
 workers may in principle remove themselves from hazardous conditions, in practice
 workers cannot expect to retain their jobs if they do so.
