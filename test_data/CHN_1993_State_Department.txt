 CHINA
 The People's Republic of China (PRC) remains a one-party state ruled by the Chi-
 nese Communist Party through a 21-member Politburo and a small circle of offi-
 cially retired but still powerful senior leaders. Almost all top civilian, police, and
 military positions at the national and regional levels are held by party members.
 Despite official adherence to Marxism-Leninism, in recent years economic decision-
 making has become 'ess ideological, more decentralized, and increasingly market
 oriented. Fundamental human rights provided for in the Constitution are frequently
 ignored in practice, and challenges to the Communist Party's political authority are
 often dealt with harshly and arbitrarily.
 Security forces, comprised of a nationwide network which includes the People's
 Liberation Army, the Ministry of State Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the
 People's Armed Police, and the state judicial, procuratorial, and penal systems, are
 poorly monitored due to the absence of adequate legal safegua   or adequate en-
 forcement of existing safeguards for those detained, accused, or imprisoned. They
 are responsible for widespread and well-documented human rights abuses, including
 torture, forced confessions, and arbitrary detentions.
 A decade of rapid economic growth, spurred by market incentives and foreign in-
 vestment, has reduced party and government control over the economy and per-
 mitted ever larger numbers of Chinese to have more control over their lives and
 livelihood. Despite significant income disparities between coastal regions and the in-
 terior, there is now a growing "middle class" in the cities and rural areas as well
 as a sharp decline in the number of Chinese at the subsistence level. These eco-
 nomic changes have led to a de facto end to the role of ideology in the economy and
 an increase in cultural diversity. An example of this is the media, which remains
 tightly controlled with regard to political questions, although it now is free to report
 on a wider variety of other issues.
 The Government took some positive steps on human rights issues during 1993.
 It released some prominent political prisoners early or on medical parole; many had
 served long terms in prison. The Government still hrts not provided a full or public
 accounting of the thousands of persons detained during the suppression of the 1989
 democracy movement, when millions of students, workers, and intellectuals defied
 the Government and participated in public demonstrations. Most of these detainees
 appear to have been released, however, some after serving periods of detention with-
 out charges having been brought and some after having completed their prison sen-
 tences. The Government says it has released the remaining imprisoned or detained
 Vatican loyalists among the Catholic clergy. Although it continues to restrict the
 movements and activities of some elderly priests and bishops, the Government an-
 nounced in November that two priests, whose movements had been restricted, were
 
 
 605
 free to return to their homes. The authorities also allowed a number of prominent
 political dissidents to leave China in 1993. In November the Government announced
 it would give positive consideration to a request from the International Committee
 of the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit China.
 Nevertheless, the Government's overall human rights record in 1993 fell far short
 of internationally accepted norms as it continued to regress domestic critics and
 failed to control abuses by its own security forces. The Government detained, sen-
 tenced to prison, or sent to labor camps, and in a few cases expelled from the coun-
 try, persons who sought to exercise their rights of freedom of assembly and speech.
 The number of persons in Chinese penal institutions considered political prisoners
 by international standards is impossible to estimate accurately. rn 1993 hundreds,
 perhaps thousands, of political prisoners remained under detention or in prison.
 Physical abuse, including torture by police and prison officials persisted, especially
 in politically restive regions with minority populations like Tibet. Criminal defend-
 ants continue to be demed legal safeguards such as due process or adequate defense.
 In many localities, government authorities continued to harass and occasionally de-
 tain Christians who practiced their religion outsid e  officially sponsored religious
 organizations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section . Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extra udicial Killing.-There were accounts of extrajudicial
 killings by overnment officials in 1993. A few cases resulted in severe punishment
 for the officials involved and were widely publicized as admonitory examples. Local
 officials beat to death an Anhui farmer in February after he protested the level of
 taxes and fees. Those found directly responsible for the beating, including a local
 public security official, received Iong prison terms and, in one case, a death sen-
 tenc. Other officials were dismissed or disciplined. Also, in another well-publicized
 case, the powerful local Communist party secretary of a village near Tianjin was
 sentenced in August to 20 years in prison for obstruction of justice and other of-
 fenses related to a December 1992 beating death. Those who actually took part in
 the beating also received Iongprison terms.
 The official responses to other cases served to cover up abuses, however. Cedible
 reports indicated that a Shnanxi man beaten by public security officials in March,
 during a raid on an unauthorized Protestant gathering, died as a result of his inju-
 ries and the lack of timely medical care while in police custody. An official autopsy
 ascribed the death to an unrelated illness.
 Because the Government often restricts access to such information, it is impos-
 sible to determine the total number of such killings. However, accordingto a credi-
 ble report issued in 1993 by a human rights group, at least 12 persons ied in 1992
 as a result of torture while in police custody.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reported cases in 1993 in which persons who
 disappeared were suspected to have been killed by officials, however, the Govern-
 ment has still not provided a comprehensive, credible public accounting of all those
 missing or detained in connection with the suppression of t th1989 demonstrations.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Cases of torture and degrading treatment of detained and imprisoned persons p- .r-
 sisted. Both official Chinese sources and international human rights groups reported
 many instances of torture. Persons detained pending trial were particularly at risk
 as a result of weaknesses in the legal system, including the emphasis n obtaninig
 confessions as a basis for convictions and the lack of access to prisoners, even by
 family members, until after formal chaes are brought, a step that can be delayed
 for months. Former detainees have crdibly reported the use of cattle prods and
 electrodes, prolonged periods of solitary conement and incommunicado detention,
 beatings, shackles, and other forms of abuse against detained women and men.
 While generally refusing to allow impartial observers to visit prisoners, officials
 stated that internal monitoring and laws to prevent and punish abuses continue to
 be strengthened. Procurator General Liu    Fuzhi said in March that 2,800
 procuratorate offices had been set up in jails and detention centers to safeguard the
 welfare of detainees. In response to a call by the Chairman of the Nationl People's
 Conress (NPC), a national-level procuratorial conference held in Shanghai in early
 April focused on measures to improve the Procuratorate's supervision oflaw enforce-
 ment personnel and government officials who violate the civil rights of citizens. In
 August the Guangdong provincial public security bureau issued a regulation forbid-
 ding police torture during interrogations. In April China told the U.N. Committee
 Agains    ut o     339 cases of torture to extract confessions were investigated
 during 1992, 209 eases were reported to the Procuratorate with a view to prosecu-
 
 
 606
 tion, and 180 prosecutions were brought. No information on convictions or punish-
 ments was provided. While Chinese officials said in December that 23 prison offi-
 cials had been punished in serious cases of mistreatment of prisoners, the number
 of actual incidents of torture and ill-treatment by government officials is almost cer-
 tainly far greater than this number.
 Conditions of imprisonment for political prisoners vary widely. Some prisoners, in-
 cluding the student leader Wang Dan, who was released in February, have stated
 they were treated reasonably well. Credible reports indicate others have been
 abused. Political prisoners are often intermingled with common criminals. Credible
 reports persisted in 1993 that Liu Gang, a political prisoner held at a Liaoning labor
 camp, suffers ill health as a result of beatings and other mistreatment, and that
 prison officials instigated some beatings by cellmates. Officials strongly denied these
 allegations and arranged for an interview with Liu and his jailers, which was pub-
 lished in August by a Chinese English-language journal. They declined repeated re-
 quests by foreign groups to allow access to the jailed dissident by independent ob-
 servers.
 There was limited evidence that, at least in a few cases, detained dissidents have
 been incarcerated in psychiatric institutions and treated with drugs. The lack of
 independent outside access to such persons made it impossible to verify the reports.
 Shanghai dissident Wang Miaogen was detained by public security officials in May
 and committed to a mental institution after he attempted to protest the holding of
 the East Asia games. Wang had earlier chopped off four of his fingers in a protest
 over alleged persecution. Wang Wanxing, detained in 1992 while attempting to
 stage a one-man protest on Tiananmen Square, continued to be held in a Beijing-
 area mental hospital.
 Conditions in Chinese penal institutions are generally harsh and frequently de-
 grading, and nutritional and health conditions are sometimes grim. Medical care for
 prisoners has been a problem area, despite official assurances that prisoners have
 the right to maintain good health and receive prompt medical treatment if they be-
 come ill. In 1993 political prisoners who reportedly had difficulties in obtaining
 timely and adequate medical care included Wang Juntao, Chen Ziming, and Ren
 Wanding. Medical paroles may be granted to ailing prisoners, and 1989 detainee Li
 Guiren was released in January to obtain medical treatment. Working conditions for
 prisoners in many facilities are similar to those in ordinary factories, but some pris-
 oners working in penal coal mines and at other sites must endure dangerous condi-
 tions (see Section 6.c.).
 Political prisoner Qi Dafeng continued to serve a 2-year sentence in a coal mine
 in Anhui, where he had been sent under the nonjudicial "reeducation through labor"
 program in late 1992.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-China's Criminal Procedure Law pro-
 scribes arbitrary arrest or detention, limits the time a person may be held in cus-
 tody without being charged, and requires officials to notify the detainee's family and
 work unit of the detention within 24 hours. These provisions are subject to several
 important exceptions, including the sweeping provision that notification may be
 withheld if it would "hinder the investigation of a case. Senior judicial officials ac-
 knowledged in 1993 that limits on detention are frequently ignored in practice or
 circumvented by various informal mechanisms. In numerous cases, the precise legal
 status or location of detainees is unclear. Public security authorities often detain
 uople for long periods of time under mechanisms not covered by the Criminal Pro-
 cedure Law. These include unpublished regulations on "taking in for shelter and in-
 vestigation" and 'supervised residence" as well as other methods not requiring proc-
 uratorial approval. According t the Chinese media, close to 1 million detentions
 under "she Iter for investigation have been carried out annually in recent years. No
 statistics were available to indicate the usual length of these detentions, but at least
 some lasted several months. Links between local officials and business leaders have
 resulted in scattered detentions as a means of exerting pressure in economic dis-
 putes. The legality of detentions may be judicially challenged under the Administra-
 tive Procedures Law, but such challenges are rare and there is little evidence that
 this is an adequate or timely remedy for improper actions. There is no judicially su-
 pervisd system of bail, but at the discretion of public security officials some detain-
 ees are released ending further investigation.
 Political dissidents are often detainednor charged for having committed hcrimes of
 counterrevolution" under Articles  90  through  104   of the  Criminal Law.
 Counterrevolutionary offenses range from  treason and espionage to spreading
 counter-revolutionary propaganda. These articles have also been used to punish per-
 sons who organized demonstrations, disrupted traffic, disclosed official information
 to foreigners, or formed associations outside state control. Detention and trial of dis-
 sidents on other charges is also possible. People participating in unauthorized reli-
 
 
 607
 gioUS organizations may be charged with criminal offenses such as receiving funds
 fm abroad without authorization or changing such funds on the black market.
 Legal provisions requiring family notification and limiting length of detention are
 often ignored in political cases. Liao Jia'an, a university studen in Beijing detained
 in 1992 for peaceful expression of his political views, was held for a year before
 being formally arrested in mid-1993 for counterrevolutionary crimes..
 A well-documented estimate of the total number of those subjected to new or con-
 tinued arbitrary arrest or detention for political reasons is not possible due to the
 Government's tight control of information. Individuals reported detained are some-
 times released without charge after several days or weeks of interrogation. There
 were several reported lengthier detentions of dissidents, including Sun Lin, Wang
 Miaogen, and Zhang Xianliang, in Shanghai during 1993. Sun was released in Au-
 gust after 5 months in detention. Democracy activists Qin Yongmin, Yang Zhou, and
 Zheng Xuguang were detained in November in connection with the formation of a
 group called the 'Peace Charter." Yang Zhou was released from detention on Decem-
 ber 31, but the authorities had not provided information on the status or location
 of the other peace charter detainees. Several dozen Tibetans were also reported to
 have been detained after participation in proindependence demonstrations or activi-
 ties (see Section 5). Gendun Rinchen, a Tibetan tour guide who had been detained
 in May 1993, was released on January 14, 1994
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Officials insist that China's judiciary is independ-
 ent but acknowledge that it is subject to the Communist Partys policy guidance. In
 actuality, party and government leaders almost certainly predetermine verdicts and
 sentences in some sensitive cases. According to the Constitution, the court system
 is equal in authority to the State Council and the Central Military Commission, the
 two most important government institutions. All three organs are nominally under
 the supervision of the National People's Congress. The Supreme People's Court
 stands at the apex of the court system, followed in descending order by the higher,
 intermediate, and basic people's courts.
 Due process rights are provided for in the Constitution but are often ignored in
 practice. Both before and after trial, prisoners are subject to severe psychological
 pressure to confess their "errors." Defendants who fail to "show the right attitude"
 by confessing their crimes are typically sentenced more harshly. Despite official
 media and other reports that indicate coerced confessions have led to erroneous con-
 victions, a coerced confession is not automatically excluded as evidence. According
 to judicial officials, however, confessions without corroborating evidence are an in-
 sufficient basis for conviction.
 Accused persons are given virtually no opportunity to prepare a defense in the
 pretrial process, during which the question of guilt or innocence is essentially de-
 cided administratively. Defense lawyers may be retained only 7 days before the
 trial. In some cases even this brief period has been shortened under regulations is-
 sued in 1983 to accelerate the adjudication of certain serious criminal cases. Persons
 appearing before a court are not presumed innocent; despite official denials, trials
 are essentially sentencing hearings. Conviction rates average over 99 percent. There
 is an a peal process, but initial decisions are rarely overturned, and appeals gen-
 erally d not provide meaningful protection against arbitrary or erroneous verdicts.
 Like the initial court verdict, the judgment of the Appeals Court is subject to Coi-
 munist Party "guidance."
 Under the Criminal Procedure Law, persons "exempted from prosecution" by proc-
 urators are deemed to have a criminal record, despite the lack of a judicial deter-
 mination of guilt. Such provisions can be applied in "counterrevolutionary crimes*
 as well as for ordinary criminal offenses. In August Shanghai activists Sun Lin, Yao
 Tiansheng,    and   Han    Lifa   were    "exempted    from   prosecution"   for
 counterrevolutionary offenses and released.
 Some officials have acknowledged that trials in China are conducted too rapidly.
 These officials state that China's 70,000 lawyers, most of whom are engaged in com-
 mercial law, are insufficient to meet the country's expanding legal needs and point
 to the Government's intention to increase this number to at least 150,000. Knowl-
 edgeable observers report that defense attorneys appear in only a small number of
 criminal trials. Under Chinese law, there is no requirement that the court appoint
 a defense attorney for the defendant unless the defendant is deaf, dumb, or a minor.
 When attorneys do appear, they have little time to prepare a defense and rarely con-
 test guilt; their function is generally confined to requesting clemency. Defense law-
 yers, like other Chinese, generally depend on an official work unit for employment,
 housing, and many other aspects of their lives. They are therefore often reluctant
 to be viewed as overzealous in defending persons accused of political offenses.
 The need for adequate, independent legal aid is increasingly understood in legal
 circles and within the Government. In many cities, law firms are being organized
 
 
 608
 
 outside the framework of established government legal offices. These firms are self-
 regulating and do not have their personnel or budgets determined directly by the
 State. The Minister of Justice announced in October that China would gradu ally in-
 crease the number of autonomous law firms from the current total of 410.
 The Criminal Procedure Law requires that all trials be held in public, except
 those involving state secrets, juveniles, or "personal secrets." Details of cases involv-
 ing "counterrevolutionary" ciiarges, however, have frequently been kept secret, even
 from defendants' relatives, under this prvision. The 11988 Law on State Secrets af-
 fords a ready basis for denying a public trial in cases involving "counterrevolution."
 Lack of due process is particularly egregious when defendants receive the death
 sentence. Chinese officials refuse to provid~e comprehensive statistics on death sen-
 tences or executions, but hundreds of executions are officially reported annually.
 The actual numbers may be much higher. All death sentences are nominally re-
 viewed by a higher court. Reviews are usually completed within a few days after
 sentencing and consistently result in a perfunctory confirmation of sentence. How-
 ever, no executions for political offenses are known to have occurred in 1993.
 In addition to the formal judicial system, government authorities can assifn per-
 sons accused of "minor" public order and "counterrevolutionary" offenses to reedu-
 cation through labor" camps in an extrajudicial process. In 1990 Chinese officials
 stated that 869,934 Chinese citizens had been assigned to these camps since 1980,
 with about 80,000 assigned each year. Chinese officials reported 120,000 prisoners
 were undergoing "reeducation through labor" at the end of 1993. Other estimates
 of the number of inmates are considerably higher. Terms of detention run from a
 normal minimum of 1 year to a maximum of 3 years. The "labor reeducation" com-
 mittee which determines the term of detention may extend an inmate's sentence for
 an additional year. Under a State Council regulation issued in early 1991, those
 sentenced to "reeducation through labor" may ask the committee to reconsider their
 decision. Since 1990, "reeducation through labor" sentences may also be judicially
 challenged under the Administrative Procedures Law. While some persons have
 gained reduction or withdrawal of their sentence after reconsideration or appeal, in
 practice these procedures are rarely used, and short appeal times, lack of access to
 lawyers, and other problems weaken their potential assistance in preventing or re-
 versing arbitrary decisions.
 The system of "reeducation through labor" sometimes is used by security authori-
 ties to deal with political and other offenders without reference to even the nominal
 procedures and protections the formal criminal process offers. In Shanghai, Fu
 Shenqi and Zhang Xianliang were given 3-yrear "reeducation through labor" sen-
 tences in July for provoking incidents" and inciting trouble" which disturbed pub-
 lic order.
 Government officials deny that China has any political prisoners, asserting that
 persons are detained not for the  litical views they hold, but because they have
 taken some action which violates the Criminal Law. The number of persons in Chi-
 nese penal institutions considered political prisoners by international standards is
 impossible to estimate accurately. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of political pris-
 oners remained imprisoned or detained. Estimates by some foreign researchers of
 the number of political prisoners are much higher. Many if not most people held
 for political offenses are charged as counterrevolutionaries. Chinese officials said in
 December there were 3,172 persons serving sentences for counter-revolutionary
 crimes, down from a figure of 3,317 given to an American human rights monitor in
 October. As part of the October figure, officials also indicated that 560 persons con-
 victed of counterrevolutionary crimes had been paroled. Those convicted of
 counterrevolutionary crimes make up 0.2 percent of the total prisoner population of
 1.22 million, but they are about 5 percent of total parolees. As recently as November
 1992, an Australian delegation was told there     were 4,000 in    prison  for
 counterrevolutionary crimes. All these estimates almost certainly include a substan-
 tial number of persons convicted of espionage or other internationally recognized
 criminal offenses. At the same time, the figures exclude many political prisoners de-
 tained but not charged, persons held in labor reeducation camps and an undeter-
 mined number of persons sentenced for criminal offenses due solely to their non-
 violent political or religious activities.
 Many prominent activists, including Chen Ziming, Wang Juntao, and Liu Gang
 (all three held since 1989), remained imprisoned in 1993. Some persons detained for
 political reasons were released on parole before the end of their sentences. Those
 released early included longtime political prisoners Wei Jingsheng, Wang Xizhe, and
 Xu Wenli, and Tiananmen-related detainees Wang Dan, Gao Shan, Zhai Weimin,
 Wu Xuecan, and Guo Haifeng. Shanghai activist Fu Shenqi was released in March
 but reimprisoned on other charges in June. Even after release, such persons have
 a criminal record, and their status in society, ability to be employed, freedom to
 
 
 609
 travel, and numerous other aspects of their lives are often severely restricted. Eco-
 nomic reform and social change have somewhat diminished these problems, but
 some people continue to experience serious hardships. For example, the families of
 political prisoners sometimes encounter difficulty in obtaining or keeping employ-
 ment and housing. Zhang Fengying, wife of imprisoned activist Ren Wanding, re-
 mained in poor housing conditions in 1993. Zhang and her teenage daughter were
 evicted from their apartment in 1992. Ren's work unit owns the apartment. While
 the work unit asserted it wanted to reassign the housing to another worker, the
 apartment reportedly has remained vacant.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The au-
 thorities extensively monitor and regulate personal and family life, particularly in
 China's cities. Most persons in urban areas still depend on their government-linked
 work unit for housing, permission to marry or have a child, approval to apply for
 a passport, and other aspects of ordinary life. The work unit, a ong with the neigh-
 borhood watch committee, is charged with monitoring activities and attitudes. How-
 ever, changes in the economic structure, including the growing diversity of employ-
 ment opportunities and the increasing market orientation of many work units, are
 undermining the effectiveness of this system. Search warrants are required by law
 before security frces can search premises, but this prvision is oft en ignored. In ad-
 dition, both the Public Security Bureau and procuracy apparently can issue search
 warrants on their own authority.
 The 1982 Constitution states that "freedom and privacy of correspondence of citi-
 zens.., are protected by law,A but, according to a Western expert on Chinese law,
 legislation for this purpose does not exist. In practice, some telephone conversations
 are recorded and mail is frequently opened and censored. The Government often
 monitors and sometimes restricts contact between foreigners and Chinese citizens,
 particularly dissidents.
 The Government has continued its effort to control citizens' access to outside
 sources of information, selectively jamming Chinese language broadcasts of the
 Voice of America (VOA) and the British Broadcasting Corporation. Despite the effort
 made to jam VOA, the effectiveness of the jamming varies considerably by region,
 with audible signals reaching most parts of China. A small but rapidly growing seg-
 ment of the population has access to satellite television broadcasts. Authorities is-
 sued new regulations on the installation and operation of satellite dishes in October,
 requiring permits for operation and banning private ownership and operation except
 under limited circumstances. However, China has not been very successful in imple-
 menting past regulations restricting the use of satellite dishes. Satellite television
 dishes are widely available for sale, and a licensing scheme which nominally con-
 trols purchase of the equipment is loosely enforced.
 ChIna's population has roughly doubled in the past 40 years to nearly 1.2 billion
 people, over a fifth of all humanity. In the 1970's and 1980's China adopted a coi-
 rehensive and highly intrusive family planning policy. This policy most heavily af-
 fects Han Chinese in urban areas. For urban couples, obtaining permission, usually
 issued by their work units, to have a second childis very difficult. Numerous excep-
 tions are allowed for the 70 percent of Han who live in rural areas. Ethnic minori-
 ties are subject to less stringent population controls. Enforcement of the family
 planning policy is inconsistent, varying widely from place to place and year to year.
 The population control policy relies on education, propaganda, and economic in-
 centives, as well as more coercive measures, including psychological pressure and
 economic penalties. Rewards for couples who adhere to the policy include monthly
 stipends and preferential medical and educational benefits.
 Disciplinary measures against those who violate the policy include stiff fines,
 withholding of social services, demotion, and other administrative punishments, in-
 cluding, in some instances, loss of employment. Unpaid fines have sometimes re-
 sulted in confiscation or destruction of personal property. Because penalties for ex-
 cess births may be levied against local officials and the mothers' work units, many
 persons are affected, providing multiple sources of pressure.
 Physical compulsion to submit to abortion or sterilization is not authorized, but
 Chinese officials acknowledge privately that there are still instances of forced abor-
 tions and sterilizations in remote, rural areas. Officials maintain that when discov-
 ered, abuses by local officials result in discipline or retraining. They admit, however,
 that stronger punishment is rare and have not documented any cases where punish-
 ment has occurred. A sharp reported drop in fertility rates in 1991-92 sparked con-
 cern about a possible upturn in incidents of coercion. One cause for worry about
 such increased pressures was a policy change in early 1991 making local political
 officials more directly responsible for success in meeting family quotas. There was
 strong evidence, however, that the magnitude of the reported fertility drop was
 
 
 610
 sharply exaggerated, in part because the policy change intensified strong existing
 incentives for officials and families to underreport births.
 At least five provincial governments have implemented regulations with eugenics
 provisions, beginning with Gansu in 1988. These regulations seek to prevent people
 with severe mental handicaps from having children. National family planning offi-
 cials say they oppose such legislation, but the Government has taken no action to
 overturn these local laws.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and self-expression remain
 severely restricted, although there has been an easing of the limits imposed during
 the post-Tiananmen crackdown. Citizens are not permitted to publish or broadcast
 criticism of senior leaders or opinions that contradict basic Communist Party doc-
 trine which provides for a Socialist state under the party's control, or to make
 speeches which contain such criticism or opinions. The Government interprets the
 Communist Party's "leading role" as circumscribing the various individual rights
 guaranteed in the Constitution. People who violate these quidelines are warned and
 often punished. Gao Yu, a former writer of a now banned periodical, was charged
 in October with "leaking state secrets abroad" in connection with articles published
 in Hong Kong. Xi Yang, a Hong Kong reporter, was detained in September for
 "stealing" financial secrets in connection with articles published in Hong Kong.
 Domestic television and radio broadcasting and the press remain under party and
 government control and are used to propagate the currently acceptable ideological
 line. A more lively tabloid sector continued to expand in 1993, and the circulation
 of major propaganda-oriented dailies continued to slip.
 Radio talk shows also flourished and, although they generally avoided politically
 sensitive subjects, they provided some opportunity for Chinese to discuss, and some-
 times question officials about, public issues, including corruption. Under official
 pressure, the film "Farewell My Concubine," which caused controversy because of
 its implicit criticism of the cultural revolution and portrayal of a homosexual rela-
 tionship, was withdrawn from distribution in July after showings in Beijing and
 Shanghai. After further editing, it was rereleased in September.
 The Government has continued to impose tight controls on colleges universities,
 and research institutes. However, Beijing University and Shan ai s ludan Univer-
 sity stopped sending students to a full year of training and ideological indoctrination
 at military camps, a requirement imposed in 1989. The heavy ideological control of
 academic institutions and media censorship continued to force Chinese journalists
 and scholars to exercise caution in 1993. Many scholars, including some of China's
 most prominent, have been deterred from exercising free speech and have declined
 opportunities to publish or present papers on subjects that they fear could be con-
 strued as sensitive. On some less sensitive but still controversial subjects, such as
 economic policy, legal reform and even civil rights issues, the Government has toler-
 ated more vigorous public discussion. Some authors who were considered politically
 unacceptable after 1989, such as legal scholar Yu Haocheng, were able to overcome
 bans and regain at least limited ability toget articles published in 1993.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Associtn.-Wile the Constitution pro-
 vides for freedom of peacful assembly and association, these rights are severely re-
 stricted in practice. The Constitution provides, for example, that such activities may
 not infringe "upon the interests of the State," and in practice protests against the
 political system or its leaders are proscribed. Demonstrations involving expression
 of dissident political views are denied permits and suppressed if held. Qin  on
 was briefly detained several times when he attempted to leave his native Wuhan
 for Beijing to protest against the capital's bid to host the Olympic Games in the year
 2000 (see Section 1.d). However, some small-scale demonstrations on nonpolitical
 grievances are tolerated in practice. In February there were two small demonstra-
 tions at the gate of the Zhonpnanhai leadership compound in Beijing by women laid
 off from a state steel firm. n August authorities also tolerated generally peaceful
 demonstrations in several provinces by Muslims, sometimes number  gin the thou-
 sands, who were prtesting a book they found offensive. The book was subsequently
 banned. Demonstrators protesting the same book in Qinghai in October, however,
 were met with force when Muslim demonstrators threatened to take their protest
 to Beijing. According to credible reports, there were at least nine deaths.
 Public securit forces acted withmore restraint than in the past to demonstra-
 tions in Lhasa in May, which began with a small protest on economic grievances
 but attracted hundreds of additional participants, including many who shouted
 prindependence slogans and some who threw rocks. Several dozen persons were be-
 wieved to have been at least briefly detained in the wake of the protests, but reports
 of a handful of deaths or serious injuries from the impact of tear gas projectiles ap-
 
 
 peared to be erroneous. According to human rights organizations, smaller scale pro-
 tests were reported to have occurred frequently in the Tibetan capital and resulted
 in swift detention for the participants. Gendun Rinchen and Lobsang Yonten were
 detained in May, apparently because of alleged proindependence activities, and they
 were held through the remainder of the year be ore being released in January 1994.
 Tibetan politica prisoners like Yulo Dawa Tsering, Ngawang Pulchung, and Jempel
 Tsering remainedimprisoned in 1993. While repression continued, there was at the
 same time a continuation of limited dialog on Tibet with representatives of the
 Dalai Lama.
 The Communist Party organizes and controls most professional and other mass
 associations. All organizations are required by 1990 regulations to be officially reg-
 istered and approved. Ostensibly aimed at secret societies and criminal gangs, the
 regulations also deter the formation of unauthorized political or labor organizations.
 They have also been used to disband groups, such as unregistered house churches,
 deemed potentially subversive. Security forces maintain a close watch on groups
 formed outside the party establishment.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Religious freedom in China is subject to restrictions of
 varying severity. While the Constitution affirms toleration of religious beliefs, the
 Government restricts religious practice outside officially recognized and government-
 controlled religious organizations. The management and control of religion is the re-
 sponsibility of religious affairs bureaus, which are staffed by officials who rarely are
 believers in religion. Communist Party officials state that party membership and re-
 ligious belief are incompatible. This places a serious limitation on religious believ-
 ers since party membership is required for almost all high positions in government-
 and state-owned businesses.
 The Government, after forcefully suppressing all religious observances during the
 1966-76 cultural revolution, began in the late 1970's to restore or replace con-
 fiscated churches, temples, mosques, and monasteries. The official religious organi-
 zations administer more than a dozen Catholic and Protestant seminaries, nine in-
 stitutes to train imams and Islamic scholars, and institutes to train Buddhist
 monks. Students who attend these institutes must demonstrate "political reliabil-
 ity," and all graduates must pass an examination on their theological and political
 knowledge to qualify for the clergy. The Government permitted Catholic seminar-
 ians from several cities to go to the United States in 1993 for additional religious
 studies. There have also been increased contacts between China and the Vatican.
 The Government supervises the publication of religious material for distribution
 to ensure religious and political conformity. Religious books Pre not permitted in or-
 dinary bookstores, and there are persistent complaints that the number of Bibles
 and amounts of other religious materials allowed to be printed fall far short of de-
 mand. Religious proselytizing is officially restricted to government-registered and
 sanctioned places of worship. Unauthorized proselytizing is proscribed and some-
 times punished although some discreet proselytizing and distributing of religious
 texts outside official channels is tolerated. Local authorities have confiscated private
 property under the guise of searching for illegal religious materials. Officially sanc-
 tioned religious organizations are permitted to maintain international contacts as
 long as these do not entail foreign control, but proselytizing by foreign groups is for-
 bidden by law and regulation.
 Buddhists are by far the largest body of religious believers in China. The Govern-
 ment estimates that there are 100 million Chinese Buddhists, most of whom are
 from the dominant Han ethnic group. Other Buddhists belong to Tibetan, Mongo-
 lian, and other ethnic groups. Han Buddhist leaders generally cooperate with the
 Government and there have been few complaints of government restrictions.
 In Tibet, however, where Buddhism and Tibetan nationalism are closely inter-
 twined, relations between Buddhists and secular authorities continued to be tense
 in 1993. The Government tightly controls Tibetan Buddhism and does not tolerate
 religious manifestations that advocate Tibetan independence.
 The Government condemns the Dalai Lama's political activities and his leadership
 of a "government in exile," but recognizes him as a major religious figure and has
 tolerated the open veneration of the Dalai Lama by Tibetans. The Government has
 spent large amounts of money on reconstruction of the main sacred sites, including
 t   Potala Palace and a grand stupa to house the remains of the 10th Panchen
 Lama. Chinese officials have also publicly asked the Dalai Lama to assist in the
 process of finding the reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama, who died in 1989.
 The practice of religion in Tibet is hampered, however, by the limits the Govern-
 ment imposes on religious education and on the number of monks in the religious
 community compared to traditional norms. Monks at some Tibetan monasteries
 known for their opposition to Chinese rule face severe travel restrictions and intense
 monitoring.

 According to government figures, there are 17 million Muslims in China. In some
 areas with large Muslim populations, there continues to be concern regarding re-
 strictions on the building of mosques and the religious education of youths under
 18. Following the 1990 unrest in Xinjiang, the authorities issued regulations further
 restricting religious activities and teaching. China permits Muslim citizens to make
 the hajj to Mecca, and the number of those making the hajj has significantly in-
 creased in recent years. Nongovernment sources indicate that about 5,000 Chinese
 made the haji in 1992.
 The number of Christians has grown rapidly in recent years albeit from a small
 base. Only those Christian churches affiliated with either the Catholic Patriotic As-
 sociation or the (Protestant) Three-Self Patriotic Movement, which the Government
 established in the 1950's to eliminate perceived foreign domination of Christian
 groups, may operate openly. Active unofficial religious movements pose an alter-
 native to the state-regulated churches. The unofficial, Vatican-affiliated, Catholic
 Church claims a membership far larger than the 3.7 million registered with the offi-
 cial Catholic church, though actual figures are unknown. In addition to the 5 million
 persons who are officially counted as following Protestantism, a large number of
 Protestants worship privately in "house churches" that are independent of govern-
 ment control.
 Sporadic repression in some areas has reflected official concern over the Govern-
 ment's inability to control the rapid growth of membership in Christian groups.
 There continued to be credible reports in 1993 of efforts by authorities in some areas
 to rein in activities of the unapproved Catholic and Protestant movements, including
 raiding and closing a number of unregistered churches. In March public security of-
 ficials disrupted a Protestant religious gathering in Shaanxi, beating many of those
 present. One man beaten later died, apparently of wounds suffered in the incident
 (see Section L.a.). However, authorities in many areas tolerate the existence of unof-
 ficial Catholic and Protestant churches as long as they remain small and discreet.
 In some parts of China, official and underground churches seem to coexist and even
 cooperate. The Cuangzhou House Church of Pastor Samuel Lamb (Lin Xiangao) con-
 tinued to operate openly, although with frequent harassment by authorities.
 A number of religious activists remained imprisoned in 1993, but others were re-
 leased. There was some evidence that authorities have increasingly used short-term
 detentions, rather than long prison terms when dealing with unauthorized -religious
 activities. Some of those released from penal detention were apparently placed
 under house arrest or other restrictions. The number of Catholic clerics in peIal de-
 tention dropped sharply in 1992 and 1993, although the whereabouts of some re-
 ported to have been released could not be confirmed, and others remained under
 some restrictions. Catholic Gansu bishop Casimir Wang Milu and Hebei priest Pei
 Ronggui were released from long-term imprisonment during the year. Ministry of
 Public Security officials told a visiting U.S. official in October that there were no
 Catholic clerics remaining in detention. In November Bishop Peter Chen Jianzhang
 and auxiliary bishop Cosmas Shi Enxianj were reportedly released from either pris-
 on or house arrest in "old people's homes.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government uses an identification card system to control and re-
 strict individual residence location within the country. This system's effectiveness
 has eroded during China's shift to a more market-oriented economy. The need for
 a supplemental work force in the areas of fastest economic growth has led to official
 tolerance for a large itinerant population which is not in compliance with formal re-
 quirements to obtain permission to change residence. However, because this itin-
 erant population lacks official status, access to housing, schooling, and the full range
 of employment opportunities can be restricted.
 Some former inmates have been denied permission, under the "staying at prison
 employment" system, to return to their homes, a provision applicable to those incar-
 cerated in both the "reform through labor" and the "reeducation through labor" sys-
 tems. For those assigned to camps far from their residences, this constitutes a form
 of internal exile. The number ofprisoners subject to this restriction is unknown. A
 Vice Minister of Justice told a British human rights delegation in late 1992 that
 no former prisoners were subject to such restrictions.
 The Government routinely permits legal emigration and most foreign travel but
 has placed obstacles in the way of foreign travel by a few citizens on political or
 other grounds. Legal scholar Yu Haocheng continued to be unable to obtain permis-
 sion to travel abroad. These obstacles extend to some dissidents' family members
 who have not themselves been active politically or accused of any wrongdoing by the
 Government. Other dissidents, including Hou Xiaotian, Li Honglin, and Qian Liyun,
 were eventually able to obtain the passports and exit permits needed to leave the
 country.
 
 
 613
 Regulations issued in 1990 require those college and university graduates who re-
 ceived free postsecondary education to repay the cost of their education to the State
 by working for 5 years or more before being eligible for passports to go abroad to
 study. For those who have overseas Chinese relatives or have not yet graduated, the
 regulations provide a sliding scale of tuition reimbursement exempting them from
 the work requirement. Implementation of these regulations has varied from place
 to place, and most students wishing to go abroad still managed to obtain passports.
 Persons subject to the regulations on study abroad appear to have had little trouble
 obtaining passports to visit relatives overseas. Political attitudes, however, arc still
 a major criterion in selecting people for government-sponsored study abroad.
 The Government has made a concerted effort to attract back to China persons
 who have studied overseas. To reassure them, Chinese citizens who return from
 overseas were exempted in 1992 from re-exit formalities, which had involved Public
 Security Bureau clearances. However, official media have stated that, before return-
 ing home, people who have joined foreign organizations viewed by the Government
 as hostile to China should quit them and refrain from activities that violate Chinese
 Law. Procurator General Liu Fuzhi warned in 1992 that people wanted by the pub-
 lic security authorities were not covered by the official assurances extended to other
 overseas scholars.
 Some dissidents, such as Dai Qing and Liu Xiaobo, reentered China without inci-
 dent in 1993. In August labor activist Han Dongfang, who had been allowed to leave
 for medical treatment in the United States in 1992, was expelled shortly after he
 returned. Han's passport was subsequently revoked by Chinese authorities on the
 grounds that he had engaged in activities hostile to China while overseas. Chinese
 border officials frustrated Han's several subsequent attempts to return to China.
 Another labor activist, Lu Jinghua, was refused entry in June when she arrived at
 the Beijing airport. Lu had fled China in 1989 before she could be arrested. A hand-
 ful of prominent dissidents overseas continued to have difficulty extending or renew-
 ing passports.
 The Government accepts the repatriation of citizens who have entered other coun-
 tries or territories illegally. In 1993, in addition to the routine return of Chinese
 illegal immigrants found in Hong Kong, China accepted the return of several large
 groups of illegal immigrants from other countries, including Mexico, Honduras, and
 the Marshall Islands. Citizens illegally smuggled to other countries are often de-
 tained for a short time after their return to China to determine their identity and
 any past criminal record or involvement in smuggling activities. As a deterrent and
 to recover repatriation costs, authorities in some areas levy a fine of about $1,000
 equivalent on returnees.
 China does not have legislation in place that would allow it to grant refugee sta-
 tus and, with the exception of Vietnamese refugees of Chinese ancestry, has gen-
 erally repatriated persons of other nationalities seeking to be recognized as refugees.
 The Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Public Security, and Civil Affairs, in collaboration
 with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), are writing
 legislation that would allow China to honor its obligation as a party since 1982 to
 the 1967 protocol relative to the status of refugees.
 Although the Government denies having tightened its policy on accepting Viet-
 namese refugees, in recent years very few such refugees have actually been reset-
 tled in China. According to the UNHCR, from 1989 to 1992 China granted admis-
 sion and provided resettlement to about 130 Vietnamese refugees who came to
 China to reunite with their families and gave temporary refuge to 35 Vietnamese
 who subsequently settled in third countries. There were credible reports that larger
 numbers of Vietnamese have remained in China without official harassment. China
 has cooperated with Hong Kong to reduce the flow of Vietnamese refugees into the
 colony. China has not participated in the Comprehensive Plan of Action negotiated
 at the International Conference on Indochinese Refugees in 1989 but generally has
 abided by its principles.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens lack the means to change their government legally and can not freely
 choose or change the laws and officials that govern them. Citizens vote directly only
 for county-level people's congress delegates. People's congress delegates at the pro-
 vincial level are selected by county-level people's congresses, and in turn provincial-
 level people's congsses select delegates to the National People's Congress. Accord-
 ing to the 1982 Constitution, the National People's Congress (NPC) is the highest
 organ of state power. It elects the President and Vice President, decides on the
 choice of the Premier, and elects the Chairman of the Central Military Commission.
 
 
 The election and agenda of the NPC are under the tight control of the Communist
 Party.
 In some elections, voters are offered more candidates than positions, allowing a
 modest degree of choice among officially approved candidates. There were credible
 reports in 1993 that the candidates most favored by authorities were defeated in
 a handful of county-level elections and in at least two elections of governors by pro-
 vincial people's congresses.
 As is the case with the NPC, the election and agenda of people's congresses at
 other levels also remain under tight control by the Communist Party, the para-
 mount source of political authority in China. The Constitution was amended in 1993
 to ratify the existence of small "democratic" parties, but these play only a minor
 consultative role at most, and all pledge allegiance to the Communist Party. Thus,
 the Communist Party retains an explicit monopoly on political decision-making. The
 requirement that associations register and be approved makes it difficult for inde-
 pendent interest groups to form and affect the system. Within the Communist
 Party, a closed inner circle of a few senior leaders reserves the right to set ultimate
 policy directions. Some hold key positions within the standing committee of the Po-
 litbur, the Central Military Commssion, or other organs, while others who are
 nominally retired wield great influence on at least selected issues.
 Reversing previous moves to separate the party and government apparatus, at the
 National People's Congss in April General   ecretarJiang Zemin and several
 other senior party members were named to hold concurrent government positions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no independent Chinese organizations that publicly monitor or com-
 ment on human rights conditions in China. The Government has made it clear it
 will not tolerate the existence of such groups. Authorities in Shanghai took no action
 on a March application by several persons to register a proposed "human rights as-
 sociation.    ic rticism of the Government's human rights record can be inter-
 preted as "counterrevolutionary" activity and punished accordingly.
 Limited academic study and discussion of concepts of human rights have been
 promoted since 1991. Research institutes in Shanghai and Beijing, including the
 Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, have organized symposia on human rights, es-
 tablished human rights research centers, and visited other nations to study human
 rights practices in these countries. Such activities appear to have originated in a
 desire to improve China's image abroad and strengthen the Government's ability to
 respond to criticism of its human rights record. Whatever the motivation, this proc-
 ess of study and dialog has exposed more Chinese to international standards and
 concepts of human rights. Three official White Papers on human rights subjects
 were published in 1991 and 1992. While the reports stridently defended Chinese
 practices and glossed over fundamental problems, they sparked a limited debate
 among academic experts on human rights problems in China that continued in
 1993.
 Despite the Government's professed adherence to the United Nations Charter,
 which mandates respect for and promotion of human rights, Chinese officials accept
 only in theory the principle that human rights are universal. They argue that each
 nation has its own concept of human rights, grounded in its political, economic, and
 social system and its historical, religious, and cultural background. China was ac-
 tive in international forums, including the World Conference on Human Rights in
 June and the annual U.N. Commission on Human Rights meeting in February, in
 support of this view and to deflect attempts to discuss China's human rights record.
 China remains reluctant to accept criticism of its human rights situation by other
 nations or international organizations. Its officials often criticized reports by inter-
 national human rights monitoring groups, as well as past Department of State re-
 ports on human rights practices in China. By and large, Chinese officials continue
 to insist that criticism of China's human rights practices constitutes interference in
 China's internal affairs. Nevertheless, in 1993 Chinese authorities expanded their
 dialog with foreign governments on human rights issues in talks with a number of
 visiting delegations from the United States and other countries and also during vis-
 its abroad by Chinese leaders.
 Chinese authorities have refused most requests by foreign human rights delega-
 tions to meet with political prisoners but did allow U.S. human rights officials to
 visit Yuio Dawa Tsering in Drapchi prison in Lhasa in October. Representatives of
 some international human rights gruups visited China in 1993 but did so in an indi-
 vidual capacity and did not engage in an official dialog with the Government. A pri-
 vate American human rights monitor, however, did meet with midranking govern-
 ment officials on several occasions to discuss specific human rights cases.
 
 
 615
 Finally, while China has continued to engage in a human rights dialog with for-
 eign critics, it has consistently taken the position that human rights practices
 should be assessed not on the basis of universal principles but rather in the context
 of local economic, political, and cultural conditions. The Government also maintains
 that human rights issues are internal matters and that external intervention on
 human rights issues constitutes interference with its sovereignty.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 While laws exist to protect minorities and women, in practice discrimination
 based on ethnicity, sex, and religion has persisted. Minorities however, do benefit
 from an official policy of "privileged treatment" in marriage policy, family planning,
 university admission, and employment, as well as from disproportionate infrastruc-
 ture investment in some minority areas.
 Women.-The 1982 Constitution states that "women in the People's Republic of
 China enjoy equal rights with men in all spheres of life" and promises, among other
 things, equal pay for equal work. In fact, most women employed in industry work
 in lower s illed and lower paid jobs. Women hold relatively few positions of signifi-
 cant influence within the party or government structure. Persistent problems have
 remained with regard to the status of women, who have often been the unintended
 victims of reforms designed to streamline enterprises and give workers greater job
 mobility. Many employers prefer to hire men to avoid the expense of maternity leave
 and child care.
 Reports by women of discrimination, sexual harassment, unfair dismissal, demo-
 tion, and wage cuts have continued. In 1992 the NPC enacted legislation on the pro-
 tection of the rights and interests of women designed to assist in curbing these
 types of sex-related discrimination. While the gap in the education levels of men and
 women is narrowing, men continue to constitute the majority of the educated class,
 particularly the highly educated.
 The Government continued in 1993 to condemn strongly and take steps to prevent
 and punish the abduction and sale of women for wives and prostitutes, abuse of fe-
 male children, violence against women, and female infanticide. It has severely pun-
 ished a number of people accused of such crimes. No nationwide statistics were
 available on the extent of physical violence against women. A May study on family
 violence reported that in Shanghai from 29 to 33 percent of domestic disputes from
 1991-92 involved physical violence. In another 1993 study on the social status of
 women, 21.2 percent of urban wives and 31.4 percent of rural wives said there was
 frequent or occasional violence during family quarrels. The abduction of women re-
 mains a serious problem in some areas where local officials have resisted efforts of
 central authorities to stop it. Many discriminatory practices are rooted in traditional
 rural attitudes which highly value boys as prospective earners and as future care-
 takers for elderly parents. A number of provinces have sought to reduce the per-
 ceived higher economic value of boys in providing old age support by establishing
 or improving pensions and retirement homes.
 In many areas, the ready availability of sonograms has facilitated selective abor-
 tion of female fetuses, contributing to a growing gap in the ratio of reported male
 and female births. Insistence that local units meet population goals exacerbates the
 problem, since traditional-minded parents often wish to ensure they have one or
 more sons without incurring official penalties. The Government has condemned sex-
 selective abortion and stated it is tightening access to sonogram results.
 Children.-China does not condone violence against children, and physical abuse
 can be grounds for criminal prosecution. In January 1992, China passed a national
 law on the protection of juveniles. According to Chinese media, China's infant mor-
 tality rate has declined to 45 per 1,000 live births, severe malnutrition among chil-
 dren under 5 years of age has been "virtually eliminated," 95 percent of children
 have received immunizations, and primary school enrollment is at 97 percent. In
 January an English-language magazine reported on the problem of child abuse, not-
 ing that physical punishment was widespread, citing four cases from 1992 where
 children died from abuse. According to one study from Zhejiang province, 60 percent
 of 200 children surveyed said they would be beaten if they did not do well in school.
 In addition, Chinese officials indicated in October that there were about 200,000
 homeless children in China out of a total of 300 million children under age 18.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The 55 designated ethnic minorities con-
 stitute just over 8 percent of China's total population. Most minority groups reside
 in areas they have traditionally inhabited, witi standards of living often well below
 the national average. Government development policies have helped raise minority
 living standards but have at the same time disrupted traditional living patterns.
 The Dalai Lama continued to state his concern in 1993 that the Government's plan
 
 
 616
 to develop Tibet's economy would lead to a massive influx into Tibet of Han Chi-
 nese. Tens of thousands of non-Tibetan entrepreneurs without residence permits
 have come to Lhasa, capital of Tibet, to engage in business.
 In some instances, the Government has tried to adopt policies responsive to mi-
 nority sensitivities but in doing so has encountered the dilemma of how to respect
 minority cultures without damaging minority educational and economic opportuni-
 ties. In Tibet and Xinjiang, for example, there are two-track school systems using
 standard Chinese and minority languages. Students may choose which system to at-
 tend. One acknowledged side effect of this policy to protect and maintain minority
 cultures has been reinforcement of a segregated society. Under this separate edu-
 cation system, those graduating from minority schools are at a disadvantage in com-
 Seting for obs, which require good spoken Chinese, in government and business.
 These graduates must take remedial language instruction before attending univer-
 sities and colleges.
 The Communist Party has an avowed policy of boosting minority representation
 in the Government and the party, and a few members of minorities occupy local and
 national leadership positions. However, ethnic minorities are effectively shut out of
 most positions of real political and decisionmaking power. Some minorities resent
 Han officials holding key positions in minority autonomous regions. Ethnic minori-
 ties in Tibet, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and elsewhere have demonstrated against Han Chi-
 neae authority, but central authorities have made it clear that they will not tolerate
 opposition to Beijing's rule in minority regions.
 People with Disabilities.-There is no legislation to ensure that buildings, even
 new ones, are accessible to those with handicaps. A State Council committee was
 established in October to coordinate policy toward the disabled under China's 1990
 law on the handicapped. The results of the eighth 5-year plan for handicappedpeo-
 pie, which ended in 1992, were discussed in October; schools for the disabled in-
 creased from 400 in 1988 to 1,000 in 1992, and special education increased six-fold.
 But according to the Disabled Person's Federation, only 6 percent of disabled school-
 age children are receiving primary education. There are 40,000 welfare enterprises
 nationwide providing work for the handicapped, and 1.26 million have benefited
 from rehabilitation projects. Concern that the disabled will lose jobs as enterprises
 emphasize productivity has led to the creation of a pilot project in which all state
 enterprises will be required to hire a certain number of disabled workers. The
 handicapped still suffer from social isolation, especially in rural areas, and some
 handicapped children are given to orphanages. At the end of December, the Govern-
 ment announced plans to adopt a new law on eugenics, but specifics of the law were
 not available at year's end.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-China's 1982 Constitution provides for "freedom of
 association," but the guarantee is heavily diluted by references to the interest of the
 State and the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The country's sole offi-
 cially recognized workers' organization, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
 (ACFTU), ostensibly independent, is in fact controlled by the Communist Party.
 Independent trade unions are illegal. Though union officials recognize that workers'
 interests may not always coincide with those of the Communist Party, the Union
 Law passed by the National People's Congress in March 1992 states that the union
 is a party organ and its primary purpose is to mobilize workers for national develop-
 ment. The 1993 revised Trade Union Law requires that the establishment of unions
 at any level be submitted to a higher level trade union organization for approval.
 The ACFTU is the highest such organization, and it has not approved the establish-
 ment of any independent unions. While the foreign press has reported that some
 exist, because of severe repression they operate only deep within the shadows. The
 vast majority of workers have no contact with any union other than the ACFTU.
 There are no provisions allowing for individual workers or unofficial worker organi-
 zations to affiliate with international bodies.
 The ACFTU's primay attention remains focused on its traditional constituency,
 state sector workers. The Trade Union Law mandates that workers may decide
 whether to join the union in their enterprise. By official estimate, 10 percent of
 workers in collectively and state-owned enterprises have chosen for their own rea-
 sons not to join. There have been no reports of repercussions for workers who have
 not joined ACFTU unions. Diversification of enterprise types over the last decade
 of reform has vastly increased the number of workers outside this traditional sphere
 of the ACFTU. In fact, over half of China's nonagricultural work force is now largely
 nonunion and outside the state industrial structure-in collectives, village and
 township enterprises, private and individual enterprises, and foreign-invested enter-
 prises. In township and village enterprises, one of the fastest growing sectors of the
 
 
 617
 economy, only one-tenth of 1 percent of workers are unionized. Unemployed workers
 are not considered union members.
 Workers in companies with foreign investors are guaranteed the right to form
 unions, which then must affiliate with the ACFTU. According to Ministry of Labor
 national statistics, 30 percent of foreign-invested companies now have unions. Other
 official estimates show that about 10,000 trade unions with a total of 500,000 mem-
 bers have been established in the nearly 20,000 foreign-funded companies in
 Guangdong province. However, a 1993 embassy survey of foreign-invested ventures
 in Bering indicated the unionization rate diminished from 60 percent in 1991 to 40
 percent in 1993.
 The right to strike, which had been included in China's 1975 and 1978 constitu-
 tions, was not retained in the 1982 Constitution. In general, the union law passed
 in 1992 assigned unions the role of mediators or go-betweens with management in
 cases of work stoppages or slowdowns. Nonetheless, well-documented work stop-
 pages occurred in several locations in China during 1993. There were two highly
 visible strikes in Guangdong's Zhuhai City, namely a 3-day strike over wages at a
 joint-venture camera factory and a work stoppage at a joint-venture electrical com-
 ponents factory. Ministry of Labor officials broke with their past practice of denying
 the existence of strikes in China by giving details about recent strikes in Tianjin
 and Xian. Strikes in 11 foreign-invested enterprises in Tianjin were widely reported
 in the Chinese press. One particularly high profile case involved a foreign-owned
 footwear factory at which 1,200 workers struck over por working conditions and al-
 leged mistreatment of several of the workers by the management. The 11 enter-
 pnses were held up as examples of disregard for local regulations by foreigners and
 indications of the need to establish unions in foreign-invested enterprises. Strikes
 were uniformly resolved in favor of workers, and enterprises were required to bring
 facilities up to regulatory standards. Ministry of Labor officials have not provided
 any statistics on how many strikes occurred in 1993, but one Hong Kong newspaper
 reported that in the first half of 1993 there were 190 strikes and protests across
 China involving about 50,000 workers. It is not possible to determine the validity
 of this estimate.
 Credible reports by foreign human rights organizations indicate that the Govern-
 ment has attempted to stamp out all clandestine union activity and that independ-
 ent unions and worker groups feature prominently in lists of illegal organizations.
 In May four men were detained and later formally arrested for the crime of organiz-
 ing a counterrevolutionary organization, the Shanghai Autonomous Workers Federa-
 tion. Two of these men were released in early September. As noted in Section 2.d.,
 labor activists Han Donfan  and Lu Jinghua have been refused reentry to China.
 The International Confederaion of F   Trade Unions (ICFTU) alleges that in May
 and June of 1992 the Public Security Bureau (PSB) secretly arrested activists of the
 clandestine China Free Trade Union Preparatory Committee and appeared to have
 dismantled this org[anization. On May 15 another clandestine union group, the Free
 Trade Union of China, issued a manifesto. Preemptive arrests took place just before
 the June 4 Tiananmen anniversary. These included seven members of the clandes-
 tine Liberal Workers Union detained by the PSB to prevent them from circulating
 commemorative leaflets. Accurate figures on the number of Worker Autonomous
 Federation detainees still beingheld after the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstra-
 tions are not available. The ICFtu alleges that hundreds of workers are still being
 held.
 In response to an ICFTU complaint, the Governing Body of the International
 Labor Or    manization (ILO) in March requested that the Government modify 'many
 provisionst of the Trade Union Act that are contrary to the principle of freedom of
 association, expressed concern at the severity of sanctions pronounced by the courts
 against members or leaders of Workers' Autonomous Federations, and asked that
 detained workers be released.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Under a 1988 law and cur-
 rent re  lations, collective bargaining is permitted only  workers in private enter-
 rises which employ less than 3 percent of workers). There have been no reports
 of collective bargaining actually taking place. Most private enterprises are small and
 nonunionized. Thus far, without legal status as a collective bargaining body, the
 ACF  s role has been limited to consultations with management over wages and
 regulations affecting labor and working conditions and efforts to serve as a conduit
 for communicating workers' complaints to the management of enterprises or munici-
 pal labor bureaus. The ACF U has shown itself concerned with protecting workers'
 living standards in areas such as unemployment insurance.
 Be ore wage reform, workers' salaries were set according to a uniform national
 scale based on seniority and skills. Following wage reforms, a total wage bill for
 each collectively and state-owned enterprise is set by the Ministry of Labor accord-
 
 
 618
 ing to four criteria: 1) As a percentage of profits, 2) as a contract amount with the
 local labor bureau, 3) for money losing enterprises, according to a state-set amount,
 and 4) as an enterprise-set amount subject to ministry review. Individual enter-
 prises determine how to divide the total among the workers, a decision usually
 made by the enterprise manager in consultation with the enterprise party chief and
 the union representative. Worker congresses have mandated authority to review
 plans for wage reform, though these bodies serve primarily as rubber stamp organi-
 zations. Wages are generally equal for the same type of work within enterprises. In-
 centives are provided for increased productivity.
 The old permanent employment system is giving way to a more flexible contract-
 based system. However, the percentage of workers laboring under contract is still
 low, approximately 40 percent nationwide in state enterprises. Under the Labor
 Contract System, individual workers may negotiate with management over contract
 terms. In practice, only the very few workers with highly technical skills are able
 to negotiate effectively on salary and fringe benefits issues.
 Worker congresses, held periodically in most Chinese enterprises, theoretically
 have the authority to remove incompetent managers and approve major decisions
 affecting the enterprise, notably wage and bonus distribution systems. However,
 worker congresses generally take place once a year and serve essentially to
 rubberstamp agreements worked out among factory managers, party secretaries,
 and union representatives. In smaller enterprises it is not unusual to find these
 three posts held by the same person.
 A dispute settlement procedure has been in effect since 1987. The procedure pro-
 vides for two levels of arbitration committees and a final appeal to the courts. Of
 the 50,000 cases brought for arbitration in 1992, most were resolved at the first or
 second level, with less than 5 percent reaching the courts. According to Labor Min-
 istry officials, most arbitration cases are filedby contract workers or their employ-
 ers, an indication, they assert, that the new contract system provides a clearer set
 of gund rules which both sides can attempt to enforce.
 aws governing working conditions in China's special economic zones (SEZ's) are
 not significantly different from those in the rest of the country. However, wages in
 the SEZ's are significantly higher than in other Chinese enterprises. Unskilled la-
 borers can expect much higher pay in southern China generally, but highly skilled
 workers are the main beneficiaries of the wage discrepancy.
 The 1982 Trade Union Law prohibits antiunion discrimination and specifies that
 union representatives may not be transferred or terminated by enterpise manage-
 ment during their term of office. Unionized foreign businesses generally report prag-
 matic relations with ACFTU representatives. The ACFTU's stated goal is to estab-
 lish unions in all foreign-funded enterprises within 2 to 3 years.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Chinese penal policy emphasizes
 "reform first, production second," but compulsory labor is an integral part of the sys-
 tem both to rehabilitate prisoners and to help support the facilities. Almost all per-
 sons the courts sentence to prison, including political prisoners, are required to
 work, usually for little or no compensation. China also maintains a network of "re-
 education through labor" camps (see Section I.e.), the inmates of which generally
 must work. Reports from human rights organizations and released prisoners dem-
 onstrate that at least some persons in pretrial detention are also required to work.
 The number of workers in prison for nonviolent labor-related activity is not known.
 (See Section i.e.) According to prison authorities, prisoners in labor reform institu-
 tions work a full 8-hour day and must also engage in both ideological and basic lit-
 eracy and skills training Justice officials have stated that in labor reeducation fa-
 cilities there is a much heavier emphasis on education than on labor. Most reports
 conclude that work conditions in the penal system's light manufacturing factories
 are similar to those in ordinary factories, but conditions on farms and in mines can
 be harsh. As is the case nationwide, safety is often neglected, putting prisoners at
 risk, but there were no available figures for casualties in prison industry.
 Some penal facilities contract with regular industries for prisoners to perform
 light manufacturing and assembly work. In 1992 Chinese newspapers reported that
 Chinese prison labor is used for many types of production (examples in paren-
 theses), including heavy industry (coal, steel), light manufacturing (clothing, shoes,
 small machine tools), and agriculture (grain, tea, sugar cane). In 1991 the Chinese
 Government published a reiteration of its regulations barring the export of prison-
 made goods. On August 7, 1992, the U.S. and Chinese Governments signed a memo-
 randum of understanding (MOU) prohibiting trade in prison labor products. The
 U.S. Customs Service has issued detention orders barring a number of products re-
 portedly made by prisoners from entering the United States and detained several
 shipments of such goods in 1993. Under the MOU the Chinese have provided re-
 quested investigation reports on 31 suspected facilities. Five facilities investigated
 
 
 619
 
 by the Chinese were found to have had prisoners engaged in some aspect 6f export
 production at some point in time, though not necessarily to the United States; of
 these, two with export activities at the time of the investigation reportedly received
 unspecified adminstrative sanctions. U.S. officials have conducted on-site visits of
 three suspected facilities and another facility visit has already been scheduled. The
 detention orders on two of the visited facilities were lifted, one in December 1993
 and one in January 1994. The other case is still under study.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Regulations promulgated in 1987
 prohibit the employment of school age minors who have not completed the compul-
 sory 9 years of education. Press reports indicate that dropout rates for lower second-
 ary schools (ages 12-15 years) in several southern provinces exceed 9 percent (the
 national average is 2.2 percent). This suggests the booming economy in that region
 is enticing more children to leave their studies to find jobs. In poorer, isolated areas,
 child labor in agriculture is widespread. Most independent observers agree with Chi-
 nese officials that China's urban child labor problem is relatively minor. No specific
 Chinese industry is identifiable as a significant violator of child labor regulations.
 In 1991 the State Council issued regulations imposing severe fines, withdrawal of
 business licenses, or jail for empoyers who hire laborers under 16 years of age.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-China does not have a labor code. A draf has
 been circulating since mid-1992. Due to the complexity of incorporating myriad ex-
 isting regulations into the proposed unified code, it remains unclear if it will be
 made law. Labor regulations continue to be promulgated at both the national and
 provincial level, but they are not uniformly enforced.
 There is no minimum wage in China. However, the Ministry of Labor is currently
 drafting minimum wage regulations. Anticipating the issuance of the regulations,
 some local governments particularly those in more highly developed east coast
 areas, have already drafted regulations on minimum wages. On the higher end, in
 Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, the minimum monthly wage has been set at $62 (350
 yuan at the official exchange rate). Generally the levels have been set to provide
 for a decent standard of living for a worker and his family. Minimum wage figures
 do not include free or heavily subsidized benefits which employing work units com-
 monly provide in kind such as housing, medical care, and education. Factories or
 ministries are required to pay 70 percent of final monthly wages to workers laid off
 because of a factory closing or reduction in force, but there have been numerous re-
 ports of violations of this policy.
 The national standard workweek, excluding overtime, is 48 hours with a manda-
 tory 24-hour rest period. In the past, 3 to 12 working hours per week were generally
 spent in political study or "education" on current social issues. In recent years,
 many factories have abandoned political study either for regular work or for an ad-
 ditional half day off each week. Starting in 1991, factories (including joint ventures)
 were allowed to adopt shorter workweeks. Despite laws mandating a standard 8-
 hour workday throughout the country, there continue to be reports of workers in
 the SEZ's regularly working 12 hours daily.
 Occupational health and safety are constant themes of posters and campaigns.
 Every work unit must designate a health and safety officer and the International
 Labor Organization has established a training program for these officials. Moreover,
 while the right to strike is not provided for in the 1982 Constitution, the Trade
 Union Law explicitly recognizes the right of unions to "suggest that staff and work-
 ers withdraw from sites of danger" and to participate in accident investigations.
 Labor officials reported that such withdrawals did occur sometimes in 1993. None-
 theless, pressures for increased output, lack of financial resources to maintain
 equipment, lack of concern by management, and a traditionally poor understanding
 of safety issues by workers have contributed to a continuing high rate of accidents.
 State prosecutors deal annually with thousands of negligence and accident cases. In
 November 1992, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed
 a law on mining safety, which established standards and provided for enforcement,
 including fines and imprisonment. Labor officials were unable to provide statistics
 verifying the effects oft  law, but they claimed that despite substantially increased
 across-the-board production in mining output, mine accidents were down in the first
 half of 1993.
 More than 15,000 workers died in industrial accidents in 1992, 63 percent of them
 miners. Because of the lack of legislation to bring together diverse and often
 unpublished regulations in other health and safety areas, compliance with existing
 regulations is ha p hazard. Official Chinese press reports in July announced the issu-
 ance of a State Council circular stressing safety in production following "sharp in-
 creases in job accidents in the first half of this year." Officials blame the increases
 on lax enforcement of safety regulations in the rapidly expanding rural, foreign-
 funded, and private industry sectors.

 As fires and explosions in southern China amply demonstrated in 1993, enforce-
 ment of China's safety regulations, particularly in the booming light industry sector,
 continued to be lax. In late November, 81 workers died in a blaze in a Shenzhen
 toy factory because safety precautions were not taken and warnings from the local
 labor ministry office had allegedly gone unheeded.
