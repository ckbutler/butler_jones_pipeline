 MEXICO
 -Mexico is a federal republic which has been dominated by the
 Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) since its founding in
 1929. Recent political reforms have expanded the opposition's
 role and stake in the political system. A diverse political
 opposition currently holds a significant number of seats in
 congress, two major governorships, and numerous mayoralties.
 Nevertheless, the PRI has maintained its predominant political
 control by a combination of voting strength, organizational
 power, access to governmental resources not enjoyed by other
 political parties, and, the principal opposition parties and
 other credible observers charge, electoral irregularities.
 In the summer of 1991, midterm elections were held for all
 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, for one-half the Senate, and
 for 7 governorships. In much of Mexico, the PRI gained
 significantly more votes than in 1988, winning nationally with
 a wide margin over its nearest competitor. Many political
 analysts attributed the PRI's improved showing to popular
 support for the reform programs, particularly economic
 modernization, advocated by President Salinas. However,
 opposition leaders and many respected nonpartisan observers,
 both domestic and international, cited a variety of actions by
 election authorities and PRI supporters that they charged had
 distorted the outcome of races in several states. In the cases
 of the races for governor in Guanajuato and San Luis Potosi,
 the Government responded to chat-ges of-egregious fraud by
 forcing the PRI candidates who had been declared victorious by
 state electoral commissions to withdraw, replacing them with
 interim governors pending new elections.
 Mexican security forces include federal and state judicial
 police, specialized forces such as Mexico City's traffic
 police,'the federal highway police, and the military. Members
 of the Federal Judicial Police (MFJP), especially antinarcotics
 personnel, continue to be responsible for most human rights
 abuses, including torture, unlawful arrest, and abuse of
 authority. Some analysts charge that police brutality is
 widespread in Mexico, but according to the NationalCommission
 on Human Rights (CNDH), as well as some state and local human -
 rights advocates, allegations of such abuse declined in 1991.
 Analysts attribute this decline primarily to significant legal
 reforms that took effect in February and to the Government's
 efforts to begin prosecuting some officials as offenders.
 -Mexico has a mixed economy that combines domestic market
 capitalism with increasingly reduced state ownership of major
 industries. The Government's economic reform progam has been
 very successful in reducing inflation, promoting growth, and
 restoring economic confidence. Negotiations continue for a
 Free Trade Agreement with Canada and the United States.
 Increased confidence in Mexico abroad has led to record levels
 of foreign investment.
 A wide range of individual freedoms is provided for by the
 Constitution and honored in practice, but there continue to be
 human rights abuses. These include the use of torture and
 other abuse by elements of the police, instances of
 extrajudicial killing, and credible charges by opposition
 parties, civic groups, and outside observers of election
 irregularities in some races. Throughout the year, however,
 the Salinas Administration continued its serious efforts to
 promote human rights. As of December, 139 police and other
 public employees had been disciplined as a result of 158
 recommendations by the CNDH, and criminal charges were pending
 
 
 665
 MEXICO
 against 64 of them. Nevertheless, many human rights abuses
 still go unpunished. Both President Salinas and the CNDH
 acknowledge that much remains to be done to improve respect for
 human rights and to eliminate the culture of impunity that has
 traditionally surrounded human rights violators.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Several killings of political and human rights activists
 occurred in 1991. As in previous years, the identities and
 motives of the perpetrators often could not be shown
 conclusively for lack of evidence, but a number of the killings
 may have been politically motivated. Most public attention in
 1991 was focused on the murder in July of Victor Manuel
 Oropeza, a doctor and columnist in Juarez who often denounced
 human rights abuses committed by government officials (see
 Section 2.a.). Two suspects who were arrested and confessed to
 the crime later recanted, claiming they had been beaten and
 tortured into confessing by federal and state police
 officials. The suspects remained in detention, although a
 judicial inquiry into the investigation of the case was pending
 at year's end.
 There appeared to be less electoral violence in the August
 elections than in most previous Mexican elections.
 Nonetheless, a Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) mayor
 in Michoacan was shot dead several days after the election by
 an inebriated'assailant apparently driven by partisan feeling.
 A PRI mayoral precandidate was slain before the election in
 rural Veracruz, and the son of a National Action Party (PAN)
 federal deputy was shot at on election day while working for
 the party.
 There continued to be incidents of extrajudicial killing by
 MFJP agents. In December 1990, MFJP agents killed 8 people in
 Angostura, Sinaloa, in an ambush intended to net drug smugglers
 who eluded capture. In November 1991, the six policemen
 involved were convicted of homicide and sentenced to terms of
 from 16 to 18 years. The body of Francisco Quijano Garcia was
 identified in March 1991. Quijano disappeared in June 1990
 after he had pressed for an inquiry into the shooting deaths of
 -three of his sons at the hands of police in January 1990. The
 CNDH's investigation into the sons' deaths implicated MFJP
 agents, and the commission issued a recommendation that the
 incident be investigated. After the Attorney General's first
 investigation left unanswered questions, the'CNDH sought
 further information and said its own investigation would
 continue. As of year's end, the CNDH was awaiting the results
 of a study by independent forensic specialists before giving
 its views on the case. In September 1991, the Government
 announced the arrest of former MFJP Commander Mario Alberto
 Gonzalez Trevino, who allegedly contracted for the 1990 murder
 of lawyer and prominent human rights worker Norma Corona.
 Trevino's trial for murder was pending at year's end. Although
 no suspects have been arrested, investigations continue into
 the deaths of Hector Felix, a journalist and police critic who
 was killed in 1988, and also into the 1988 slayings of two
 senior aides to PRD leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas.
 
 
 666
 MEXICO
 In Mexico's rural states, violent disputes over land sometimes
 --result in extrajudicial killings. Paramilitary bands and local
 police controlled by political bosses and land owners have
 threatened and sometimes killed peasant activists. A violent
 confrontation in November near Acapulco, Guerrero, reportedly
 caused by developers trying to evict peasants from a tract of
 land, resulted in several injuries and at least two deaths.
 In 1991 there was an increase in the number of police officials
 disciplined for human rights abuses, principally as a result of
 CNDH investigations and recommendations. Cooperation with the
 CZNDH by the Attorney General's office, which has jurisdiction
 over the MFJP, improved after Ignacio Morales Lechuga, the new
 Attorney General, took office in May. The investigative power
 of the CNDH was substantially strengthened in 1991 by a change
 in the federal law that requires government employees to
 respond to information requests by the CNDH in a timely and
 truthful manner. Morales Lechuga later promulgated an internal
 office rule ordering unrestricted access for CNDH investigators
 and prompt, full replies to requests for information.
 b. Disappearance
 The CNDH investigated the 54 reports of disappearance it
 received from January through December, 1991. In addition, on
 its own initiative the CNDH investigated 154 other cases as
 part of a joint program with the Attorney General's office to
 investigate every case in Mexico listed by the U.N. Working
 Group on Involuntary or Forced Disappearances. (The U.N. list
 contains a total of more than 200 persons who reportedly
 disappeared in Mexico over the last 22 years. Mexican
 independant human rights groups continue to claim that
 approximately 500 persons disappeared in Mexico over the same
 period.) As of its December 1991 report on the program, the
 CNDH had concluded 40 cases, 16 concerning claimed
 disappearances from 1973-1989 and 24 from the period
 1989-1991. Of the 40 concluded cases, 30 persons were found
 alive and 6 dead (including 1 who drowned and 5 who were
 apparently murdered. One murder suspect is in custody.)
 Investigations of the other four concluded cases were closed at
 the request of family members or for lack of evidence that the
 person had disappeared. According to the Commission, of the 24
 disappearances from 1989-1991 that it resolved, there was some
 evidence of a political motive in 1 case, that of Jose Ramon
 Garcia Gomez. The Commission has issued a recommendation in
 his case and its investigation continues. Of the cases
 concluded after the subject was found alive, many had been
 imprisoned and charged with minor offenses, then released and
 had not returned home, while others moved for personal reasons.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by the Constitution. However, police
 agents continue to employ psychological and physical torture,
 and this form of abuse is a significant human rights concern in
 Mexico. The most commonly used methods of torture include
 threats, beatings, asphyxiation, and electric shock. In its
 first 18 months of operation, the CNDH received 602 complaints
 of torture out of 5,741 complaints of human rights violations.
 According to the CNDH, however, complaints of torture declined
 during the course of 1991 and during the second semester
 represented 6.2 percent of complaints filed. Through
 September, 60 U.S. citizens complained of police abuse, a
 decline of 37 compared to the same period in 1990. In the
 
 
 667
 MEXICO
 majority of cases, where victims were able to identify those
 involved, MFJP agents were implicated, although the share of
 cases involving local and state authorities increased. By
 year's end, the U.S. Government formally protested 27 cases of
 torture or other mistreatment through diplomatic channels, down
 from 43 such protests in 1990. According to the Attorney
 General's reports, investigation of U.S. protests in 1991
 resulted in 9 dismissals, 59 suspensions, and 20 reprimands of
 officials found to have been involved. While criminal
 investigations into the nine dismissed officials were
 continuing, none had been prosecuted by year's end.
 The Government continued efforts begun in 1990 to reduce the
 incidence of torture and similar abuse by officials. Since
 June 1991, the Government investigated, suspended, and/or fired
 137 agents of municipal, state, and federal police forces, in
 response to CNDH investigations, and 64 were prosecuted. The
 charges against these 64 include 10 of homicide, 13 of torture
 16 of wounding, and 6 of unlawful detention. A total of 143
 charges are pending against the 64.
 In response to frequent criticism that confessions are coerced
 in the period before defendants appear before a judge and are
 assigned a lawyer, the federal rules of evidence were amended
 in February. Confessions are now inadmissible unless given
 before a judge or a Public Ministry official and in the
 presence of defense counsel or a person in whom the accused has
 confidence. Similar changes have been adopted in several state
 codes and are being considered in the rest. The new rule is
 credited by the CNDH and independent human rights activists as
 partly responsible for-the apparent decline in the incidence of
 torture in 1991. But some human rights groups argue that-
 torture is still-widespread and that the new rule does not go
 far enough. They'assert that only confessions before judges
 should be accepted. Continued investigation of complaints
 combined with vigorous prosecution and severe sentences are
 needed to eliminate the practice of torture and other abuse of
 detainees and prisoners.
 Most prisons in Mexico are overcrowded and lack adequate
 facilities for the prisoners. In addition, an-entrenched
 system of corruption has undermined prison authority and led to
 abuses. In May a prison riot in Matamoros was sparked by a
 conflict between prisoners involved in the drug trade. After
 the riot, both prison officials and police officers were
 dismissed and charged with collusion. The CNDH has advocated
 legislation, before Congress at year's end, reducing the number
 of crimes that carry mandatory prison sentences and giving
 judges more discretion to sentence defendants to-fines and
 supervised release instead of prison terms.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution requires that arrestees be brought before a
 judge within 24 hours of arrest, and that the judge take from
 them a prelimiary declaration within the following 48 hours.
 Within 72 hours after the arrestee first appears before him,
 the judge must decide whether or not the detention shall
 continue.- Police and judges often fail to meet these
 constitutional and procedural deadlines.
 Incidents of arbitrary arrest and imprisonment occur
 frequently: CNDH figures show that illegal deprivation of
 liberty is the most common complaint among its human rights
 cases. From June 1990 to December 1991, out of 5,741
 
 
 668
 MEXICO
 complaints received by the CNDH, 624 alleged arbitrary
 detention. The most notorious arbitrary arrest case in 1991
 involved Antonio Francisco Valencia Fontes, the lawyer of
 Sergio Machi Ramirez who, according to the CNDH, may have been
 abducted by MFJP agents in November 1989. After the CNDH
 issued a recommendation calling for the release of Valencia
 Fontes, the trial judge dismissed the case for lack of
 evidence.
 The law permits suspects caught in the act of committing a
 crime (flagrancia) to be arrested with a warrant. It has been
 frequent police practice to arrest a suspect without a warrant
 even when there is no flagrancia and for judges to overlook the
 irregularity. That practice has only recently begun to abate
 with the dismissal of several cases based on arrests without
 proof of flagrancia. In order for the protection against
 arbitrary arrest to be given full effect, human rights
 advocates assert that defense counsel must regularly raise the
 issue and judges must be prepared to recognize it.
 Credible reports continue to be made of human rights
 violations, including forced expulsions and unlawful arrests,
 in connection with land disputes in rural areas. These
 incidents often involve indigenous people evicted by landowners
 with local police and government support. In the spring
 hundreds of people were expelled from their houses in Paso
 Achiote, Chiapas, by local police and agents of the landowner.
 Those evicted had returned by year's end, but several were
 arbitrarily arrested and held for months before their release.
 Local human rights activists credit their release to the
 intervention of the Federal Government, publicity, and
 demonstrations of domestic and international support. In
 another case, the alleged violent occupation of another lot in
 Chiapas led to the imprisonment of a local priest who had
 supported the Paso Achiote arrestees. The priest was held over
 for trial by a judge who did not believe evidence that the
 priest was not present.at the time of the incident. On
 November 6, the priest was released following a national and
 international outcry by religious and human rights groups, and
 after an investigation by the CNDH.
 Exile and extradition of Mexican citizens are not normally
 practiced in Mexico.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system is divided into federal and state court
 systems, with the federal courts having jurisdiction over most
 civil cases and those involving major felonies, including drug
 trafficking. The political opposition charges that the
 judiciary, with judges placed in office by renewable
 appointments, is dependent on the  xecutive branch. The
 Government, in turn, denies that political beliefs have any
 bearing on the impartial administration of justice. Factors
 such as low pay and high caseloads contribute to continued
 corruption within the judicial system.
 The Constitution requires that the court must hand down a
 decision within 4 months of arrest for crimes that carry a
 maximum sentence of 2 years or less, and within a year for
 those with longer maximum sentences. The trial itself,
 sentencing, and appeals can delay the imposition of a criminal
 sentence for significant periods of time, sometimes adding a
 year or more to the entire process. Trial is by a judge, not a
 jury, in nearly all criminal cases. Defendants have a right to
 
 
 669
 MEXICO
 counsel, and public defenders are available. Other rights
 include protection against self-incriminaton, the right to
 confront one's accusers, the right to a translator if one's
 native language is not Spanish, and the right to a public
 trial. Protection of these rights is improving, but such
 protections are not always observed in practice. The problem
 of delayed sentencing is one of the major causes of
 over-crowding in the prison system. The CNDH has begun to
 address this problem by issuing several recommendations to
 judges to render timely sentences.
 The National Front Against Repression (FNCR) states that there
 are currently 5 political prisoners in the country who were
 imprisoned before President Salinas took office, down from the
 33 reported in 1989. Historically the FNCR has claimed that
 most political prisoners in Mexico were peasants and peasant
 activists arrested in land disputes. The Government disputes
 the appellation."political prisoner" altogether, charging that
 most of those listed over the years by the FNCR have been
 guilty of common crimes such as terrorism, criminal
 association, and damage to property.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Privacy and freedom from intrusion by the Government into
 homes, family, and correspondence are rights protected under
 aticle 16 of the Constitution. Although search-warrants are
 required by law, human rights activists charge that unlawful
 searches occur frequently in Mexico. Peasants and urban
 squatters involved in conflicts over land titles have charged
 that local landowners, accompanied by police, have entered
 their homes without appropriate judicial orders and sometimes
 resorted to violence, particularly in rural areas. Wiretaps
 placed in violation of the law were found in the office of PAN
 Governor Ernesto Ruffo Appel of Baja California and in the
 offices of the CNDH. By year's end, invpstigations into the
 perpetrators of both attempts had not been concluded.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and of the press are provided for by the
 Constitution. Opposition leaders freely voice their criticism
 of the Government and there are a large number of newspapers
 and magazines with a wide range of editorial views. The
 Government's control of a significant advertising budget and
 its former role as the sole newsprint supplier have long fueled
 charges that it used its leverage to pressure editors into
 quashing unfavorable reports. Also, a number of journalists
 depend upon receipt of "under-the-table" payments from the
 often public entities they cover to supplement low wages.
 Opposition political parties and independent observers charge
 that Mexico's two principal television networks, one government
 owned and the other privately owned, accord the PRI inordinate
 news coverage, particularly at election time. The Federal
 Electoral Code provides opposition parties during an electoral
 campaign with 15 minutes per month of television time and
 additional time in proportion to their electoral strength.
 Violence and threats against journalists continued in 1991.
 The death of physician and columnist Victor Manuel Oropeza
 Contreras in July was the most controversial individual human
 rights case during the year. Oropeza's murder sparked outrage
 
 
 670
 MEXICO
 among those believing he was killed because he had recently
 written articles critical of the MFJP. Then assistant to the
 Attorney General and human rights activist Teresa Jardi and
 others were critical of the subsequent police investigation
 conducted by a special prosecutor appointed by the Attorney
 General. A respected advocate for human rights whose presence
 lent credibility to reform efforts, Jardi left the Attorney
 General's office shortly thereafter. The alleged perpetrators
 of the Oropeza murder were arrested, but the victim's family
 and others expressed strong doubts that those arrested were
 guilty. At the request of the CNDH, Oropeza's body was exhumed
 for a second autopsy which confirmed the finding of the first
 autopsy that death was caused by knife wounds and that there
 was no evidence of torture. The case investigation was
 continuing at year's end.
 The Oropeza case was one of a series of attacks on journalists
 that are the subject of a special CNDH study. In response to a
 complaint by the Union of Denmocratic Journalists, the
 Commission began an inquiry in 1990 into 55 cases of alleged
 denial of the human rights of journalists. Of these, 17 were
 passed to the regular complaint program or were not pursued
 either because of a lack of information or because they did not
 involve journalists. In December the CNDH updated its report
 on the study. In 14 cases those responsible had already been
 convicted; in 3 other cases (Hector Felix, Manuel Burgueno, and
 Elvira Marcelo Esquivel) the killers had been convicted, but
 complainants were pressing for further investigation and
 prosecution of the intellectual authors; in 14 cases the CNDH
 issued recommendations calling for the investigation and
 punishment of officials involved in the attacks. One case was
 dismissed after a finding of no wrongdoing, while another, that
 of Manuel Buendia, remained pending because the alleged
 intellectual author of his murder is imprisoned on another
 charge. Of the remaining cases, three have been shelved
 because of a lack of evidence or jurisdiction, and two
 investigations remain pending.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution grants the right of peaceful assembly for any
 lawful purpose. A government permit is generally required for
 major demonstrations. The Government, with few exceptions,
 permits demonstrations by a broad range of political groups.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution permits persons to practice the religion of
 their choice. In December a constitutional amendment was
 approved by both houses of Congress and several state
 legislatures (with final ratification expected in January 1992)
 that would transform the legal relationship between Church and
 State in Mexico. Applicable to all faiths, it would grant
 religious bodies legal standing, authorize them to own
 property, run private schools, and permit clergy to vote and
 wear religious garb in public. These are all rights that have
 been denied de jure since the Mexican Revolution while
 tolerated de facto. The clergy remain barred under the pending
 change from holding public office and advocating partisan
 political positions.
 Mexico is predominantly Roman Catholic, though Protestant,
 Mormon, Jewish, and other religious communities also exist
 unfettered. Protestant evangelists and Mormons, principally
 foreign-supported groups, are active and especially successful
 
 
 671
 MEXICO
 in certain rural and largely indigenous communities. A
 significant rapprochement between the Catholic Church and the
 State, begun by President de la Madrid and carried forward by
 President Salinas, continued in 1991. Bishops even ventured
 into political commentary during the midterm elections,
 encouraging voting, criticizing fraud, and calling for honest
 elections.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement within and outside the country is unrestricted. The
 Government has customarily admitted persons recognized by the
 U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Approximately'42,000
 Guatemalan-refugees reside in camps and resettlement areas in
 three southern Mexican states. Since 1990 they have been
 permitted to accept work outside their camps and may travel
 freely in the five-state area of Chiapas, Campeche,,Quintana
 Roo, Tabasco, and Yucatan. The Government estimates that an
 additional 500,000 Central Americans, most of them Guatemalans
 and Salvadorans, are living illegally in Mexico, primarily in
 the southern border areas and the Federal District.
 Undocumented Central Americans lead a precarious existence
 because they are subject to deportation if caught, and they are
 often exploited by private Mexicans as a source of cheap
 labor. The CNDH has drafted a law, similar to a U.S. amnesty
 law, that would enable all-those Central Americans to apply for
 citizenship who could prove long-term residence in Mexico. It
 has been held up while voluntary organizations complete a study
 on the numbers of refugees to whom the law would apply. Once
 their status as undocumented aliens is recognized, some of
 these Central Americans will presumably be eligible for refugee
 status under a new population law that was passed in 1990. The
 Mexican Refugee Assistance Committee (COMAR) was processing the
 recognition of 5,000 Guatemalans under this law at year's end.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Since 1929, Mexico's government has been controlled by the PRI,
 which has won every presidential race and every gubernatorial
 race except the 1989 Baja California Norte election. To
 maintain power, the PRI has relied on extensive public
 patronage, the use of government and party organizational
 resources, and, according to respected independent observers,
 electoral irregularities.
 The midterm federal elections were the first conducted under
 the auspices of the new federal electoral law, COFIPE, approved
 by the Congress in 1990. COFIPE introduced several changes
 into the electoral process, including the complete renovation
 of the official list of voters and distribution of over 36
 million voting credentials to eligible voters. COFIPE also
 strengthened opposition political party representation at the
 Federal Electoral Institute, which supervises federal
 elections, and created a Federal Electoral Tribunal (TFE), an
 autonomous oversight commission that rules on electoral-related
 disputes.
 On August 18, the PRI tallied over 61 percent of the vote,
 winning 290 of 300 directly elected federal deputies, 31 of 32
 Senate races, and all 6 contests for Governor. In addition, it
 had won the governorship of Nuevo Leon contested in July.
 While hundreds of allegations of electoral wrongdoing were
 filed, the consensus of observers and analysts was that an
 
 
 MEXICO
 election devoid of fraud would not have significantly altered
 the PRI's strong showing.
 However, electoral fraud apparently did alter the results of
 some state and local elections, especially in the states of
 Guanajuato, San Luis Potosi, and Sonora. In San Luis Potosi,
 an election monitoring effort led by the respected Mexican
 Academy of Human Rights suggested that electoral fraud occurred
 in over half the voting booths, bolstering opposition claims
 that it was fraud that ensured victory by the PRI gubernatorial
 candidate. In Guanajuato, in some voting booths several
 hundred more people ckst ballots--almost all for the PRI--than
 the number of people registered in that precinct. Such fraud
 and the inability of electoral oversight organs to provide a
 satisfactory remedy resulted in widespread public protests and
 some election-related violence. After more than a week of
 controversy, the announced election results were set aside. In
 a compromise widely seen as having been imposed on the state
 party cadre by a Federal Government intent on defusing the
 opposition protests and removing the taint on the national
 elections of the egregious fraud in those states, the declared
 PRI winners resigned in both Guanajuato and San Luis Potosi and
 were replaced by interim governors pending new elections. The
 interim governor in San Luis Potosi was a PRI member but, in a
 surprise move, a PAN mayor was chosen as interim governor in
 Guanajuato. In December, municipal elections were held in both
 states with the PAN winning a significant share of the vote.
 New elections for governor are scheduled for April 1993 in San
 Luis Potosi, while the date in Guanajuato was still pending at
 year's end.
 Despite improvements provided for in COFIPE, the electoral
 process is still heavily weighted in favor of the PRI. While
 admitting that President Salinas' popularity and Mexico's
 economic resurgence contributed to the PRI's victory and that
 fraud was less prevalent than in past elections, opposition
 political parties claimed that sbphisticated manipulation and
 intimidation bolstered the PRI vote and denied opposition
 victories in some races-
 The opposition's strongest criticism concerned the official
 voter list, which it charged was manipulated by inflating the
 number of PRI voters, removing the names of opposition
 supporters, or not delivering voting credentials to them.
 Opposition allegations were bolstered by the Government's
 failures in reporting election results on time and its
 inability to deliver credentials to everyone who met the
 registration requirements. The opposition also complained
 about the use of government resources to support campaigns of
 PRI candidates. COFIPE outlaws such support, and opposition
 representatives filed criminal charges against some government
 and PRI officials for violating this law. Independent
 observers also critized the Government's frequent use of
 patronage, particularly in the form of the Government's social
 services and development program--the National Solidarity
 Program (Ponasol)--for partisan political advantage.
 Many in the opposition still do not have confidence that the
 electoral oversight and review organs will act impartially.
 Consequently, nongovernmental human rights organizations and
 civic and academic groups have taken it upon themselves to
 serve as independent electoral watchdogs. For example, during
 the 1991 elections, the Council for Democracy, a loosely
 aligned group of academics, journalists, and politicians,
 organized a "quick count" of the vote results from Mexico City;
 
 
 673
 MEXICO
 its results mirrored the official results.  The opposition is
 also increasingly bringing cases of election-related human
 rights violations before multilateral organizations. In 1990
 the Inter-American Human Rights Commission (IAHRC) issued its
 report to the Organization of American States (OAS) on a suit
 filed in 1987 by the PAN. The report ruled in favor of the PAN
 complaint, noting that "the Nuevo Leon electoral law does not
 fully and effectively protect the exercise of political rights
 and does not provide for simple, swift, and effective recourse
 to independent and impartial tribunals.. .the Government of
 Mexico must immediately adopt measures to see that the law is
 corrected." The Government has not acted on the OAS's
 recommendation, although the newly elected PRI governor in
 Nuevo Leon has promised to reform the state electoral code.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government permits both domestic and international human
 rights-groups to operate in Mexico without restrictions or
 harassment. Ranking Mexican officials routinely meet with
 domestic and international human rights activists to discuss
 human rights problems. In June 1990, President Salinas
 established the semiautonomous National Commission on Human
 Rights (CNDH) and appointed respected jurist Jorge Carpizo
 Macgregor as its president. In December 1991, both houses of
 Congress approved constitutional reforms that would make the
 CNDH legally independant. Final ratification is expected in
 January 1992. The Commission's advisory council is composed of
 respected human rights leaders, and Dr. Carpizo has received
 strong support from, President Salinas for CNDH efforts.
 During its first 18 months of operation, through December 1991,
 the CNDH received 5,741 complaints. It had concluded 3,325
 cases and the remainder were pending. Of those concluded,
 1,123 were settled during investigation by counseling or
 agreement. The Commission issued 158 recommendations in
 connection with the remaining cases that resulted in 138
 officials being punished for human rights violations--64 were
 awaiting trial for criminal offenses, 37 were dismissed from
 their jobs, and 36 had been suspended. Sixty-three cases were
 closed with a finding that no public official bore
 responsibility for the alleged wrongdoing. The remaining cases
 were either dismissed for lack of jurisdiction or were awaiting
 additional information from complainants. Until now, however,
 there have been few convictions of officials for extrajudicial
 - killings, torture, or similar serious offenses. The murder
 convictions of the police involved in the Angostura killings
 were the most noteworthy such-convictions in 1991.
 There are more than 75 nongovernmental human rights
 organizations active in Mexico. One leading organization, the
 Mexican Academy of Human Rights, is composed of respected
 political and academic figures and serves primarily as an
 information clearinghouse on human rights abuses. This year it
 organized observers and issued a study of the August 18
 election in San Luis Potosi that revealed a long list of
 actions by the state PRI and local government officials ranging
 from minor breaches of the electoral code to outright fraud
 (see Section 3). The National Commission-for the Promotion and
 Defense of Human Rights was created in 1990 by experts formerly
 associated with the Academy. This organization takes a direct
 role advocating individual cases. It criticized the Government
 for the impunity of officials who abuse human rights, arguing
 that, despite CNDH efforts, few officials had been convicted of

 torture or more serious offenses. Twelve state governments
 have created human rights commissions and, in Baja California,
 the first Office of Attorney General for Human Rights was
 created.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Mexico takes pride in its Spanish and indigenous origins and in
 the success the country has achieved in fostering a climate of
 racial harmony. Indigenous groups, many of which do not speak
 Spanish, are encouraged to participate in political life, and
 the Government is respectful of their desire to retain elements
 of their traditional lifestyle. However, these groups remain
 largely, outside the country's political and economic
 mainstream, a result not of overt governmental discrimination
 but rather of longstanding patterns of economic and social
 development. The Government's National Program for Development
 of Indigenous Peoples acknowledged in a report that "a set of
 relations of inequality for indigenous peoples .... still
 exists." These groups are severely disadvantaged in access to
 medical care and education. The continued existence of large-
 family estates results in a severe shortage of land for
 indigenous people to feed a rapidly growing population.
 Federal law was changed in 1991 to require that indigenous
 peoples not fluent in Spanish have an interpreter at every.
 stage of a criminal proceeding.
 Historically, women in Mexico have played a subordinate role,
 economically,-politically, and socially. However, women are
 becoming increasingly active economically and politically. One
 woman is a member of President Salinas' Cabinet, and others are
 key congressional and union leaders. Legally, women are equal
 to men. They have the right to file for separation and
 divorce, and to own property in their own name. The
 Constitution provides for equal pay for equal work and for
 maternity leave. Domestic assault is a crime, but in
 practice--largely due to social tradition--women are often
 reluctant to file reports of abuse or to press charges. Police
 are reluctant to intervene in what is often considered a
 domestic affair. After a successful effort to reform the law
 on sexual crimes in 1990, specialized medical and social
 assistance is now available for rape victims, at least in urban
 areas, and there are penalties for sexual harassment. Violence
 against women in prison continues to be reported, particularly
 in overcrowded facilities where, contrary to law, women are
 held in common areas with men. In rural areas there have been
 reports of harassment and mistreatment of indigenous women in
 the aftermath of land evictions. Four bodyguards of former
 Attorney General antinarcotics chief Javier Coello Trejo, who
 were originally charged with a series of rapes in Mexico City,
 remain in jail with additional charges pending against them.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution and specific provisions of the current Federal
 Labor Law (FLL) give workers the right'to form and join trade
 unions of their own choosing. 'Unions must register with the
 Labor Secretariat and, although registration requirements are
 not onerous, there have been charges that they have not been
 uniformly applied. About 30 to 35 percent of the total Mexican
 work force of 23 to 26 million (some 11 to 12 million in the
 formal sector and 12 to 14 million in the informal sector) is
 
 
 675
 MEXICO
 organized in trade unions, most of which are members of several
 large union confederations, also known as labor centrals.
 Mexican unions may join together freely in labor centrals
 without the Government's prior approval.
 The principal Mexican trade union organization is the
 Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), which is
 organizationally a major sector of the PRI. All PRI-affiliated
 federations and a number of the independents (a total of 36
 organizations) belong to the Congress of Labor (CT), a trade
 union coordinating body which represents approximately 85
 percent of Mexico's organized workers. The significant
 presence of union officers in the Government, especially in
 elected positions, and the continued heavy union influence in
 the nominating process for candidates at all levels of
 government, perpetuates a symbiotic relationship which limits
 the freedom of action of unions. For example, union officers
 support government economic policies and PRI political
 candidates in return for having a voice in policy formation.
 The next largest category of trade unions is that of strictly
 apolitical unions. Many, but not all, are company unions, with
 widely varying degrees of independence from management
 influence. The smallest category encompasses unions and labor
 centrals that oppose the PRI. Spokespersons for the largest
 unions in this category claimed in 1991 that in practice
 federal and state government registrars have improperly
 frustrated attempts to register new unions that oppose the PRI
 politically.
 Mexican law grants workers the right to strike. The FLL
 requires as a first step that a 6- to 10-day strike notice be
 filed, followed by a brief, government-sponsored mediation
 effort. If a strike is ruled illegal, employees must return to
 work within 24 hours or face dismissal for cause. On the other
 hand, once a legally recognized strike occurs, by law the
 company (or its subunit) that is the strike target must shut
 down totally. The FLL also permits strikes by public sector
 employees, although this rarely occurs. In the early months of
 1991 a dissident group within the National Teachers Union
 undertook wildcat work stoppages for better wages. The
 Government granted all teachers a 25-percent wage hike,
 recognizing that a real gap had developed between teachers' pay
 and that of comparable employees.
 There were no major, prolonged strikes in 1991. There was,
 however, a well-publicized effort by union dissidents and
 former workers of the Ford plant outside Mexico City to hold a
 new union recognition election. This grew out of a
 confrontation in 1990 between the incumbent CTM auto workers'
 union and dissident workers linked with a competing labor
 central. The dissidents eventually won their legal appeal, and
 a union representation election was held on June 3 which the
 CTM won by a close margin.
 Following the closing of a major oil refinery in Mexico City,
 there were a series of protests by workers who had been
 dismissed without benefits. Angered that their protests were
 not supported by their local of the Oil Workers Union, the
 protesters criticized the local. Shortly afterward, according
 to a credible report from a respected human rights advocate,
 Braulio Aguilar Reyes, the younger brother of one protester,
 was seized, beaten, and held incommunicadopart of the time in
 a police building by men whom he later identified as members of
 the Federal Judicial Police. He was not charged with any
 offense and was released after 36 hours, following pressure by
 
 
 676
 MEXICO
 the family and adfocacy groups. The assailants were arrested
 but, as of year's end, no proof of their alleged union link had
 been established.
 Mexico was again formally criticized by the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) in 1991 for its legal requirement that
 federal public sector employees can only belong to a single
 union in each category of public employment. Such federal
 employee unions, in turn, are grouped together in a single
 public sector labor central, the FSTSE.
 Unions and labor centrals"are free to join or affiliate with
 international labor organizations and do so actively.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The FLL strongly upholds the right to organize and to bargain
 collectively. On the-basis of only a small showing of interest
 by emplyee, an employer must recognize the union concerned
 and make arrangements either for a union recognition election
 or proceed immediately to negotiate a collective bargaining
 agreement, and such agreements are commonplace. FLL prounion
 bias is so pronounced that it has led many employers to
 encourage company unionism as an alternative to organization by
 national or local unions affiliated with the dominant labor
 centrals.
 The public sector is almost totally organized. The degree of
 private sector organization varies widely by states. While
 most traditional industrial areas are heavily organized,-states
 with a small industrial base usually have few unions. Workers
 are protected by law from antiunion discrimination, but this
 law is unevenly enforced, especially in states with a low
 degree of unionization.
 The rate of unionization of in-bond export, or "maquiladora,"
 industries varies, but the rate of unionization on average for
 in-bond export industries is comparatively low. A 1990 study
 by the U.S. Department of Labor suggested that antiunion bias
 by employers played a contributing role. The report also cited
 allegations, denied by the Mexican Government and labor
 centrals, of a tacit agreement to refrain from organizing the
 in-bond export plants. The Attorney General for Human Rights
 of Baja California attributes the low rate of unionization of
 "maquiladoras" in his state to the fact that the relatively
 good wage and benefit packages of the large "maquiladoras" have
 reduced the incentives to unionize.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution prohibits forced labor. There have been no
 credible reports for many years of forced labor in Mexico.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The FLL sets 14 as the minimum age for employment by children.
 Children from 14 to 15 may work a maximum of 6 hours, may not
 work overtime or at night, and may not be employed in jobs
 deemed hazardous. This means there is little incentive for a
 responsible employer to hire children under the age of 16,
 especially since in most instances more mature adults are
 available at the same wage scale. In the formal sector,
 enforcement is reasonably adequate for large- and medium-size
 companies;- it is less certain for small companies. As with
 employee safety and health, the worst enforcement problem is
 
 
 677
 MEXICO
 with the many very small companies, especially those with five
 or fewer employees. Child labor is largely found in the
 informal economy. It is widely believed that the informal
 economy includes significant numbers of underage street
 vendors, employees in very small business, and workers in rural
 areas.
 In 1991 the Secretariat of Labor and Social Welfare (STPS) and
 the U.S. Department of Labor undertook joint studies of both
 the child labor problems and the nature of the informal
 economies in Mexico and the United States as part of an effort
 to consider better ways for both countries to prevent illegal
 child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Constitution and the FLL provide for a minimum wage for
 workers, which is set by the tripartite National Minimum Wage
 Commission (government/labor/employers). In December 1987, the
 major labor centrals and unions, along with employers, agreed
 to a temporary tripartite accord to limit price and wage
 increases. It has been renewed annually since then. Since
 1987, annual minimum wage adjustments have been made to
 compensate for inflation only. Generally, in the private
 sector in the past few years, wages set by collective
 bargaining agreements have kept pace with inflation even though
 the minimum wage did not.
 The FLL sets 48 hours as the legal workweek. The FLL provides
 that workers who are asked to exceed 3 hours of overtime per
 day or work any overtime in 3 consecutive days must be paid
 triple the normal wage. For most industrial workers,
 especially unionized ones, the real workweek has declined to
 about 42 hours.   Mexico's legislation and rules regarding
 employee health and safety are relatively advanced. All
 employers are bound by law to observe the "general regulations
 on safety and health in the workplace" issued jointly by STPS
 and Mexican Institute of Social Security. The focal point of
 standard setting and enforcement in the workplace is in
 FLL-mandated bipartite (management and labor) safety and health
 committees in the plants and offices of every company. These
 meet at least monthly to consider workplace safety and health
 needs and file copies of their minutes with federal or state
 labor inspectors.
 Government labor inspectors schedule their own activities
 largely in response to the findings of these workplace
 committees.
