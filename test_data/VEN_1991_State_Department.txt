 VENEZUELA
 Venezuela is a republic with an active multiparty democratic
 system, a free press, strong labor unions, and a longstanding
 commitment to democracy. For more than 30 years, power has
 passed peacefully between the two major political parties
 through open elections. In 1988 a third party emerged as a
 significant political factor.
 The security apparatus has civilian and military elements, both
 of which are held accountable to popularly elected
 authorities. Although the military services focus on
 conventional war, one of its branches, the National Guard, has
 arrest authority and supplies the top leadership for one of the
 country's police forces. There were a few instances in 1991
 when 'the National Guard was called upon to restore public order
 following rioting. Both police and National Guard personnel
 were responsible for human rights abuses during the year.
 Venezuela's economy is dominated by the public sector. The
 state-owned petroleum industry currently accounts for some 23
 percent of the gross domestic product, more than any other
 industry. The Government is in the process of a major economic
 restructuring to reduce its dependence on oil exports, to
 privatize many public sector firms, and to enable domestic
 business to compete more effectively in the international
 market. Human rights groups are concerned that the removal, in
 the context of a wide-ranging government austerity program, of
 most subsidies for basic foods, medicine, and transportation,
 has aggravated poverty. The Government has attempted to
 redirect its welfare programs toward the neediest segments of
 the population.
 Venezuelans have generally enjoyed a wide range of freedoms and
 individual rights, including a free press, active unions, and
 free elections. There are, however, serious human rights
 abuses. In 1991 they included: arbitrary and excessively
 lengthy detentions; frequent abuse of detainees; extrajudicial
 killings by the police and military; the failure to punish
 police and security officers accused of abuses; corruption and
 gross inefficiency in the judicial and law enforcement systems;
 deplorable prison conditions; and violence and discrimination
 against women. Increased crime rates have led to demands for
 greater police protection, and police have responded with the
 tactic of periodic "sweeps" through poor, crime-ridden
 neighborhoods. Incidents of extrajudicial killings and
 arbitrary arrests appear to increase during these "sweeps."
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political killings in 1991. Instances
 of extrajudicial killings, however, continue. The press
 routinely reported cases of the police shooting and killing
 criminal suspects apparently without appropriate justification,
 of security forces killing civilians, and of arrested persons
 dying while in police custody. Charges are rarely brought
 against the perpetrators of such killings. If perpetrators are
 prosecuted, the sentences issued are usually light, or, more
 commonly, overturned in the appeals process.

 VENEZUELA
 A case in point was the "suicide" in 1990 of a young man in a
 police station. An autopsy performed in 1991 indicated that
 the young man died from severe beatings to the chest, head, and
 neck. Several similar cases were reported in the press during
 1991. Some of those killed had been picked up during police
 sweeps of high-crime neighborhoods; others were known
 criminals. One murderer, reported by the police to have died
 during a shoot-out, was found to have broken bones and a broken
 back. His funeral attracted 4,000 people, most of whom
 attended to protest police violence and abuse of human rights.
 There have been credible reports of women who were picked up as
 illegal aliens and who were then abused or even killed by
 policemen. An example is the murder of Eldrys Josefina Brito,
 a 22-year-old woman operating a small business in downtown
 Caracas. According to witnesses who saw her last, she was
 arrested by policemen. Her body was found burned beyond
 recognition, and an autopsy revealed she had been raped and
 repeatedly beaten. Preliminary police investigations indicated
 that members of an urban security unit of the National Cuard
 arrested her. Further investigations showed that the young
 woman was turned over to the Caracas Metropolitan Police, who
 are alleged to have committed the murder. The case was still
 being investigated at year's end.
 In early 1991 a military court dismissed all charges against 19
 security force members accused in the 1988 shooting deaths of
 14 persons by Venezuelan security forces in the town of El
 Amparo, near the Colombian border. Several of the victims and
 their families are not Venezuelan citizens, and the military
 court interpreted Article 177 of the Military Justice Code as
 clearly stating that only Venezuelans could accuse military
 personnel. The lawyers of the victims argued unsuccessfully
 that international conventions signed by Venezuela prohibit
 judicial discrimination based on national origin.
 Nevertheless, 14 of the accused remain under detention while a
 military procurator investigates the case.
 Numerous cases of extrajudicial killings and other abuses by
 security forces and the police during the riots of February-
 March 1989 remained stalled during 1991 in both military and
 civilian courts. Of approximately 300 cases involving charges
 of extrajudicial killings, abuse of authority, indiscriminate
 shooting, and similar violations, only 1 case'has been
 adjudicated: a police officer was found guilty of homicide and
 sentenced to 1 year's imprisonment. The Committee of Family
 Members of Victims of the riots (COFAVIC), formed in 1989 to
 support riot victims' family members, continues to call for a
 thorough investigation and prosecution of the cases.
 b. Disappearance
 There continue to be reports of persons disappearing without
 explanation. Some persons reportedly have disappeared while in
 police custody. Human rights groups cite, as an example, the
 case of Fidel Jimenez, who disappeared in March 1990 and whose
 remains were found in a lake in early October 1991. Jimenez
 was detained by the police for possessing goods for which he
 did not have sales slips. According to witnesses, he was
 beaten and freed. Human rights groups charge that Jimenez was
 rearrested and that the authorities are responsible for his
 disappearance, The case remained unresolved at year's end. At
 least 16 persons disappeared during the 1989 riots;
 investigations of these cases have so far not resulted in any
 clarifications. Witnesses, however, claimed that law
 
 
 764
 VENEZUELA
 enforcement authorities were involved.
 Progress in exhuming the bodies of 1989 riot victims buried in
 a mass grave in Caracas was stopped officially by a judicial
 order in November 1991. However, no examinations had taken
 place since November 1990. Local human rights organizations
 have initiated legal action to overturn the judge's negative
 ruling. Before the judge's unexpected action, human rights
 organizations attributed the delay to a lack of political will
 and public interest in resolving the killings, poor
 coordination between judges and experts overseeing the
 exhumations, and the failure of forensic officials to expedite
 the identification process. During an earlier judicial review
 of the Caracas burial site, other cadavers were found buried on
 top of those of the riot victims. Human rights groups charge
 that these were also victims of disappearance and killing by
 police forces.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by law,.but physical abuse of detainees
 and prisoners is prevalent and includes cases of electric
 shock, beatings, and rape. The Venezuelan Program for
 Education and Action in Human Rights (PROVEA), a local human
 rights group, reported 25 cases of torture in the first 7
 months of 1991. The Government routinely fails to investigate
 and prosecute the police officials responsible for these
 abuses. Of 16 Judicial Technical Police (PTJ) officers
 detained in late 1990 and accused of torture, 10 were released
 in early 1991, and no trial had taken place as of year's end.
 A young man accused members of DISIP (the Investigation and
 -Intelligence police) of torturing him to force him to confess
 to the murder of a wealthy businessman. In reports to the
 press following his release, the young man claimed he was
 subjected to electrical shocks to the testicles, suffocation
 with a plastic bag over his head filled with an unidentified
 chemical substance that inhibited breathing, and beatings. He
 was subsequently released when PTJ officers proved his
 innocence. Two teachers accused members of the PTJ of
 torturing them in prison, where they had been taken after being
 stopped in a routine traffic check. One of the two teachers
 was confined to a -wheelchair for 4 months following the
 beatings.
 Prison conditions are appalling and are strongly condemned by
 human rights groups and government officials. The Public
 Prosecutor (Fiscal General), in his latest report to the
 Congress, said that "the situation of prisons in Venezuela is
 pathetic, and in fact became worse during 1990. There are two
 vital problems for prisoners: their physical mistreatment and
 the abominable mismanagement of funds for these centers."
 Sporadic prison riots occurred during 1991, sparked by
 persistent complaints of poor prison conditions--notably,
 overcrowding, contaminated food, and physical abuse both by the
 guards and among prisoners.
 During the course of the year, the Ministry of Justice's office
 of prisons submitted a report to Congress suggesting ways and
 means to improve prison services. The report was reportedly
 rejected by a congressional subcommittee for a number of
 reasons, including lack of detail and a supposed failure to
 deal adequately with the overall problems faced by prisoners.
 Prison conditions remains the subject of active public debate,
 
 
 765
 VENEZUELA
 but concrete actions to improve conditions do not appear
 imminent.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 While the right to judicial determination of the legality of
 detention is provided by law, arrested'persons or persons under
 investigative detention legally can be held up to 8 days
 without a formal detention order, during which time they may be
 held incommunicado. Arbitrary arrests and arrests with
 improper warrants are common, and the time limits for holding
 persons are frequently exceeded. Even if a person is detained
 under a proper-order, the time of detention pending trial often
 exceeds the amount of time the person would have been required
 to serve had he or she been found guilty.
 Durinq prison riots in mid-1991, prisoners vociferously
 complained about being charged'by prison officials for
 transportation to judicial proceedings; detainees who lacked
 the money to pay were unable to get to their judicial
 hearings. Bail is permitted only for relatively minor crimes.
 Venezuela's bail laws continued under review by the Congress;
 the Government hopes that an increase in the applicability of
 bail provisions will contribute to relieving overcrowded
 prisons.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although the right to a fair trial is provided by law and some
 procedural safeguards exist, the burden of proof is on the
 accused to prove his or her innocence. Because of corruption
 and inefficiency, lengthy pretrial detention and case backlogs
 are the norm.
 The justice system is overburdened. The law provides public
 defenders for those unable to afford competent defense;
 however, the number of public defenders in the country is
 insufficient to meet this obligation. The Judicial Council,.
 the governing body of the judicial branch, indicated during
 1991 that there are some 150 public defense attorneys with an
 average of 170 active cases each. Because of the unequal
 distribution of cases, however, some defenders handle as many
 as 250 cases.
 Delays of 2 or 3 years in normal cases are not infrequent. The
 judicial process is almost exclusively a written one, requiring
 costly and time-consuming production of voluminous reports by
 judges, attorneys, and witnesses at every stage. Some
 Venezuelan leaders and legal experts also blame delays and
 other irregularities on corruption and the use of personal
 influence. The civilian judiciary is legally independent, but
 connections to the two major political parties are important in
 the judicial selection process.
 Civilians charged with armed subversion are tried by military
 courts as insurgents. There is neither a statute of
 limitations nor a requirement of speedy trial for cases in
 military courts, although persons convicted under the military
 justice system have the same right to appeal to the Supreme
 Court as those prosecuted under the civilian system. Military
 judges are appointed by the Supreme Court. Besides the lack of
 deadlines in the military system, the system's secrecy and
 tendency to close ranks make it unlikely that defendants
 undergo an impartial or timely prosecution and can result in
 offenders being shielded from responsibility for human rights
 
 
 766
 VENEZUELA
 abuses. For example, although the case of 19 security agents
 implicated in the October 1988 El Amparo incident has been sent
 back and forth between the military court system and the
 Supreme Court for more than 2 years and by the end of the year
 no verdict had been issued. Attempts by human rights groups
 and attorneys for the two survivors of the incident to shift
 the proceedings to the civilian courts were unsuccessful.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Venezuela has constitutional safeguards protecting citizens
 against arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, and
 correspondence. In general, these safeguards are effective,
 but there were several charges of wiretapping during 1991. A
 former chief of DISIP stated publicly that wiretapping is only
 possible through the collaboration of government security
 agencies. A bill to further protect the right to private
 communication has been under consideration by the Congress
 since 1990.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of the press and free
 speech. These liberties, along with academic freedom, are
 almost universally honored. Venezuela has a free and lively
 press, which frequently criticizes the Government and denounces
 instances of government interference in the media. However,
 serious questions about attitudes toward freedom of the press
 were raised by a break-in apparently perpetrated by military
 intelligence agents. In June the home of well-known journalist
 Rafael Poleo was burglarized, and documents said to link
 prominent political and military figures with current scandals
 were stolen. The outspoken editor accused the former'director
 of Military Intelligence (DIM) as the instigator of the
 break-in. Three DIM agents were subsequently arrested,
 although one of the three died in detention. His death is
 officially registered as a suicide, but it is widely believed
 that he was murdered in order to silence him. The press
 reported the Poleo case extensively; no intimidation or
 self-censorship was evident. In November, however, a judge
 issued a warrant for Poleo's arrest to face charges of illegal
 possession of a submachinegun. Some politicians and
 journalists criticized the action as politically motivated.
 Venezuela has 4 nationwide television networks, 2 of which are
 government-owned; 3 regional television stations; 168 radio
 stations; and numerous newspapers and magazines, with 9 dailies
 in Caracas alone. The Government is a significant source of
 advertising revenue for the media, but there appear to be no
 recent instances in which government advertising was channeled
 for political ends.
 b." Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is normally
 respected in Venezuela. Public meetings, including those of
 all political parties, are held without interference. Permits
 are required for public marches but are not denied for
 political reasons. Professional and academic associations
 operate without interference. Public protests that turn
 violent have sometimes been met with police force. In October
 and November, during protests against increased bus fares and
 
 
 767
 VENEZUELA
 the Government's economic reform package, at least six students
 were killed by the military and the police. For example, on
 November 20 two students and an off-duty soldier were killed by
 police officers, despite a government order banning security
 forces from using live ammunition. Due to a prompt
 investigation by the Attorney General, police authorities
 within 24 hours identified five officers who apparently removed
 the plastic antiriot bullets from their ammunition cartridges,
 replaced them with marbles, and allegedly fired them at the
 students and the off-duty soldier, causing their death. The
 policemen were under arrest and the investigations were
 proceeding at year's end.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The population is predominantly Roman Catholic, although other
 religious groups enjoy freedom of worship and proselytize
 actively. Foreign missionaries, both Catholic and Protestant,
 are active throughout the country.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens and legal residents generally have freedom to travel
 within the country and to go abroad and return. Venezuela
 traditionally has been a haven for refugees, exiles, and
 displaced persons from many European, Caribbean, and Latin
 American countries. Refugees are given-normal residence status
 and may be expelled only because of criminal activities.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Venezuela is a multiparty democracy, with a government freely
 elected by secret ballot. Suffrage is mandatory for all those
 18 years of age or older, and the political process is open to
 all. Elections for the President, Congress, and state
 legislative assemblies are held every 5 years. Governors and
 mayors were elected for the first time in Venezuelan history in
 1989, and voters also were able to choose individual candidates
 by name, rather than selecting only from among party slates.
 Political views are freely expressed, and persons from the
 entire political spectrum contend for positions ranging from
 municipal council seats to the presidency. The two largest
 parties are centrist: the Social Democratic (Democratic
 Action, AD) and the Social Christian (COPEI) parties. The
 Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party, founded by disenchanted
 members of the Venezuelan Communist party, has increased its
 share of the total vote in recent elections.
 Women and minorities participate fully in government and
 politics, if in smaller percentages than their proportionate
 representation in society. There are no de jure impediments to
 their free participation, but traditional attitudes produce
 some de facto impediments; women and minorities are promoted
 into high-level positions at a slower rate than men.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 A considerable number of local human rights groups are active
 and vigorously criticize perceived government inadequacies in
 redressing grievances. Some of the groups complain of police
 
 
 VENEZUELA
 harassment, including the disruption of legitimate protests,
 unlawful entry into the homes of activists, and surveillance.
 Two regional groups--the Latin American Foundation for Human
 Rights and Social Development, aid the Federation of Families
 of Disappeared Persons-have offices in Caracas. These human
 rights organizations are able to operate free of government
 restriction.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Venezuelan law prohibits discrimination based on ethnic
 origin. However, the country's indigenous population,
 comprised of an estimated 140,500 persons, frequently suffers
 from inattention to, and violation of, its human rights.
 Venezuela is home to seven major indigenous ethnic groups,
 including the Yanomami, who live mainly in the state of
 Amazonas bordering Brazil, end the Goajiros, settled in the
 western state of Zulia along Venezuela's border with Colombia.
 Many of the country's indigenous people live entirely isolated
 from modern civilization and thus lack, for example, access to
 health and educational facilities theoretically available to
 all Venezuelans. However, even groups that are more integrated
 into the social fabric complain of lack of access to medical
 facilities and care. In May representatives of the Warao
 comunities stated that only 1 doctor was available for 30
 indigenous communities and, as a result, 105 people had died in
 the preceding 2 weeks from an outbreak of diarrhea and
 vomiting. The Warao representatives also denounced actions by
 a government development organization that had resulted in a
 diversion of water from their area with a resultant destruction
 of crops. The same group complained of frequent beatings by
 personnel of the National Guard. The Attorney General's office
 is conducting an investigation.
 In response to frequent allegations from local and foreign
 anthropologists and environmental groups alleging mistreatment
 of Venezuela's approximately 14,000 Yanomami Indians, the
 Government during the year inaugurated the upper Orinoco-
 Casiquiane biospheric reserve. The 32,038-square mile reserve
 is designed to prevent development of and incursions into
 Yanomani territory. No mining, farming, colonization, or
 proselytizing will be permitted. The creation of this reserve
 is widely seen as an important step toward preserving
 indigenous culture and rights, affecting about one-tenth of
 Venezuela's Indian peoples. Yet the Government must still
 confront problems facing Venezuela's other indigenous groups,
 which often suffer human rights abuses and de facto exclusion
 from the social and economic benefits of citizenship.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex.
 According to women's groups, among the most serious problems
 facing Venezuelan women are: rape and assault (including by
 police officers--see Section l.a.); lack of access to education
 and medical care; and culturally ingrained discrimination that
 results in women's comparative exclusion from leadership
 positions in the political structure, trade unions, and the
 private sector. The first two problems especially, but not
 exclusively, impinge on women from the lower economic strata.
 The perpetrators of acts of aggression against women are rarely
 punished.
 During the Second Venezuelan Women's Conference, held in 1991
 and attended by women from all major political parties,
 
 
 769
 VENEZUELA
 suggestions were made to revise sections of the Penal Code that
 discriminate against women, as well as to provide greater
 protection for women under the Labor Code. Although no changes
 have been made in the Penal Code, labor laws were revised in
 1990, and the changes became effective in 1991. The new Labor
 Code specifies that women may not be discriminated against with
 regard to remuneration or working condftions, may not be fired
 during pregnancy and for a year after giving birth, are
 entitled to unpaid leave (and compensation from the social
 security agency) for 6 weeks before the birth of a child and 12
 weeks after, and are due 10 weeks of unpaid leave if they
 legally adopt children under 3 years of age.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Both constitutional and labor law recognize and encourage the
 right of unions to exist. The comprehensive Labor Code enacted
 in 1990 extends to all public sector and private sector
 employees (except members of the armed forces) the right to
 form and join unions of their choosing. There ire no
 restrictions on this right in practice and no special rules or
 laws governing.labor relations in export processing zones. The
 1990 Code mandates registration of unions with the Ministry of
 Labor but reduced the Ministry's discretion by specifying that
 registration may not be denied if the proper documents (a
 record of the founding meeting, the statutes, and the
 membership list) are submitted. Only a judge may dissolve a
 union, and then only for reasons listed in the law, such as the
 dissolution of a firm or by agreement of two-thirds of the'
 membership., One major union confederation, the Venezuelan
 Confederation of Workers (CTV), and three small ones, as well
 as a number of independent unions, operate freely in
 Venezuela. About 25 percent of the national labor force is
 organized.
 There are no restrictions on affiliation with international
 labor organizations, and many union organizations play active
 international roles. The CTV's top leadership includes members
 of several political parties. The majority are affiliated with
 the country's largest party, AD, and both reciprocally
 influence each other. The CTV, however, has repeatedly
 demonstrated its independence from both the Government, in
 which AD holds the presidency and a plurality of the seats in
 the Congress, and the parties, as evidenced by its frequent
 criticism of the Government's economic policies.
 The right of private sector and public sector employees to
 strike is recognized legally and upheld in practice. The Labor
 Code extended the right to strike to all government employees
 (except members of the armed services), but stated that it may
 only be exercised by public servants if it does not cause
 "irremediable damage to the population or to institutions." It
 also allowed the President to order public or private sector
 strikers back to work and to submit their dispute to
 arbitration if the strike "puts in immediate danger the lives
 or security of all or part of the population.". In recent
 years, Venezuelan workers seldom have resorted to strikes, but
 a decline in living standards has increased the willingness of
 workers to use them. During 1991 most strikes occurred among
 government employees.
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee on Freedom
 of Association in March asked the Government to assure that
 
 
 770
 VENEZUELA
 internal union disputes are settled by a vote of the members,
 and that settlement of strikes by compulsory arbitration only
 occur when essential services are involved.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Collective bargaining is protected and encouraged by the Labor
 Code and is freely practiced throughout Venezuela. According
 to the Code, employers "must negotiate" a collective contract
 with the union that represents the majority of their workers.
 It contains a provision stating that wages may be raised by
 administrative decree provided that the Congress approves the
 decree, and this procedure was followed in June to grant
 increases of 17-21 percent to persons not covered by collective
 contracts. (Employees with collective contracts did not receive
 the increase but were authorized to reopen contracts to
 negotiate similar pay levels.) In April the Vice Minister of
 Labor stated that "only 25 or 26 percent" of all employed
 workers are covered by collective contracts.
 The law prohibits employers from interfering with the formation
 of unions or with their activities and from stipulating as a
 condition of employment that new workers must abstain from
 union activity or must join a specified union. Complaints
 regarding violations of these articles of the law are heard by
 Ministry of Labor inspectors, who may impose a maximum fine of
 twice the monthly minimum wage, or about $200, for a first
 infraction. -
 Union officials have special protection against dismissal under
 the Code. If a judge determines that any worker was fired for
 union activity, the worker is entitled to back pay plus either
 reinstatement or payment of a substantial sum of money, which
 varies according to years of seniority. The ILO's Committee of
 Experts in 1991 questioned the adequacy of the sanctions
 provided for violations of the antiunion discrimination
 provisions.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in Venezuela. The Labor
 Code states that no one may "obligate others to work against
 their will."
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Labor Code allows children between the ages of 12 and 14 to
 work if given special permission by the National Institute for
 Minors or the Labor Ministry. Children between the ages of 14
 and 16 may work if given permission by their legal guardians.
 Minors may not work in mines, smelters, or in occupations "that
 risk life or health", in occupations that could damage
 intellectual or moral development, or in "public spectacles."
 For those under age 16 the workday may not exceed 6 hours or
 the workweek 30 hours. Minors under 18 may work only during
 the hours between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. The law is enforced
 effectively by the Ministry of Labor and the National Institute
 for Minors in the formal sector of the economy, but much less
 so in the informal sector, which by the end of 1990 accounted
 for an estimated 41 percent of total employment.
 Although education is technically compulsory until age 15, many
 students drop out of school before they reach that age. Some
 children work as street vendors; there is no other occupation
 
 
 771
 VENEZUELA
 in which employment of children is believed to be substantial.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Venezuela has a national urban minimum wage rate and a national
 rural minimum wage rate. To this minimum wage provision should
 be added mandatory fringe benefits thai vary with the workers'
 individual circumstances but in general would increase wages by
 about one-third. Only domestic workers and concierges are
 legally excluded from coverage under the minimum wage decrees.
 Under the Labor Code, the rates are set by administrative
 decree, but the decree is then sent to Congress, which may
 suspend or ratify it but may not modify the decree. Minimum
 wages are enforced effectively in the formal sector of the
 economy by the Ministry of Labor. There is no reliable
 information regarding compliance in the informal sector. No
 current, widely accepted statistics on poverty are available,
 but the World Bank, using 1989 data provided by the Government,
 calculated that 54 percent of households lived in poverty at
 that time. The percentage is generally believed to have
 increased since then. Concern about rising poverty prompted
 the Government in May to increase the urban minimum wage rate
 by 50 percent and the rural minimum wage rate by 80,percent.
 The 1990 Labor Code reduced the standard workweek to a maximum
 of 44 hours. Some unions, such as the petroleum workers, have
 negotiated a 40-hour week. Overtime may not exceed 2 hours
 daily, 10 hours weekly, or 100 hours annually, and may not be
 paid at a rate less than time and a half. These standards are,
 effectively enforced by the Ministry of Labor in the formal
 sector.
 A health and safety law was passed in 1986, but its enforcement
 awaits implementing regulations. The delays are largely due to
 concern over the fact that the law provides penal sanctions
 against management when violations of health and safety occur
 and ambiguity in the law over what constitutes a violation.
 The 1990 Labor Code states that employers are obligated to pay
 specified amournts (up to a maximum of 25 times the minimum
 salary) to workers for accidents or occupational sicknesses
 regardless of who is responsible for negligence. It also
 requires that workplaces must maintain "sufficient protection
 for health and life against sicknesses and accidents," and it
 imposes fines of from one-quarter to two times the minimum
 salary for first infractions. Labor Ministry inspectors
 enforce the law and appear to be generally effective.
