 ARGENTINA
 For the past 25 years Argentina has experienced cyclical
 changes between civilian-and military governments. Since
 1955 there have been six civilian and six military presi-
 dents. Beginning in 1969, violence mounted steadily
 from the left and then from the right as groups with
 widely different political objectives and conceptions
 struggled for power. As a result of this violence and
 instability, both civilian and military governments have
 maintained a state of siege for some ten of the past
 eleven years.
 At the time the military took control of the state in
 1976, the situation in Argentina had deteriorated sharply.
 Courts and political leaders were intimidated, inflation
 approached 800 percent, and many essential public services
 were disrupted. Terrorism had taken on broad dimensions:
 bombings, robberies, kidnappings and assassinations for
 political reasons were common occurrences. Organized
 terrorist groups on both sides of the political spectrum
 numbered some 5,000-6,000 persons, with sympathizers
 estimated at an additional 15,000. The new government
 promised to restore stability, promote economic recovery,
 end terrorism and corruption, and ultimately to restore
 democracy. Maintaining the state of siege imposed in
 1974 by President Maria Estela Peron, the armed forces
 closed congress, deposed.the president, and replaced
 all members of the supreme court. Elected state and
 local government officials were replaced by military
 officers, and political party activities, including the
 right of assembly, were prohibited. Most trade unions
 were subjected to government intervention, and all strikes
 were banned. The security forces embarked on a widespread
 campaign of violence aimed at terrorists as well as those
 elements of society they considered subversive. Many
 known or suspected terrorists, as well as many persons
 with no subversive record, disappeared. Many others
 were detained by the executive without any specific charge
 under the state of siege powers of the constitution.
 In 1978 spokesmen for the government announced that the
 war on terrorism had been won. The diminished threat
 from violence of the left and right, the government's
 own initiatives toward bettering the human rights situation,
 and its increasing awareness of international concern
 over Argentina's human rights image have contributed
 to a reduction in the number of violations.
 The human rights situation in Argentina improved in 1980,
 although serious problems remained. Most seriously,
 fundamental, internationally-recognized rights of the
 integrity of the person have been violated through the
 continued application by the security forces of the practice
 of disappearances, although at a level much lower than
 occurred in the first two years of the present military
 regime. In 1980, there were 28 or more reported disap-
 pearances; at least 12 have been credibly documented.
 Most observers believe torture and summary execution
 continue to be practiced in these cases.
 The most carefully recorded and documented list of unex-
 plained disappearances, compiled by the Permanent Assembly
 for Human Rights in Buenos Aires, contains about 5,600
 cases for the period 1976 to 1979. Some estimates, however,
 run considerably higher. There is substantial evidence
 that most of those persons were abducted by the security
 forces and interrogated under torture. Many observers
 
 
 330
 believe these persons have been summarily executed.
 There has been no accounting for past disappearances.
 About 8,200 persons have been detained since 1974 under
 the special executive powers of the president (PEN).
 This number has been reduced. In December 1980 the govern-
 ment acknowledged that approximately 900 persons remain
 under PEN detention. Including these prisoners, the
 total number of persons being held on other than criminal
 charges totaled about 1,550. Of these, about 600 had
 been tried and convicted, another 400 were in trial status,
 and about 550 were being held without trial and/or charges,
 some for many years or even after having-served their
 sentences. Government figures indicate that this year
 eight new arrests were made under the executive's special
 powers and 888 persons were removed from PEN detention.
 There continue to be reliable reports that individuals
 detained as suspected terrorists or subversives are subject
 to physical mistreatment during interrogation.
 The constitutional right of certain kinds of detainees
 to choose self-exile in lieu of imprisonment has been
 circumscribed through the imposition of a lengthy applica-
 tion and screening process. Prison conditions have improved.
 Earlier problems of serious mistreatment, overcrowding,
 lack of medical treatment, improper food, and restrictions
 on visits have diminished. However, there is still concern
 over psychological pressures in the prisons which may
 have contributed to some five suicides this year.
 In September 1979, the Inter-American Human Rights Commission
 (IAHRC). visited Argentina to investigate human rights
 abuses. Its 266 page report, published in April 1980,
 documented serious violations of human rights during
 the period covered by the report (1975-1979), and recommend-
 ed that specific actions be taken by the Argentine govern-
 ment to promote the observance of human rights. The
 Argentine government took exception to aspects of the
 report; at the same time it reported to the Organization
 of American States (OAS) the actions it has taken or
 intends to take to carry out many of the report's recommenda-
 tions. A resolution referring to this report as well
 as to other IAHRC reports was adopted by consensus after
 a prolonged debate at the November OAS General Assembly.
 Opportunities for the exercise of political freedoms
 remain circumscribed by the prohibition on political
 party activities, as such, and by limitations on freedom
 of expression. However, a dialogue with many of the
 nation's political leaders aimed ultimately at removing
 these restrictions was begun by the government. Politicians
 and the press spoke out increasingly on the government's
 actions and plans, and public dissent from the government's
 decisions and open criticism of its policies and programs,
 including the statements and activities of opposition
 leaders, were reported regularly in the press. - Increasingly,
 civilian leaders organized meetings and conferences to
 consider national issues. At the same time, politicians
 were occasionally detained on the grounds that they had
 overstepped the limits of the law. The new political
 parties law, which the gove iment had promised to issue
 this year, is now expected in 1981. The military designated
 a new military president for the period 1981-1984, while
 reiterating its commitment to return the country to civilian,
 democratic rule. However, as of the end of 1980, no
 date has been fixed for that devolution.
 
 
 331
 The 1980 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Adolfo Perez
 Esquivel, Secretary of the Peace and Justice Movement,
 for his non-violent advocacy of human rights in Argentina
 and elsewhere in Latin America. He was imprisoned in
 1977-1978 for his activities.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Article 20 of the Argentine constitution prohibits torture.
 Most observers have concluded that torture continues
 to be practiced in the cases of individuals who disappear
 at the hands of security officials, and are presumed
 dead. Former detainees have reported that torture, practiced
 during the first days of the interrogation, took the
 form of electric shock, immersion of the head in water,
 mock executions, severe beatings, and psychological abuse.
 Reports from some people detained for national security
 reasons during 1980 indicated that physical mistreatment
 continues to be used during the interrogation phase.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Before early 1979, conditions of imprisonment for those
 detained for security reasons were poor and medical services
 were rudimentary. In April 1979, the government decreed
 uniform prison-regulations which have led to a general
 improvement in prison conditions for most categories
 of prisoners. Many of the reforms were not applied to
 all prisoners, in particular those detained for political
 reasons and considered by the authorities to be subversive
 or dangerous. While conditions reportedly improved for
 this category for & time after the issuance of the decree,
 they again deteriorated thereafter. Many of these prisoners
 were denied visitation, communication, exercise, and
 work. In May 1980, a new decree was issued which was
 designed to reduce abuses and disciplinary measures by
 prison guards, improve medical care and provide increased
 family visits, visits by counsel, and access to reading
 material, work and exercise. Initial reports suggest
 there has been improvement in these areas. However,
 concern remains about psychological pressures affecting
 prisoners, in view of the approximately five suicides
 this year.
 c. Disappearances
 The Argentine Permanent Assembly on Human Rights has
 recorded twelve reports of disappearances in circumstances
 which indicate the victim was abducted by the security
 forces. Human rights organizations allege that a larger
 number of people disappeared -- perhaps 28 or more.
 Most Argentine observers believe that many of those who
 disappeared had active links to terrorist organizations.
 There were also cases of suspected terrorists being placed
 before the courts when, in the past, they might simply
 have disappeared. Two people who reportedly disappeared
 in 1980 were Paraguayan communists living clandestinely
 as refugees in Argentina.
 Amnesty International and other human rights organizations
 charge that Argentine security forces participated in
 a widely publicized disappearance in June 1980 of four
 Argentines in Lima, Peru. The Argentine government has
 denied any role in their disappearance.
 
 
 332
 The authorities have not yet accounted for the people
 who disappeared in the past. Government spokesmen have
 suggested that the bulk of the disappeared are dead.
 Noting the statements of former detainees who report
 that most of their fellows were executed, as well as
 lack of evidence to the contrary, most observers also
 believe that the great bulk of the disappeared are dead.
 A 1979 law shortening the period for a court finding
 of presumptive death has alleviated some personal hardships
 in legal and financial matters for the survivors of the
 disappeared. The law drew sharp criticism from Argentine
 human rights organizations, relatives, and the European
 Parliament, because of fears the government would misuse
 it to close arbitrarily cases of disappearances. There
 have been no reports that the law in fact has been abused
 by the authorities. The government has now explicitly
 restricted the terms of the law to assure against potential
 official misuse. The Inter-American Human Rights Commission
 in its 1980 report has recommended that Argentina, to
 prevent new disappearances, should create a central register
 of detainees.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and-Imprisonment
 The Argentine constitution, in article 23, established
 the power of the executive branch to-detain and hold
 prisoners under a state of siege (which has been in effect
 since 1974). The powers derived under this provision,
 as well as the prisoners held under its authority, are
 often described with the adjective PEN, the Spanish acronym
 for the National Executive Power (Poder Ejecutivo Nacional).
 The constitution places no explicit time limit for holding
 prisoners under the PEN powers. The supreme court, overruling
 a number of lower court decisions, has accepted broad
 and unsubstantiated charges of association with subversion,
 as sufficient grounds for indefinite PEN detention.
 Some PEN prisoners have been in jail without charge for
 several years -- including a significant number detained
 before 1976.
 Since 1974, 8,200-persons accused of terrorism or subversion
 have been detained under the special executive powers
 of the president. By December 198,0, those held on other
 than common criminal charges totalled about 1,550. Of
 these, about 600 had been tried and convicted in military
 or civilian courts, another 400 were in trial status,
 and about 550 were being held without trial and/or charges,
 some for many years or even after having served their
 sentences. The minister of interior said 300 are being
 held without charges. In December 1980 the government
 acknowledged that approximately 900 persons remain under
 PEN detention. The Argentine government informed the
 OAS General Assembly that in 1980 eight persons were
 detained under PEN powers; of these, six were referred
 to normal judicial procedures and two were released under
 parole conditions. The government has set up a system
 to review periodically all pending cases, and 888 persons
 were removed from PEN detention in 1980. The International
 Committee of the Red Cross has maintained a regular program
 of prison visits.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Persons accused of subversion or terrorism may be tried
 in either civilian or military courts. Civilian courts
 follow Argentina's customary legal provisions regarding
 open and fair trials. Argentine law, however, requires
 written rather than oral testimony, so that "operF has
 a different meaning and different consequences from those
 
 
 333
 in other legal systems. The law provides that the civilian
 courts are independent, but the pressures accompanying
 trials involving subversion and terrorism have made it
 difficult for the courts to maintain independence. Military
 tribunals, before which civilians may be tried, conduct
 their proceedings in secret. The defendants have access
 only to a military defense counsel who is usually not
 a lawyer. Defendants legally may be kept unaware of
 the evidence against them in both military and civilian
 proceedings. The Argentine government, in its report
 to the OAS General Assembly, stated that in 1980 157
 persons were sentenced for crimes related to terrorism;
 154 sentences were handed down by civilian courts and
 three by military courts.
 Lawyers in the past generally have been reluctant to
 defend people charged with terrorism or subversion, fearing
 harassment or reprisals. The New York City Bar Association,
 following its visit to Argentina in April 1979, concluded
 that in 1975-1978 some lawyers disappeared or were detained
 if they defended clients and causes unpopular with the
 government. Over the past two years, no lawyers disappeared
 or were detained for such reasons, and it appears that
 the profession is operating more securely than in the
 past.
 The independence of the courts is provided for in the
 constitution. In 1976, however, the government replaced
 all members of the supreme court and removed a number
 of judges id lower courts, though most were retained.
 The courts have often upheld executive interpretations
 of laws and of the constitution, and they have not success-
 fully clarified the fate of any of the disappearances
 brought to their attention. However, there have been
 instances when the courts successfully challenged govern-
 ment actions and interpretations of its powers. In 1980,
 the supreme court ordered the courts to investigate disap-
 pearances fully when there is evidence suggesting govern-
 ment forces may have been involved. It remains to be
 seen whether the lower courts will be effective in carrying
 out the supreme court's directive. The 1980 report of
 the Inter-American Human Rights Commission recommends
 specific measures to assure legal due process guarantees.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home has traditionally been protected
 by Argentine law, custom, and practice. The security
 forces, however, have often violated that sanctity during
 their anti-terrorist and anti-subversive operations.
 Available information suggests that violation of the
 home's sanctity still occurs, although the number of
 instances appears to have dropped sharply in 1980.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education
 Argentina enjoys a high standard of living. In 1979
 per capita income in current dollars was an estimated
 $3,400, and Argentine governments have -- within the
 economic constraints of recent years - sought to confront
 social needs. Of total central government expenditures
 in 1979, 10.1 percent went to education, three percent
 to public health and 4.5 percent to housing. Infant
 mortality in 1970-79 was 59 per 1,000 births. Life expectancy
 is 69.4 years. There is one physician for every 530
 
 
 334
 persons, and a hospital bed for every 170. In 1978 94
 percent of the adult population was literate.
 Argentina to date continues to maintain close to full
 employment. Official unemployment in Argentina was two
 percent in 1980, although some observers believe that
 there is some hidden unemployment. Argentina has tradition-
 ally enjoyed relatively equal distribution of income
 although it has become less equal in recent years, in
 part as a result of government policies designed to reduce
 inflation and revitalize the country's productive sector.
 Toward that end, the government has made an effort to
 open the economy to external competition by lowering
 tariff protection, reducing subsidies, and limiting state
 involvement in the economy. These policies, which greatly
 increased imports and discouraged exports, have recently
 resulted in a number of bankruptcies, belt-tightening
 for lower and some middle-income groups, and growing
 complaints from the private sector. The economy is current-
 ly in a period of reduced growth. Inflation continues
 to decline but is still high, running at about 90 percent
 for 1980, partly because of deliberate government policy
 to maintain full employment and to provide substantial
 increases in real wages of public sector employees over
 the past several years. This has contributed to upward
 pressure on wages and prices throughout the economy.
 Education has been free and is widely available, though
 the government is now moving to require tuition for university-
 level education. Government, private and trade union medical
 care programs make treatment available and affordable to
 most of the population.
 Property ownership and transaction is a right of citizens.
 There is a serious housing shortage in Argentina, most of
 it attributable to now-defunct legislation that sustained
 rent control guidelines. The tax system is progressive
 and tax collections are increasingly effective, though com-
 pliance remains a problem.
 Argentine women generally enjoy equal juridical status with
 men. Women's rights are not a contentious issue in Argentina,
 as jobs and educational opportunities, along with support
 systems that facilitate the simultaneous handling of job
 and family, are available, at least in urban areas. Sex
 discrimination is prohibited in education, politics, and
 employment. Tradition and social customs still limit women's
 participation in the work force.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The Argentine constitution nrovides for these freedoms,
 but they have been circumscribed since the imposition of
 the state of siege in 1974. In 1980, exercise of freedom
 of speech and assembly expanded, although political leaders
 still risk arrest if they overstep the uncertain and undefined
 bounds of permitted political activity and statements.
 Civilian political leaders in 1980 commented extensively
 on the government's political dialogue, on its promise to
 issue a new law which will allow political parties to reorga-
 nize and renew their leadership, and on other government
 policies and actions.   Included among the latter were the
 economic situation and human rights issues, including account-
 ing for the disappeared. On the other hand, meetings of
 party leaders are sometimes prohibited or disrupted by the
 police and the participants detained, usually for brief
 
 
 335
 periods. A regional political leader recently was arrested
 for violating the government's ban on political party activity,
 and a senior national political leader was detained and
 questioned after he reportedly criticized the government.
 The right of assembly for political groups has been suspended
 since March 1976 although, as noted above, the government
 has permitted a gradual increase of organized.political
 activities by established political parties. Marxist parties
 to the left of thd communists have been banned.
 The press is not legally subject to prior official censorship
 except for moral content. However, government-imposed guide-
 lines result in self-censorship. The Argentine Publishers'
 Association, after its annual meeting in 1980, issued a
 statement that "it is impossible to state that press freedom
 exists in Argentina.* In the past, journalists have been
 among the Argentines who disappeared. Some are currently
 under detention. The government has intervened or confiscated
 a number of newspapers, notably La Opinion.  Nevertheless,
 newspapers actively criticize the government in many areas
 and report the remarks of opposition politicians. Coverage
 of such issues as human rights and the disappearances increased
 during 1980. In August a declaration signed by 180 prominent
 Argentines calling for clarification of the whereabouts
 of disappeared persons was published in a prominent daily
 newspaper. Most foreign publications enter Argentina without
 censorship.
 The Argentine constitution requires that the president be
 a member of the Catholic Church, and the majority of Argentines
 profess this faith. Other religions are required to register
 with the government; all but the Jehovah's Witnesses are
 permitted to function, and there are substatutial minority
 religious groups, including a 300,000-450,000 member Jewish
 community. The government publicly condemns religious prejudice.
 Argentine Jews have well-developed community organizations,
 exercise their religion without restraints and participate
 fully in Argentine economic and cultural life. The government
 maintains correct relations with the Jewish community and
 there is no evidence of official anti-Semitic policy, although
 incidents of anti-Semitism occur. During the height of
 the "dirty war" there were credible reports of anti-Semitic
 behavior by the security forces and persecution of Jewish
 prisoners. Virulent anti-Semitic literature remains on
 sale in the country and openly anti-Semitic attitudes have
 been tolerated in state-controlled television. Several
 Jewish schools were bombed in July and August and more received
 anonymous threats. Though the culprits were never found,
 the government sought to reassure Argentine Jews.
 Until the end of 1980, the government continued to refuse
 to permit the legal registration of the Jehovah's Witnesses,
 who number approximately 30,000 in Argentina. Their properties
 and meeting places have been closed, and some Witness children
 have been expelled from provincial school systems for refusing
 to salute the flag and sing the national anthem. The supreme
 court has ruled that two expelled primary school children
 should be allowed to return to school. In December 1980
 the government revoked a decree which had precluded the
 Jehovah's Witnesses from seeking formal registration.
 Several human rights organizations, uniting activists and
 relatives of the disappeared, have played a significant
 role in Argentina over the past several years. Some leaders
 of these groups were severely.harassed and threatened in
 the past and several activists disappeared. In 1980 it
 appeared that the organizations were operating in a climate
 
 
 336
 of enhanced security though there continued to be occasional
 harassment. The government in 1980 reaffirmed the right
 of human rights organizations to conduct their activities
 freely, and praised those groups that directed their efforts
 toward humanitarian rather than political goals. The
 "Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo" -- relatives of disappeared
 persons -- who used to assemble in front of the ministry
 of the interior in the Plaza de Mayo, were forcibly prevented
 from using the Plaza late in 1978, and in December 1980
 a demonstration by human rights activists, including relatives
 of the disappeared, was broken up by the police with the
 use of considerable force. Twenty-seven demonstrators were
 arrested.
 b. Freedom of Movement Mithin the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Argentine citizens are free to travel without restriction
 within the country and are free to emigrate. Married women
 living in Argentina must have the .permission of their husbands
 to travel abroad with their children if the husband is not
 accompanying them. The Argentine constitution permits PEN
 prisoners to choose self-exile. Exercise of this "right
 of option" was denied by the current government until 1978
 and subsequently restricted through implementation of an
 extensive screening process for all applicants. Many applica-
 tions were denied during 1980, even though the applicants
 held documents authorizing them to enter other countries.
 Of the 711 cases handled thus far under the United States
 refugee program, 277 have been released.
 Argentina has accepted about 300 Indochinese and eleven
 Cuban refugees.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Most elements of the democratic political process remained
 legally suspended in 1980. The governmentts declared intention
 is to return the nation to constitutional democracy but
 it has not established a timetable for realizing that goal.
 The government, in late 1979, promulgated a "political plan"
 containing broad guidelines for the eventual return of the
 country to civilian rule. In 1980, under the leadership
 of the minister of the interior, the government began a
 "dialogue" with many of the nation's political leaders.
 By the end of October, 41 meetings at the national level
 and 189 meetings at the provincial level had been held.
 Among the stated purposes of the dialogue is the development
 of legislation permitting the resumption of political party
 activity. As of December 1980, implementing legislation
 had not been.issued although the dialogue with political
 leaders continues. In the meantime, the military designated
 another military president to serve until March 1984.
 The government has subjected major trade unions to its
 intervention, replacing high-level union officials with
 military personnel, and prohibiting strikes. In 1976, and
 again in mid-1979, during periods of labor tension, the
 government detained a number of important labor leaders
 (almost all of these have since been released). Nevertheless,
 strikes for wage increases have occurred, and nearly all
 have been settled without violence.
 In late 1979, after more than three years of study, the
 government issued a new trade union organization law and
 laid the groundwork for lifting the suspension of union
 activities which has been in effect since the armed forces
 took power in 1976. The law calls for the definitive dissolu-
 tion of the old national confederation (CGT) and other "tertiary"
 
 
 337
 organizations which have been under government control since
 1976. Although the law makes no provision for such tertiary
 organizations, an informal national labor leadership continues
 to operate. It is not clear when the government will lift
 the suspension of the rights to strike and bargain collectively.
 From the government's point of view, the new law is designed
 to introduce more grass roots democracy and freedom of associa-
 tion for the workers than existed in the past; labor leaders,
 on the other hand, see it as an emasculation of union power,
 as it proscribes all political activity and greatly restricts
 control over social funds. The procedural steps for the
 implementation of the new law will not be clarified until
 the ministry of labor issues detailed regulations. The
 ICFTU condemned the law as a violation of union rights.
 Although enjoying no official standing or recognition by
 the government, several labor groupings are active in making
 their views known. For example, they oppose the government's
 trade union law on grounds that it restricts freedom of
 association and the right to organize as defined in conventions
 87 and 98 of the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 as ratified by the Argentine government. They also oppose
 the new law's prohibition against political action by trade
 unions. The Inter-American Human Rights Commission has
 recommended the repeal or amendment of laws that prevent
 the normal development of trade unions. The Argentine govern-
 ment informed the OAS General Assembly that in 1980 Argentina
 filed regular reports with the ILO's Committee on Trade
 Union Freedom, which has noted progress.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 In late 1978, the Argentine government invited the Inter-
 American Human Rights Commission (IAHRC) to visit Argentina.
 That visit took place from September 6 to 20, 1979. The
 Commission met with President Videla and other high-level
 officials, took testimony from family members of disappeared
 persons and from former prisoners, and visited several prisons
 and detention centers. The IAHRC recorded a past pattern
 of wide-scale human rights abuses, including violations
 by the government regarding the right to life, personal
 security, personal liberty, due process, and freedom of
 opinion, expression and association. The IAHRC also noted,
 however, that the Argentine government cooperated fully
 with the Commission during its visit and, that with the
 exception of the Jehovah's Witnesses, freedom of religion
 prevails in Argentina. It reported that there is no official
 policy of anti-Semitism, though in some instances Jews have
 been the subject of discrimination. The IAHRC formulated
 a series of recommendations to the Argentine government
 for correcting the abuses it had observed. These recommenda-
 tions included trial and punishment for those responsible
 for deaths attributable to the government, an official account-
 ing for the disappeared, effective implementation of habeas
 corpus procedures, punishment of those responsible for torture,
 release or trial of those being held under PEN, improvement
 in prison conditions, effective guarantees of legal defense
 and due process, restoration of political rights, observance
 of trade union rights, lifting of prohibitions against Jehovah's
 Witnesses, investigation and punishment of discrimination
 against Jews, and facilitating the efforts of human rights
 organizations.
 Argentina took strong exception to the Commission's report.
 In its 220 page response, it argued that the Commission
 infringed on the rights of a sovereign state, did not meet
 
 
 338
 minimum standards of justice and objectivity and, rather
 than seeking to determine the facts of the situation, sought
 to establish already predetermined exaggerated and inaccurate
 conclusions. The .government claimed that the IAHRC's report
 failed to reflect an understanding of the violence and social
 unrest existing prior to the military's takeover nor did
 its conclusions reflect the improved human rights situation
 at the time of the Commission's visit. Thus, asserted the
 government, while Argentina did not seek to avoid the report's
 criticisms and had welcomed the Commission's visit, the
 report left a false impression of human rights conditions
 in Argentina.
 The special IAHRC report on Argentina was considered by
 the Organization of American States General Assembly held
 in Washington, D.C. November 19 - 27, 1980. Argentina,
 in an informative note, reported actions taken in 1980 to
 improve the human rights situation, including a gradual
 decrease in the number of new persons detained by the
 executive, and a system for periodic review of pending cases,
 improved prison conditions, a decrease in the number of
 individuals said to have disappeared and official efforts
 to clarify the circumstances, an increase in judicial
 effectiveness, the devolution of state controlled media
 into private hands, the reaffirmation of the right of human
 rights organizations to conduct their activities freely,
 cooperation with the ILO, and efforts taken to restore
 political rights. The OAS approved a resolution specifying
 Argentina, as well as five other countries in which human
 rights violations had been discussed in either the IAHRC
 annual report or in special reports, and urged member states
 that had not yet done so to correct remaining violations.
 Although the subject of prolonged debate, the resolution
 was adopted by consensus.
 The United Nations Commission on Human Rights is consider-
 ing the situation of human rights in Argentina under its
 confidential 1503 procedures. A working group on disappear-
 ances is inquiring into cases of disappearances in Argentina
 and other countries. The International Committee of the
 Red Cross (ICRC) maintains an active program in Argentina,
 with government approval, on behalf of imprisoned persons.
 The government has usually facilitated the efforts of various
 groups and individuals seeking to investigate allegations
 of human rights abuse.
