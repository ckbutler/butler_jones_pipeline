 BRAZIL
 Brazil returned to full democratic rule in 1985. Jose Sarney,
 chosen as Vice President by the electoral college in January,
 became President in April following the death of the
 President-elect.
 With the return of democracy, the Brazilian Congress approved
 amendments to remove immediately a number of the more
 authoritarian provisions in the 1967 Constitution. The center
 of political power continues to be the Presidency, which
 enjoys various constitutional and legal devices providing
 decisive authority within the Brazilian legal framework. The
 Congress, most of which was popularly elected in 1982, plays
 an increasingly active role in national policy-making. The
 Brazilian judiciary is a respected and independent institution
 and is largely successful in guaranteeing due process of law
 for most citizens.
 1985 was a year of economic recovery, with growth expected to
 be around 7 percent. Brazil is the eighth largest economy in
 the non-Communist world, but it must cope with a foreign debt
 of nearly 100 billion dollars and high inflation (over 200
 percent in 1985 and in each of the 2 previous years). The 3
 years prior to 1984 were years of severe recession, and per
 capita gross national product declined substantially. The
 Brazilian Government has been able to adjust the economy's
 external sector to current international financial conditions,
 as shown by the large growth in its trade surplus.
 The state of human rights continued to improve in 1985,
 reinforcing the long-term trend. Brazilians are largely free
 to participate in the political and economic life of the
 country. The President may, however, invoke constitutionally
 sanctioned emergency powers and has authority to issue
 decree-laws. Although a decree-law enters into effect
 immediately, it must then be submitted to Congress, which has
 60 days to approve or reject it. President Sarney has issued
 several decree-laws, but recently stated his intention to
 cease this practice.
 Under the current civil code, Brazilian Indians are considered
 1semi-competent" wards of the State and live under certain
 restrictions and protections which are not applicable to other
 citizens. Indians living on a number of reservations are
 under pressure from mineral and agricultural developers, as
 well as squatters and legitimate settlers, to open more of
 their lands to others.
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings in 1985. However,
 there have been charges by human rights organizations that
 police in Rio and Sao Paulo have killed individuals suspected
 of common crimes. The National Conference of Brazilian
 Bishops (CNBB) notes that the situation in Rio has improved in
 recent years. While these killings apparently still continue,
 they are not politically motivated and police participation is
 unclear. The church perceives no similar improvement in Sao
 Paulo over the past several years and believes insufficient
 resources have been devoted by local or state government to
 combat the problem. Many of the more than 200 criminals
 
 
 440
 BRAZIL
 reported as killed annually in confrontations with Sao Paulo
 police are believed by human rights activists to have been
 killed after capture. The situation has been complicated by
 an alarming rise in the rate of violent crime in Rio and Sao
 Paulo, which has led to a high degree of public tolerance of
 charges of police brutality toward suspects.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports of politically motivated
 abductions. However, Sao Paulo human rights groups report the
 disappearance of 15 alleged common criminals from police
 custody since December 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by the penal code, and there have been
 no reports of politically motivated torture in 1985. However,
 various human rights and professional organizations report
 that police beatings and torture of individuals suspected of
 common crimes are widespread, the primary purpose apparently
 being to extract confessions. Such practices primarily affect
 the underprivileged. Although church authorities in Rio noted
 a steady decline in such offenses in 1983-84, due to
 government efforts to curb mistreatment of suspects, there was
 no evidence of further significant improvement during 1985.
 In Sao Paulo, the practice reportedly remains widespread with
 little change over the past several years. Human rights
 activists in both Rio and Sao Paulo maintain that the dominant
 factor sustaining these abuses by police is the perception
 that they can act with impunity. Although little improvement
 was noted in 1985, there is guarded optimism that the sense of
 impunity is fading, due in part to several nationally reported
 judicial proceedings against police involved in torture and
 killings.
 Many prison facilities continue to be overcrowded and poorly
 maintained and managed. The state of Sao Paulo is now engaged
 in a major construction program of medium-security regional
 prisons. There has been no such investment in Rio, leading to
 resignations in September of the director of the State
 Penitentiary System and principal prison wardens. The worst
 cases of sub-human prison conditions which have come to recent
 attention are the "prisoner deposits" in urban Minas Gerais,
 where an infamous death lottery among prisoners has developed,
 supposedly to call public attention to the overcrowded
 conditions. (Some 20 prisoners were killed by fellow inmates
 in these cells during 1985.) The state of Minas Gerais has
 transferred some of the more hardened criminals and has begun
 construction of a new maximum-security prison, the first
 investment in the penal system in 30 years, but poor
 conditions persist.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The independent judiciary is largely successful in
 guaranteeing due process of law for most citizens, although
 delivery of justice to economically marginalized groups is
 incomplete. Under the law, an individual may not be
 arbitrarily detained. Habeas corpus is guaranteed by the
 Constitution and is respected.
 Provisional detention is permissible under criminal law. It
 is ordered by judges (in cases of common crimes) or by certain
 
 
 441
 BRAZIL
 high-level administrative authorities (in cases of crimes
 against the public administration or of extradition), not by
 the police. For example, a judge may order provisional
 detention to preserve public order when there is evidence of
 probable cause, when the accused is considered dangerous or
 does not have a fixed job or address, or when the individual
 is caught in the act of an unbailable crime. Detention may
 also be ordered to prevent interference by the accused in
 criminal proceedings, e.g., when the individual might
 influence or harm witnesses. Provisional detention can be
 extended until the case comes to trial or until a judge rules
 that reasons for the detention no longer exist. Provisional
 detention in Brazil is not practiced arbitrarily and does not
 normally lead to longer periods of incarceration.
 Forced or compulsory labor is not used in Brazil by any
 official or government organization. During 1985, several
 accusations were made that individual landowners in the states
 of Bahia and Acre have maintained a "slave" work force,
 usually through methods such as discounting salaries against
 transportation and other expenses and of preventing workers
 from leaving the property. When these practices have been
 exposed to authorities, action has been taken to secure
 release of the persons.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is guaranteed by law for both
 penal code and National Security Law violations and is
 respected in practice. Defendants are entitled to counsel and
 must be made fully aware of the charges against them. In
 cases where a defendant cannot afford an attorney, one must be
 provided free of charge. However, there are too few public
 defenders,'and thousands of criminal cases are now
 backlogged. Defendants and their attorneys have the legal
 right to be informed of the evidence on which the charges are
 based. Cases may be tried before a single judge or by jury,
 except in the cases of willful crimes against life, in which
 case a jury trial is mandated.
 Numerous lynchings have been reported in the press and the
 phenomenon is apparently increasing. The greatest incidence
 of lynching takes place in the slums on the outskirts of major
 cities, a result of perceptions that police and court
 protection is unavailable.
 The Brazilian judicial system is an independent branch of
 government. The federal court system of Brazil is composed of
 courts of the first instance and appeals courts. The Federal
 Supreme Court is the highest court in the land. The states
 are free to organize their own judicial systems as long as
 they do not violate basic principles of the federal
 Constitution. Brazil also has a system of specialized courts
 such as labor courts, electoral courts, and juvenile courts.
 The military court system is charged with the responsibility
 of hearing cases involving military personnel and cases
 involving civilians charged under the National Security Law or
 with offenses against military installations. Legal
 guarantees also apply in military courts. Civilians have the
 right to appeal to the Federal Supreme Court when convicted of
 crimes against the National Security Law. Military personnel
 also may appeal to the Federal Supreme Court in national
 security cases, but only in extraordinary circumstances. The
 
 
 442
 BRAZIL
 Minister of Justice has stated that civilians will not be
 charged under the law pending its revision. At present, no
 one is imprisoned in Brazil under the National Security Law.
 Two cases are still pending for attempts to organize Communist
 parties. As Communist parties are now legal, it is expected
 that these cases will end in dismissal or acquittals, as did a
 similar case in 1985.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 Forced entry into homes without a warrant probably still
 occurs in searches for criminals, but this practice has
 declined in recent years, according to human rights
 organizations. There are no reports of such illegal entries
 of homes in political cases. Freedom from search is a
 constitutionally guaranteed right.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The right to free speech and to a free press are guaranteed in
 the Constitution. Opposition viewpoints are aired freely in
 various media. There has been no interference with the media
 by the new Government.
 Newspapers are privately owned and are vigorous in reporting
 on and discussing government policies and performance.
 Self-censorship is rare. The Inter-American Press Association
 listed Brazil as having a "free press."
 Radio and television stations are also privately owned, but
 the Government can withdraw their licenses fairly easily. The
 current administration plans to review all licenses issued
 during the last 6 months of the previous Government.
 Electronic media broadcasts covered a vast array of topics,
 including controversial social and political issues during
 1985.
 Foreign publications are widely distributed in Brazil. A
 restrictive censorship law still exists, but the provisions
 being observed apply mainly to age restrictions. A new law is
 being developed which is expected to concentrate on protection
 of minors from harmful influences, including narcotics and
 pornography. Books and newspapers are not censored, and
 films, songs, and plays are no longer reviewed for political
 content. Prescreening reviews of films and television
 programming continue but only for determining the acceptable
 viewing age.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees the right to peaceful assembly,
 and the right is observed. Although permits must be obtained
 for outdoor public, political or labor meetings they are
 normally freely given.
 Labor has the right to organize and to meet freely; labor
 unions are legally mandated under the code of labor laws to
 represent workers. Although the labor code makes no provision
 for a central or umbrella labor organization, two rival
 centrals have emerged. The founding of a third was announced
 in September 1985. The Government has not officially
 
 
 443
 BRAZIL
 recognized their right to function but engages in regular
 dialogue with central leaders. To maintain the official labor
 structure, workers are taxed 1 day's pay per year, a sum which
 is paid to the Government and then divided among
 confederations, federations, and local unions. Perhaps 10 to
 15 percent of workers voluntarily pay union dues in addition
 to the mandatory tax. Most of these voluntary members join
 more for family health benefits than for representation
 regarding wages or working conditions. Although unions are
 legally prohibited from participating in partisan politics, a
 number do but with little impact to date.
 The Government has not acted to prohibit strikes, even though
 existing legislation makes strikes all but illegal and has not
 enforced other restrictions on labor unions. In addition, the
 Government has reinstated the right of all labor leaders to
 hold union office.
 Employers have a legally mandated structure which parallels
 that of labor, and there are also voluntary employer
 organizations not mandated by law. Both types of associations
 represent their members to the Government, act as lobbyists,
 and negotiate collective bargaining agreements with labor
 unions.
 Unions of workers and employers may maintain ties with
 international organizations, but each affiliation has to be
 approved by the President of Brazil and, because of exchange
 controls, the transfer of funds to pay membership charges has
 to pass through the Central Bank. The President and Central
 Bank have a number of applications pending for association and
 transfer of funds.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no favored or state religion. An overwhelming
 majority of Brazilians belong to the Roman Catholic Church.
 All faiths are free to proselytize, establish places of
 worship, and train clergy. According to the National Council
 of Brazilian Bishops (CNBB), missionaries and other foreign
 religious visitors have had difficulty entering Brazil in
 recent years due to the passage of a new immigration law in
 1980. The CNBB does not believe that missionaries and
 religious visitors are being singled out, but rather that all
 foreigners are equally affected. Plans to revise the
 immigration law have been announced by the Government. The
 Catholic Church continued its political and social activism
 during 1985, with no government intervention.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within Brazil, nor are
 there any unusual restrictions on emigration. Brazil admits
 few immigrants, basing its decision on its ability to absorb
 newcomers, cultural affinity and proximity of the applicant's
 homeland. Brazil is selective in granting asylum, and precise
 criteria do not exist.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change their Government
 On March 15, 1985, Brazil s first civilian president in 21
 years was inaugurated. With the acquiescence of military
 
 
 444
 BRAZIL
 leaders, two civilian presidential candidates were chosen, one
 a former governor of Sao Paulo with close ties to the
 military-dominated Government, and the other a long-time
 civilian opposition leader. The opposition leader, Tancredo
 Neves, was chosen as President in indirect elections in
 January by an electoral college composed of the Federal
 Congress and six representatives of each state legislature.
 His running mate, Jose Sarney, former President of the
 government party and long-time civilian politician, was
 elected Vice President. Although efforts to establish direct
 presidential elections failed, the indirect election of Neves
 through the electoral college was widely hailed as a complete
 return to civilian democracy. Neves was hospitalized for
 emergency abdominal surgery on the eve of his inauguration,
 and Sarney became interim president. Subsequently, Neves
 died, and Sarney was confirmed with full presidential
 authority.
 Although the military-inspired 1967 Constitution concentrates
 effective political power in the Presidency, Sarney has
 followed a more consensual style of government. The
 President's constitutional powers include the right to issue
 decree-laws in a number of key areas and, in the event of an
 outbreak of war or threat of serious disturbances, to decree a
 state of siege which permits suspension of many civil rights.
 The Federal Congress, with the support of the Presidency, in
 May passed constitutional amendments removing numerous
 authoritarian restrictions. The major changes provided for
 direct presidential elections, direct elections of mayors in
 all cities (mayors of state capitals and of cities in national
 security areas had previously been appointed by state
 governors), enfranchisement of illiterates (approximately 25
 percent of the adult population), and liberalized political
 party registration. Liberalization of party registration has
 resulted in legalization of two Communist parties and
 increased the total number of political parties to 30,
 representing the entire political spectrum.
 The direct election of Federal Congressmen and Senators in
 November 1982 produced a popularly representative congress
 with direct influence in the decisionmaking process. Congress
 now exercises a larger role than it has for the past 2
 decades. A new constitution will be drafted by a constituent
 assembly in 1987. It is expected that membership in the
 constituent assembly will be the same as that of the Federal
 Congress which will convene after the November 1986
 elections. Those elections will fill all seats in the Chamber
 of Deputies and two-thirds of those in the Senate. State
 governors have been directly elected since 1982, as have all
 municipal, state, and most federal legislators. (There are
 still a few nonelected federal senators who were appointed
 before 1982.) As of the November 1985 mayoral elections, all
 mayors are now directly elected. Voting is secret and
 mandatory for all adults.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no outside requests in 1985 from international
 human rights organizations to investigate conditions in Brazil.
 There are a number of Brazilian nongovernmental organizations,
 such as the National Bar Association and the Brazilian Press
 
 
 BRAZIL
 Association, which are active in investigating alleged human
 rights violations and in initiating legal proceedings. Amnesty
 International maintains offices in Rio and Sao Paulo. There
 have been no claims by any of these organizations that the
 Government has tried to impede their investigations. There is
 a consensus among human rights observers in Brazil that the
 human rights situation has improved dramatically over the past
 several years. They believe that the main problems now
 concern police behavior toward suspects, prison conditions,
 and certain economic rights. The Federal Solicitor-General in
 1985 designated a Federal Prosecutor in each state to monitor
 and assist in denunciations of violations of human rights.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 In 1984, Brazil's population of approximately 135 million grew
 at the rate of 2.5 to 3 percent. The gross domestic product
 rose by approximately 4.5 percent, after 3 consecutive years
 of economic recession. GNP per capita at the end of 1983 was
 US$1,880 (World Bank. estimate), more than 10 percent less than
 that of 1980.. (Brazilian Government figures show a 1983 GNP
 per capita of US$1,628.) Continued rapid expansion of exports
 produced a 13 billion trade surplus in 1984. Economic growth
 continued in 1985, with GNP up byzbetween 6 and 7 percent.
 The 1985 trade surplus is expected to be. about $12 billion.
 Expansion in 1985 has brought real wage increases and some
 reduction in the rate of unemployment. However, persistent
 high inflation (surpassing 200 percent annually since 1983),
 rapid demographic growth, and the pressures of Brazil's high
 debt service will continue to limit improvements in living
 standards.
 Although evidence suggests that all social strata benefited
 from the country's economic growth during the 1970's, uneven
 income distribution was exacerabated and remains a serious
 social concern. Brazil continues to have a large
 rural-to-urban migration. Seventy percent of the population
 lives within 100 kilometers of the coast, and nearly 30
 percent are concentrated in nine urban areas. The Government
 encourages settlement in the western frontier areas.
 Life expectancy at birth is estimated at 65 years, and infant
 mortality 65 per 1,000 live births. However, officials in
 several northeastern states estimate their infant mortality
 rates at well over 200, primarily due to the area's chronic
 poverty and substandard health facilities. Health personnel
 and health facilities are concentrated in urban areas.
 Significant portions of the society lack adequate nutrition,
 basic education, and medical care. An estimated 29 percent of
 the population lacks access to safe water. Illustrative of
 these problems are the findings of a 1980 Brazilian
 congressional inquiry which indicated that Brazil has 2
 million abandoned children and 18 to 25 million children
 without.the basic necessities of life. The Ministry of
 Education estimates that some 7 million school-age children
 are not.enrolled in the educational system. Government
 figures show that 21 percent of the economically active
 population has less than 2 years of education. Official
 figures indicated that in 1980 16 percent of the urban
 population over age 10 was illiterate, as was 46 percent of
 the same segment of the rural population.
 Minimum age for employment is 12, but numerous legal
 restrictions theoretically apply to all working minors (those
 
 
 446
 BRAZIL
 under age 18). Permission of parents or guardians is legally
 required for minors to work. Children from 12 to 14 are
 legally allowed to work only if provision is made for them to
 attend school through completion of primary education, and
 only in light work that does not constitute a physical
 strain. All minors face restrictions in night employment and
 are prohibited from employment in unhealthy, dangerous, or
 morally injurious conditions. These laws do not extend to the
 types of occasional employment performed by millions of
 children and adolescents. Thirty-four percent of all children
 between 10 and 14 are considered economically active, and 65
 percent of Brazilians between 15 and 17 are employed. Brazil
 has a highly codified system of labor regulations, providing
 restrictions concerning workplace safety, a 48-hour maximum
 work week, specified periods of rest and vacation, and a
 standardized minimum wage. Official accident figures show an
 annual injury rate of approximately 4 percent, with 4,500
 workplace deaths for 25 million insured workers. Regulations
 concerning workplace safety are detailed, but enforcement
 suffers from an inadequate inspection staff.
 The minimum wage, which is defined as that "able to satisfy
 the normal necessities of the worker and his family," averages
 approximately $50 per month; its purchasing power fluctuates
 considerably because it is raised only twice a year despite
 high inflation. An interunion statistical organization
 calculates that the minimum necessary for a decent standard of
 living for a family is 3 to 4 times greater than the official
 minimum salary. In 1983, 43 percent of those economically
 active earned less than one minimum salary; only 30 percent of
 all workers earned more than three minimum salaries.
 Discrimination on the basis of sex and race is illegal.
 Nevertheless, the number of women and members of most minority
 groups in the governing structure is much smaller than their
 proportional share of the population, a reflection of
 prevailing cultural attitudes and economic disparities. Women
 are proportionally represented among university students.
 The country's estimated 200,000 Indians, living mostly in the
 interior, have suffered in recent decades from population
 movements by Non-Indians into frontier areas where most
 Indians live. Despite the Government's commitment under the
 1973 Indian Statute to protect the Indian population and
 efforts of the Federal Indian Affairs Agency to demarcate
 tribal lands, the Indian population continues to suffer from
 governmental neglect, discriminatory governmental controls,
 and unequal legal status.
