 VENEZUELA
 Venezuela is a republic with an active multiparty democratic system, a free press,
 well-established unions, and a longstanding commitment to democracy. These fac-
 tors enabled the country to withstand two attempted coups in 1992 and the im-
 peachment of a President in 1993. Over three decades of two-party dominance ended
 in 1994 when former President Rafael Caldera was sworn in as President with the
 support of a coalition of small and medium-sized parties. Four major political
 groupings now comprise the Congress. On July 6, the Government reinstated con-
 stitutional guarantees which it had suspended in June 1994, allegedly because of
 the need to combat subversion and to address the country's financial crisis. The
 freedoms from arbitrary arrest and detention and search without warrant were re-
 stored, as were freedom to travel, to pursue profitable activities, the right to own
 private property, and to receive compensation for assets confiscated by the State.
 However, three of the constitutional suspensions remained in effect in some border
 areas.
 The security apparatus comprises civilian and military elements, both accountable
 to elected authorities. The National Guard, a branch of the military, has arrest pow-
 ers and is largely responsible for guarding the exterior of prisons and key govern-
 ment installations, maintaining order during times of civil unrest, monitoring fron-
 tiers, and providing law enforcement in remote areas. It also supplies the top lead-
 ership for the Metropolitan Police, the main civilian police force in and around Cara-
 cas, and for various state and municipal police forces. The Interior Ministry controls
 the State Security Police (DISIP) which is primarily responsible for protecting public
 officials and investigating cases of subversion and arms trafficking. The Justice
 Ministry controls the Judicial Technical Police (PTJ) which conducts most criminal
 investigations. Both police and military personnel were responsible for human rights
 abuses.
 The public sector, including the petroleum industry which accounts for some 22
 percent of the gross domestic product, dominates the economy. In response to a fi-
 nancial crisis, the Government maintained control over half the banking sector. Al-
 though the Government sharply devalued the national currency on December 11, it
 retained foreign exchange and price controls and continued to restrict severely the
 availability of foreign exchange. Continuing fiscal and monetary difficulties, as well
 as a drop in international reserves, led Venezuela to begin negotiations on an eco-
 nomic stibilization program with the International Monetary Fund in late 1995.
 The Government's human rights record continued to be poor in certain areas and
 included extrajudicial killings by the police and military, torture and abuse of de-
 tainees, failure to punish police and security officers accused of abuse arbitrary and
 excessively lengthy detentions, corruption and severe inefficiency in the judicial and
 law enforcement systems, deplorable prison conditions, and a lack of respect for the
 rights of indigenous people. Violence against women, abuse of children, and dis-
 crimination against the disabled are problems. The Government did not take effec-
 tive action to punish abusers except in a few highly publicized cases, such as the
 killing of a peasant farmer and torture of 22 others by the military near the
 Cararabo marine outpost and the execution-style killing of a student by the Caracas
 police.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of targeted
 political killings, but extrajudicial killings, primarily of criminal suspects, by the se-
 curity forces continued. The Venezuean Program of Action and Education in
 Human Rights (PROVEA), one of the country's most respected human rights organi-
 zations, documented 126 extrajudicial killings from October 1994 through Septem-
 ber 1995. The killings involved summary executions, indiscriminate or excessive use
 of force, death resulting from torture and mistreatment while in custody, and death
 resulting from abuse during military or public service. According to PROVEA, the
 municipal police carried out 44 of the killings; the state police 29; the PTJ 20; the
 
 
 540
 DISIP 12; the National Guard 9; the armed forces 5; and other branches of the secu-
 rity apparatus or a combination of branches 7.
 The perpetrators of extrajudicial killings act with near impunity, as the Govern-
 ment rarely prosecutes in such cases. The police often fail to investigate crimes al-
 legsly ommitted by their olleagues and characterize incidents of extrajudicial
 ng as "onfrontations," even though eyewitness testimony and evidence strong-
 ly indicate otherwise. In addition, the civilian judicis system remains highly ineffi-
 cient and sometimes orrupt, and miitary ourts are often strongly biased in favor
 of members of the armed forces accused of abuse. A special pretrial summary phase
 called "nud hecho," used in cases involving public officials, often shields members
 of the security forces from prosecution, since cases can languish in that phase for
 several years. In the small number of prosecutions in which the courts convict per-
 petrators of extrajudicial killings and other abuses, the sentences issued are fre-
 quently light, or, more commonly, the convictions are overturned on appeal. Unlike
 common prisoners, members of the security forces charged with crimes rarely spend
 much time in prison.
 In January five members of the Caracas Metroplitan Police were arrested for
 killing three young men in the Los Anaucos neighborhood. In addition, there were
 some other arrests of police officers accused of extrajudicial killings and other abuse.
 In April a member of the Aragua state police was arrested for allegedly shooting
 and killing a protesting student. The officer was released after 1 month, but in June
 six other arrest warrants were issued in connection with the case. In May three
 members of the Metropolitan Police were arrested for the alleged extrajudicial kill-
 ing of Marcos Antonio Vivas Sayago in July 1994. In September four members of
 the PTJ were arrested in connection with the death of 21-year-old student Hector
 Rojas, who was shot twice in the chest while in handcuffs. A police officer was
 charged with the murder of 17-year-old student Joseph Moreno during a demonstra-
 tion m Merida in September. These cases are in a prolonged investigatory phase-
 nearly all other incidents of extrajudicial killings and other abuse went unpunished
 and often uninvestigated.
 There were no prosecutions or new revelations surrounding the discovery of a
 common grave in April 1994 in the Sierra de Perija region of Zulia state. Forensic
 experts provided no count of the number of bodies found in the grave, but human
 rights groups placed the number at around 15. At least one of the bodies showed
 signs of execution-style killing. Although members of a special rural contingent of
 the Zulia state police were alleged to have committed the killings, there were no
 arrests. A number of persons have come forward with credible testimony in recent
 years that there are additional common graves in the Sierra de Perija and
 Catatumbo regions as a result of killings by security forces, although subsequent
 government investigations were inconclusive. Human rights groups reported that
 local farmers and indigenous people are afraid to come forward with additional in-
 formation for fear of reprisals. Likewise, the authorities never prosecuted or held
 anyone responsible for the November 1992 killing of at least 63 prisoners at Catia
 prison. The National Guard-erroneously claiming that coup leaders had distributed
 arms there-stormed the prison, opened cells, and fired on inmates. The majority
 of bodies found were reportedly shot at close range, suggesting summary executions.
 Apart from the officially recorded 63 prisoners killed, the fate of 25 others remains
 unknown-either their bodies were not found or they escaped during or near the
 time of the killings. The Committee of Family Members of the Victims of the Unrest
 (COFAVIC) continued to seek prosecutions and a thorough investigation of the Catia
 prison killings and other incidents of human rights abuse.
 Minimal progress was made towards resolving some 300 alleged extrajudicial
 killings by security forces during and after the civil unrest of February-March 1989.
 There has been only one prosecution: a police officer was found guilty in 1991 of
 killing 18-year-old Eleazor Ramon Mavares, shot by several police officers some 18
 times at close range. The courts released the officer from prison 1 year later. In ne-
 gotiations held with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) in
 March, the Government agreed to initiate a new investigation of the Mavares case,
 punish those responsible, and provide indemnities to the victim's family. COFAVIC
 referred some 40 cases surrounding the 1989 killings to the IACHR, asserting that
 the Government had not ensured justice.
 In September the Inter-American Court of Human Rights agreed to decide the
 case brought against Venezuela for the killing of 14 fishermen in 1988 by military
 and police officers near the border town of El Amparo. The military originally
 claimed that the deaths were the result of action taken against Colombian guerril-
 las, but the Government later acknowledged responsibility and said that it would
 pay indemnities to the survivors and the victims' families. The IACHR, which
 brought the case to the court, is also demanding appropriate sanctions against those
 
 
 541
 who ordered and carried out the attack. In August 1994, a military tribunal over-
 turned the conviction of 16 defendants in the case despite strong evidence that they
 had participated in a planned ambush.
 b. Disappearance.-PROVEA documented six cases of persons who disappeared in
 1995 after reportedly being detained by the security forces. They are Julio Rafael
 Tovar, Fidel Ernesto Croes Aleman, and Luis Martin Sanches Vargas, detained by
 the National Guard; Marco Tulio Briceno Escalona and Juan Daniel Monsalve, de-
 tained by the PTJ; and Jose Ramos, detained by two armed and uniformed officers
 and one civilian of an unknown security force.
 There were no developments in connection with the 1994 disappearances of Elsida
 Ines Alvarez, Benjamin Vasquez, or Fidel A. Sanabria; or the 1993 disappearance
 of Yolanda Landino. All had reportedly been detained by security force members
 prior to their disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture, but credible human rights groups report that security
 forces continue to abuse detainees physically. This abuse most commonly comprises
 beatings during arrest or interrogation, but there have been incidents when the se-
 curity forces used near suffocation and other forms of torture that leave no telltale
 signs. Most victims come from the poorest and least influential parts of society but
 political activists, student leaders, and members of grassroots organizations have
 also been victimized for their activities.
 PROVEA documented 99 cases of torture from October 1994 through September
 1995. Probably a large number of cases were never reported because the victims
 feared retribution. According to PROVEA, the armed forces were responsible for 35
 of the reported torture incidents; the DISIP 24; the PTJ 16; the National Guard 13;
 the state police 8; and the municipal police 3. Almost half of these cases were in
 border areas where constitutional protections were suspended.
 In February after Colombian guerrillas attacked the Cararabo marine outpost,
 members of the military torturea about 23 local rural workers, burying some of
 them to the neck for long periods. The military began an investigation of four of
 its members, but the results of the investigation, if completed, were not made pub-
 lic.
 Torture, like extrajudicial killings, continues because the Government does not
 ensure the independent investigation of complaints needed to bring those respon-
 sible to justice. In addition to lack of vigor by the judiciary, the fact that the Insti-
 tute of Forensic Medicine is part of the PTJ also contributes to a climate of impu-
 nity, since its doctors are unlikely to be impartial in their examinations of cases
 where torture by members of the PTJ may be involved. Very few instances of tor-
 ture have resulted in convictions. According to the Support Network for Justice and
 Peace, a respected human rights organization, the military tortured at least 19
 peasant farmers of the village of La Victoria in Apure state in July, after the mayor
 of the nearby town of Guasdalito had been kidnaped by guerrillas. The alleged vic-
 tims, mostly elderly, said that they had been nearly suffocated with plastic bags,
 forced to sit in excrement, threatened sexually, and beaten. Some were reportedly
 held incommunicado for as long as 12 days. The Defense Minister said that the alle-
 gations were totally false and that one of the alleged victims had links with the
 guerrillas. There was no formal investigation of the incident despite detailed and
 credible evidence pointing to torture.
 In October the Attorney General ordered an investigation of a PTJ unit in Cara-
 cas, which had allegedly beaten four youths with a hockey stick and threatened
 them with "Russian roulette" in order to extract a confession.
 Prison conditions continued to be deplorable due to underfunding, poorly trained
 staff, corruption among prison staff and National Guard members, and overcrowding
 so severe as to constitute inhuman and degrading treatment. As of December 13,
 the 31 prisons administered by the Ministry of Justice held 24,928 inmates, of
 whom the courts had sentenced only 7,269. The prisons operate on average at 190
 percent of designed capacity. Inadequate diet, minimal health care, a prisoner to
 guard ratio as high as 40 to 1, and physical abuse by guards and by other inmates
 ed to many prison riots. Inmates often have to pay guards as well as each other
 to obtain necessities such as space in a cell, a bed, and food. Guns, knives, and ille-
 gal drugs are easily smuggled into most prisons, and violence between prisoners is
 very common.
 In June two inmates in a PTJ jail for minors killed a 17-year-old inmate during
 a protest over not having had any food for a period of 4 days. The PTJ did not pun-
 ish any of its members for gross neglect of their duties. Numerous riots and inci-
 dents of violence resulted in deaths in prisons almost daily. Seven inmates in Catia
 prison were killed and 27 injured when violencebroke-out in -September during a
 police search for weapons. Inmates claimed that they were gunned down without
 
 
 542
 provocation by police and the National Guard. PROVEA registered a total of 116
 prisoners killed and another 288 wounded as a result of violence from October 1994
 through September 1995.
 There were no prosecutions of public officials for the corruption and neglect that
 contributed to the January 1994 riot at Sabaneta prison in Maracaibo. Inmates
 killed 105 fellow prisoners and wounded scores of others. Prison staff and the Na-
 tional Guard were generally unwilling to enter the facility in the months leading
 up to the riot, allowing a state of near anarchy to develop. In addition, during the
 riot, the National Guard allegedly waited for at least 2 hours before entering to re-
 store order. As a result, the number of casualties increased unnecessarily.
 The Government acknowledged the poor state of prisons and implemented some
 plans to improve conditions. Nonetheless, funding for prisons remained extremely
 low, preventing significant improvement in mostpenitentiaries.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-On July 6, the Government reinstated
 the constitutionally protected freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention in all but
 16 municipalities along the Colombian border where guerrilla activity was a con-
 tinuing problem. In the period prior to the Government's reinstatement of the pro-
 tection against arbitrary arrest, the press and human rights groups reported a large
 number of arbitrary detentions during anticrime sweeps in impoverished areas by
 the Metropolitan Police, the DISIP, the National Guard, and the PTJ. The authori-
 ties detained persons during the sweeps for up to 2 days while they checked crimi-
 nal records; most were released without charges. PROVEA documented 13,177 peo-
 ple detained during sweeps from October 1994 through September 1995.
 The law provides for the right to judicial determination of the legality of deten-
 tion; however, the police may hold persons without an arrest warrant or up to 8
 days, and the courts may hold them up to an additional 8 days in court custody.
 In many cases, the police abused detainees physically and psychologically during the
 initial 8-day period-and illegally held them incommunicado. During the second 8-
 day period a jud   may, on the basis of the police investigation, order either the
 formal arrest or the release of the suspect. Arbitrary arrests are common, and au-
 thorities sometimes exceed the time limits for holding suspects. Prison officials often
 illegally demand payment from prisoners for transportatio n to judicial proceedings
 at which formal charges are made. Those who are unable to pay are often forced
 to forego their judicial hearings.
 The 1939 Vagrancy Law permits the detention for up to 5years, without warrant,
 trial, or judicial appeal, of people deemed by the poice obe a danger to society
 even though there is no evidence that they committed a punishable crime. This law
 is used chiefly against people with previous criminal records who are detained dur-
 ing police sweeps. The Interior Miester said in August that the Vagrancy Law was
 "the only legal instrument" the State had in the fight against crime. The Ministry
 of Justice reported there were 106 persons in jail under the Vagrancy Law, hut this
 figure does not reflect the total number arrested under this law and then released.
 Forced exile is illegal and is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-aThe civilian judiciary is legally independent, but
 the major political parties influence the judicial selection process as well as deci-
 sions in particular cases. The judicial sector is made up of the Supreme Court,
 _ which is the court of last appeal; the Attorney General, who provides opinions to
 the courts on prosecution of criminal cases and acts as public ombudsman to bring
 public employee misconduct or violations of constitutional rights of prisoners or ac-
 cused to the attention of the proper authorities; the Ministry of Justce, which man-
 ages the national plice force and prisons and files complaints in criminal courts;
 and the Judicial eouncil, which overseas the lower courts as well as the selection
 and training of judges. The lower court system includes district and municipal
 courts as well as trial and appeal courts which deal with civil and criminal matters.
 The law provides for the right to a fair trial and considers the accused innocent
 until proven gilty in a court. The justice system, however, is overburdened and in-
 efficient, sufers from the corruption of some judges, and lacks public credibility.
 Case backlogs and lengthy pretrial detentions averaging 4  years are the norm.
 Judges are underpaid, poorly disciplined, and susceptible to political influence. The
 law provides for public defenders or those unable to afford an attorney, but there
 are not enough public defenders to handle the caseload. The Judicial Council re-
 ported that there are 159 public defense attorneys with an average of 133 active
 cases each.
 The judicial process is paper intensive, requiring the costly and time-consuming
 production of voluminous reports at every stage by judges, attorneys, and witnesses.
 Military courts can try civilians in cases of armed subversion and whenever
 armed forces members are involved. Military courts are subject to a requirement for
 a speedy trial and a statute of limitations similar to that of civilian courts. Persons
 
 
 543
 convicted by a military court have the same right of appeal to the Supreme Court
 as do those convicted by the civilian system. Military courts, however, are signifi-
 cantly different from civilian courts in that by law the President must review every
 case after the initial investigation stage and decide if that case will go to trial.
 Human ri hts groups assert that this gives the executive excessive power to inter-
 vene in military cases. In addition, the Supreme Court selects military judges from
 a list of candidates provided by the Minister of Defense, a process which links the
 careers of military judges to the high command. The tendency of military judges to
 be responsive to the views of their military leaders, to maintain procedural secrecy,
 and to act slowly in high-profile cases in which the military is implicated make it
 unlikely that defendants will be tried in an impartial or timely manner. As a result,
 military offenders evade punishment for extrajudicial killings and other human
 rights abuses.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Con-
 stitutional provisions prohibit arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, and
 correspondence. However, for 13 months prior to July 6, the Government had sus-
 pended the constitutional guarantee of freedom from search without a warrant. Fur-
 thermore, the suspension remained in effect in some border areas. Even after rein-
 statement of the provision, security forces often conducted searches of homes with-
 out warrants, especially during anticrime sweeps in impoverished areas. In recent
 years, there have been some complaints of telephone surveillance, and human rights
 monitors accused the security forces of illegal telephone monitoring.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and these liberties, along with academic freedom, were generally re-
 spected. The press criticizes the Government and denounces government- inter-
 ference in the media.
 In 1994 the Congress passed and the President signed a law which forbi'ds per-
 sons without journalism degrees to practice and requires journalists to be members
 of the National College of Journalists (CNP). Media owners, the Catholic Church,
 and certain press groups continued to criticize this law as a violation of the freedom
 of expression guaranteed by the Constitution and international agreements on
 human rights.
 The newspaper photographer whose widely published photo of Hector Rojas in po-
 lice custody just before he was killed (see Section L.a.) led to the arrest of five police-
 men received several telephone death threats. The newspaper, El Nacional, took the
 photographer off the crime beat to limit his vulnerability to police retribution. There
 were no prsecutions for the killing of two reporrs, Maria Veronica Tessari and
 Virgilio Fernandez, by members of the security forces while they respectively cov-
 ered a 1992 student demonstration and a 1992 coup attempt.
 When two newspapers, El Nacional and El Diario de Caracas, published a wire
 service story in June about an alleged coup plot by the Prsidents sn-in-law, direc-
 tors and editors of both newspapers were called in for questioning by the military
 intelligence directorate.
 The Government is a significant source of advertising revenue for the media, and
 there have been instances where government advertising was apparently channeled
 for political ends. When the newspaper El Nacional publishedaicles on alleged
 corruption by high government officials, the Finance Ministry withheld its public
 announcements i that newspaper for a period of 2 months. Some media owners
 abuse the right to a free press in their pursuit of personal political or financial ad-
 vantage.
 b.Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government normally re-
 an ct the constitutional provision for freedom of peaceful assembly and association.
 Prfessional and academic associations operate without interferene, and public
 meetings, including those of all political parties, are generally held unimpeded. The
 Government requires permits for public marches but does not deny them for politi-
 cal reasons. As a result of violence that occurred at the Central University of Ven-
 ezuela campus the day before a planned protest march in September, the Govern-
 ment ordered the march to be postponed. It was held 2 weeks later.
 As in earlier years, many demonstrations turned violent and were quelled by se-
 cuity forces. Hooded youths known as "encapuchados" frequently fomented the vio-
 lence. A  student's death  during a demonstration in Merida     in September
 precipitated several days of violence, and the local governor called in the militar
 to regain control of the streets (see Section l.a.). There were also a number of inci-
 dents when security forces contained or stopped peaceful protests. According to
 
 
 PROVEA, 4 people were killed during demonstrations, 82 injured, and 521 detained
 from October 1994 through September 1995.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, pro-
 vided that a faith does not threaten public oider or violate good custom. The au-
 thorities respect this right in practice; all religious groups enjoy freedom of worship.
 While foreign missionaries proselytize actively throughout the country, they often
 have to wait many months for the processing of their religious worker visas. For
 missionaries already in the country, renewal of visas also can take months. During
 the period of irregular visa status, missionaries experience harassment by authori-
 ties, especially at military checkpoints.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens and legal residents are free to travel within the country and
 to go abroad and return. Although the freedom to travel was suspended from June
 1994 to July 1995, there were no reports of the Government actually restricting a
 person's travel in 1995. Exchange controls limited the ability of individuals to obtain
 foreign currency for travel abroad.
 Venezuela traditionally has been a haven for refugees, exiles, and displaced per-
 sons from many European, Caribbean, and Latin American countries. They are
 given normal residence status and may be expelled only because of criminal activi-
 ties.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right peacefully to change their gov-
 ernment, and citizens exercise this right through periodic, free and fair elections
 held on the basis of universal suffrage. In state and local elections held on Decem-
 ber 3, however, an antiquated and inefficient system for counting votes gave rise
 to numerous and, in some cases, credible allegations that the political parties that
 dominated state electoral councils had committed fraud.
 Women and nonwhites participate fully in Government and politics but remain
 underrepresented in senior leadership positions. There are 12 female deputies in the
 lower house of Congress (out of a total of 203), 3 female Senators (out of 53), and
 1 female governor (out of 23). Indigenous people have traditionally not been fully
 integrated into the political system due to their lack of knowledge of how it works,
 low voter turnout, and residency in areas far from the capital and other cities. Few
 indigenous people are in the Government, and only one is a deputy in Congress.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction,
 investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government offi-
 cials, though often disagreeing with their findings, are generally cooperative.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination based on ethnic origin, gender, or disability. The
 Government, however, does not sufficiently enforce laws which safeguard the rights
 of indigenous people, protect women against societal and domestic violence, and en-
 sure disabled people's access to jobs and public services. Very few resources are de-
 voted to children's welfare; young delinquents are locked in institutions that are un-
 safe and dangerous.
 oe-omen face substantial institutional and societal prejudice with respect
 to rape and domestic violence. The law makes rape extremely difficult to provere-
 quiring at a minimum medical examination within 48 hours of the violation. Few
 police officers are trained to deal responsibly with rape victims. The PTJ received
 2,599 reports of rape in the entire country during the period from January to Sep-
 tember 1995 compared to 1994 which had a total of 3,537 for the entire year. Wom-
 en's organizations, however, assert that this figure is very low and does not portray
 an accurate picture of the problem of rape. The overwhelming majority of rape vic-
 tim do not report the incident or press charges due to societal pressure and their
 own feelings of guilt.
 Domestic violence against women is very common and has been aggravated by the
 count ry's economic difficulties. According to local monitors, the police are generally
 unwilling to intervene to prevent domestic violence, and the courts rarely prosecute
 those accused of such abuse. In addition, poor women are generally unaware of legal
 remedies and have little access to them.
 The Congress reformed the Civil Code in the 1980's to make women and men le-
 gally equal in marriage. Women comprise roughiy half the student body of most uni-
 versities, have advanced in many professions, including medicine and law, and have
 
 
 545
 
 gradually torn down many of the barriers to their full participation in political and
 economic life. Nonetheless, women are still underrepresented in the higher ranks
 of labor unions and private industry.
 The Labor Code specifies that employers must not discriminate against women
 with regard to pay or working conditions, must not fire them duringpregnancy and
 for a year after giving birth, must grant them unpaid leave and benefits or 6 weeks
 before the birth of a child and 12 weeks after, and must provide them 10 weeks
 of unpaid leave if they legally adopt children under 3 years of age. According to the
 Ministry of Labor and the major labor federation, these regulations are enforced in
 the formal sector, although social security payments are often delayed.
 Children.-Many children face hardship. According to a study by two reputable
 nongovernmental organizations, one in four children is malnourished. The Govern-
 ment scaled back its expenditure on education, health, and social services, leaving
 many impoverished children with no government assistance. While the law provides
 for universal free education, the Government dedicates very little funding to pri-
 mary and secondary education. Many government agencies responsible for the wel-
 fare of children are plagued by corruption and government funding often does not
 reach the children it is intended to help. In addition, many reform institutions for
 young delinquents are in deplorable condition.
 According to children's rights groups, the recent increase in poverty has raised the
 level of stress within families and led to a rise in the number of abandoned children
 and to more child abuse. However, neighbors often hesitate to report cases of child
 abuse, due to a fear of entanglement with the authorities and ingrained attitudes
 regarding family privacy. The overburdened judicial system, though very slow, gen-
 erally ensures that in most situations children are removed from abusive households
 once a case has been reported. Public facilities for such children, however, are inad-
 equate and have poorly trained staff.
 People With Disabilities.-The physically disabled have minimal access to public
 transportation, and ramps are practically nonexistent, even in government build-
 ings. According to local advocates, the disabled are discriminated against in many
 sectors, including education, health care, and employment.
 In 1993 the Government passed the first comprehensive law to protect the rights
 of the disabled. The new law requires that all newly constructed or renovated public
 parks and buildings provide access for the disabled. Among other important provi-
 sions the law forbids discrimination in employment practices and in the provision
 of public services. However, the Government did not make a significant effort to im-
 plement the new law, to inform the public of it, or to try to change societal prejudice
 against the disabled.
 Indigenous People.-Although the law prohibits discrimination based on ethnic or-
 i[in, members of the country's indigenous population frequently suffer from inatten-
 tIn to and violation of their human rights. There are about 315,000 indigenous peo-
 ple comprising 25 ethnic groups, according to a special 1992 census.
 The Constitution provides for special laws governing "the protection of indigenous
 communities and their progressive incorporation into the life of the nation." None-
 theless, indigenous people are not able to protect their civil and political rights or
 to influence decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, and the allocation
 of natural resources. In February representatives of the 19 indigenous groups of
 Amazonas state brought a case to the Supreme Court challenging the constitutional-
 ity of the law which defines political boundaries and commonly held land within
 their state. They claim that the law, promulgated in 1994, jeopardizes their collec-
 tive possession of ancestral lands.
 Many of the country's indigenous people live isolated from modern civilization and
 lack access to basic health and educational facilities available to other citizens. High
 rates of cholera, hepatitis-B, malaria, and other diseases plague their communities.
 Major epidemics of equine encephalitis and dengue fever in August and September
 were particularly serious among the Wayuu indigenous group of Zulia state. Tour-
 ists and other outsiders inadvertently introduce new viruses to Indian populations
 with unprepared immune systems: the common cold often becomes bronchitis, and
 chicken pox can be fatal. In addition, few indigenous communities hold title to their
 lands, and many have been displaced in recent years by government-sponsored
 projects. Fertilizer and machinery have polluted rivers, while strip mining and
 large-scale farming have destroyed habitats.
 The Yanomami, among the most isolated of the indigenous people, have been sub-
 ject to persistent incursions into their territory by illegal Brazilian gold miners. The
 miners have not only brought diseases but social ills as well. In August 1993, min-
 ers killed at least 16 Yanomami in a remote area of Amazonas state. An indigenous
 people's group reported two similar killings in 1994. The Government began to bomb
 illegal airstrips used by the miners and to use force to try to prevent the miners'
 
 
 entry through the porous border. Indigenous people's groups, however, strongly criti-
 cized the Government for not forceflly seeking the prosecution of the perpetrators
 of the 1993 massacre who had retreated into Brazilian ternitory.
 In February 1994, members of the army shot and killed three members of the
 Yucpa ethnic gup after women in the group tried to block the soldiers from taking
 wood they had cut. The military allegedly responded by firing indiscriminately. To
 protest the killings a large group of Yucpas temporarily took over several ranches
 and blocked roads. here were no arrests of those responsible for the killings.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Both the Constitution and labor law recognize and
 encourage the right of unions to organize. The comprehensive 1990 Labor Code ex-
 tends to all private sector and public sector employees (except members of the
 armed forces) the right to form and join unions of their choosing. The Code man-
 dates registration of unions with the Ministry of Labor, but it reduces the Ministry's
 discretion by specifying that registration may not be denied if the proper documents
 (a record of the founding meeting, the statutes, and the memborship list) are sub-
 mitted. Only a judge may dissolve a union, and then only for reasons listed in the
 law, such as the dissolution of a firm or by agreement of two-thirds of the member-
 ship.
 One major union confederation, the Venezuelan Confederation of Workers (CTV),
 and three small ones as well as a number of independent unions, operate freely.
 About 25 percent of the national labor force is unionized. There are no restrictions
 on affiliation with international labor organizations, and many union organizations
 are active internationally. The CTV's topleadership includes members of several po-
 litical parties. The majority are affiliated with the country's largest party, Demo-
 cratic Action (AD). The CTV and the AD exercise reciprocal influence on each other.
 The law recognizes the right of public and private sector employees to strike.
 However, public servants may only exercise it if it does not cause "irremediable
 damage to the population or to institutions." The Labor Code allows the President
 to order public or private sector strikers back to work and to submit their dispute
 to arbitration if the strike "puts in immediate danger the lives or security of all or
 part of the population." During 1995 most strikes occurred among government em-
 ployees. With the xeption ofa slow-down by nir traffic controllers and strikes by
 judicial workers and university professors, the threat to strike was sufficient in
 most cases to achieve a resolution satisfactory to the workers.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code protects and
 encourages collective bargaining, which is freely practiced. According to the Code,
 employers "must negotiate" a collective contract with the union that represents the
 majorty of their workers. The Code also contains a provision stating that wages
 may 6e raised by administrative decree, provided that the Congress approves the
 decree.
 The law prohibits employers from interfering with the formation of unions or with
 their activities and from stipulating as a condition of employment that new workers
 must abstain from union activity or must join a specified union. Ministry of Labor
 inspectors hear complaints regarding violations of these regulations, and can impose
 a maximum fine of twice the minimum monthly wage for a first infraction. Under
 the Code, union officials enjoy special protection from dismissal. If a judge deter-
 mines that any worker was fired for union activity, the worker is entitled to back
 pay plus either reinstatement or payment of a substantial sum of money, which var-
 ies according to his years of seniority.
 Labor law and practice is the same in the sole export processing zone as in the
 rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There is no forced or compulsory
 labor. The Labor Code states that no one may "obligate others to work against their
 will."
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code allows children
 between the ages of 12 to 14 years to work only if the National Institute for Minors
 or the Labor Ministry grant special permission. It states that children between the
 ages of 14 and 16 years may not work without permission from their legal guard-
 ians. Minors may not work in mines or smelters, in occupations "that risk life or
 health" or could damage intellectual or moral development, or in "public spectacles."
 Those under 16 years of age must by law work no more than 6 hours a day or
 30 hours a week. Minors under the age of 18 years may work only during the hours
 between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. The Ministry of Labor and the National Institute for Mi-
 nors enforce the law effectively in the formal sector of the economy but much less
 so in the informal sector, which accounts for 55 percent of total employment. Accord-
 ing to a 1993 study, some 1 million children work in the informal sector, mostly as
 
 
 street vendors; there is no other occupation which comprises large numbers of chil-
 dren.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Venezuela has a national urban minimum
 wage and a national rural minimum wage. The monthly minimum wage was $52
 (15 000 bolivars) for urban workers and $43 (12,500 bolivars) for rural workers. In
 addition, most minimum-wage workers received mandatory bonuses amounting to
 $59 (17,000 bolivars). Fringe benefits are added to these minimum figures; they
 vary with the workers' individual circumstances, but in general increase wages by
 about one-third. In the past, this combined income provided a living wage. However,
 unions now argue that purchasing power has declined enough over the last several
 years to warrant a doubling of the minimum wage. The law excludes only domestic
 workers and concierges from coverage under the minimum wage decrees. Under the
 Labor Code, the rates are set by administrative decree, which Congress may either
 suspend or ratify but may not change. The Ministry of Labor enforces minimum
 wage guarantees effectively in the formal sector of the economy but generally does
 not enforce them in the informal sector.
 The 1990 Labor Code reduced the standard workweek to a maximum of 44 hours,
 and requires "two complete days of rest each week." Some unions, such as the petro-
 leum workers, have negotiated a 40-hour week. Overtime may not exceed 2 hours
 daily, 10 hours weekly, or 100 hours annually, and may not be paid at a rate less
 than time and a half. The Ministry of Labor effectively enforces these standards in
 the formal sector.
 The 1986 Health and Safety Law is still awaiting implementation regulations and -
 is not enforced. The delay is due largely to concern that the law provides penal sanc-
 tions against management when violations of health and safety occur and to ambi-
 guity in the law over what constitutes a violation. The Labor Code states that em-
 ployers are obligated to pay specified amounts (up to a maximum of 25 times the
 minimum monthly salary) to workers for accidents or occupational illnesses, regard-
 less of who is responsible for the injury.
 It also requires that workplaces must maintain "sufficient protection for health
 and life against sicknesses and accidents," and it imposes fimes of from one-quarter
 to twice the minimum monthly salary for first infractions. Inspectors from the Min-
 istry of Labor appear to enforce the law effectively. Workers can remove themselves
 from dangerous workplace situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
