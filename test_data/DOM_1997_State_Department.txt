 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 The Constitution provides for a popularly elected president and a bicameral con-
 gress. President Leonel Fernandez o the  ominican Liberation Party took office in
 August 1996 after a free and fair election. The Social Christian Reformist and Do-
 minican Revolutionary parties dominate the two legislative chambers. The Govern-
 ment continued an overhaul of the nominally independent judiciary, which had been
 highly politicized, by overseeing the selection of a new 16-member Supreme Court
 through a transparent and highly participatory process.
 The National Police (PN), the National Department of Investigations (DNI), the
 National Drug Control Directorate (DNCD), and the military (army, air force, and
 navy) form the security forces. The PN is under the Secretary of the Interior and
 Police; the military is under the Secretary of the Armed Forces; and the DNI and
 the DNCD, which have personnel from both the police and the military, report di-
 rectly to the President. The security forces are generally responsive to civilian exec-
 utive branch authority. However, some members of the security forces continued to
 commit human rights abuses, sometimes with the tacit acquiescence of the civil au-
 thorities.
 The economy, once heavily dependent on sugar and other agricultural exports, has
 diversified; tourism and free trade zones (FTZ's) are now major sources of income
 and employment. Remittances from abroad provide an estimated 10 percent of the
 $1,600 per capita gross domestic product. State-owned firms such as the State Sugar
 Council, the Corporation for State Enterprises, and the Dominican Electricity Cor-
 poration have impeded economic growth because of inept financial and administra-
 tive practices.
 The Government's human rights record improved slightly, although serious
 abuses remain. Principal human rights problems include continuing instances of
 extrajudicial killings by police, beatings and arbitrary detention of suspects, deten-
 tion of suspects' relatives, the security services' refusal to obey judicial orders, and
 poor prison conditions. Most reports of human rights abuses involved the police and
 the DNCD, rather than the military. Human rights training for new police officers
 became more extensive, and 2,000 military personnel transferred to the National
 Police in September underwent several weeks of human rights courses. Other seri-
 ous problems include interference with the judiciary, lengthy pretrial detention, ju-
 dicial corruption, maladministration of the courts, discrimination and violence
 against women, prostitution, abuse of children, discrimination against the disabled,
 abuse of Haitian migrants and their descendants, compulsory and child labor, and
 impediments to free association. Workers in the state-owned sugar plantations and
 mills continued to work under unfair and unsafe conditions.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings, but there were reports of about 50 extrajudicial killings by the DNCD and
 the police. Human rights observers agree that such abuses occurred less frequently
 
 
 498
 
 than in 1996, but that serious problems remain. In January the police beat a man
 to death while he was painting his house near a political demonstration in the cap-
 ital; the police took the corpse to the hospital and state physicians removed the cor-
 neas from its eyes without legal consent. In February in Santo Domingo, police fa-
 tally shot a Haitian woodworker in his workshop after he declined to pay a weekly
 bribe demanded by the officers. When the police came to remove squatters from a
 plot.of land in Herrera, Santo Domingo, in April, they slapped, kicked, and beat one
 squatter while forcing him to pick up trash, with many witnesses and reporters
 present. He later died of the beatings. In May the press and human rights groups
 reported that DNCD officers in Nagua shot to death a suspect while trying to ex-
 tract testimony from him about alleged drug offenses. Although the Government es-
 tablished a procedure for trying and dismissing officials who commit extrajudicial
 killings, the authorities were not able to provide an accounting of disciplinary ac-
 tions taken against DNCD and police officers during the year.
 About 10 civilians and police officers were killed in clashes in October and Novem-
 ber. Some of the civilian eaths were caused by other protesters, but the police were
 responsible for most of them. During the November 11-12 general strike, the police,
 reinforced by the military, demonstrated considerable restraint and killed no one
 while detaining persons suspected of vandalism and violence.
 The authorities made some progress in an investigation of the 1975 murder of
 journalist Orlando Martinez. Prosecutors indicted five individuals-including three
 former generals-who await trial.
 Military courts try military personnel charged with extrajudicial killings. Police
 tribunals have on occasion tried, convicted, and sentenced personnel charged with
 extrajudicial killings. Police officers may be tried by police courts or remanded to
 civilian court jurisdiction. From January through November, police courts tried 6 po-
 lice officers for murder and 216 for felonies, while the authorities dismissed 560
 other police officers and remanded their cases to the civilian court system.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 The Fernandez Government made little progress in the reopened case of Narciso
 Gonzalez, a university professor and critic of the Government who disappeared in
 May 1994. The Santo Domingo district attorney's office filed the case with a civilian
 court system investigative judge who followed up several leads-including one pro-
 vided by a convict who claimedin August that he had participated in the disappear-
 ance-and questioned several military officers. However, the Government was unre-
 sponsive to the judge's efforts to extract information from the military hierarchy and
 officials of the former government. The Inter-American Commission on Human
 Rights (IACHR) has the case under consideration. At the IACHR's request, the Gov-
 ernment and the nongovernmental Truth Commission each named three persons to
 a new commission tasked with providing guidance to the investigative judge and re-
 porting back to the IACHR in February 1998. The new commission had met twice
 by the end of the year.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and other forms of physical abuse are illegal, but instances of security serv-
 ice personnel physically abusing detainees continued. Lack of supervision, training,
 and accountability throughout the law enforcement and corrections systems exacer-
 bate the problem of physical abuse. Human rights groups and the press reported
 numerous incidents of physical abuse of detainees while in custody. Examples of
 such incidents included the brutalizing of an inmate and his wife at Najayo prison
 while the police tried to learn of an alleged plan to help another prisoner escape,
 and the 8-day detention and torture of a truck driver, never formally accused of a
 crime, by police in Santo Domingo. There were multiple press reports and allega-
 tions from several human rights groups that the DNCD leadership was present dur-
 ing the torture of prisoners. Although the authorities were not able to furnish evi-
 dence that the perpetrators of these abuses had been punished, President
 Fernandez dismissed the DNCD director in September. Following his departure,
 there were no further reports of DNCD torture.
 DNCD and some mid- and lower-level police authorities resisted efforts of civilian
 authorities to provide adequate supervision of the investigation process as required
 by law. The prosecutor's office placed lawyers in 12 high-volume police stations and
 several DNCD offices to monitor the investigative process. In September, however,
 the prosecutor's office in Santo Domingo withdrew five of these lawyers from the
 DNCD. The chief prosecutor claimed that DNCD officials had not permitted these
 lawyers to observe criminal interrogations. After the removal of the DNCD director,
 the Government immediately returned prosecutors to DNCD offices. The DNCD
 added new human rights training courses for its officers in September.
 Civilian prosecutors sometimes file felony charges against police and military offi-
 cials related to physical abuse, torture, and related crimes. Although punishment
 
 
 may range up to 5 years' incarceration for serious cases of abuse, as a rule judges
 have sentenced convicted officials to sentences ranging from a 1-month suspension
 to 6 months' incarceration.
 Prison conditions are poor. The prisons are grossly overcrowded, and health and
 sanitary conditions are poor. Conditions at La Victoria prison pose a serious threat
 to life and health; as many as 3,500 inmates were held there at one point during
 the year, although it was originally designed for 800. By year's end, the Government
 had reduced La Victoria's population to 2,100. Najayo prison was built for 700, yet
 contained 2,400 prisoners for most of the year. Medical care suffers from a lack of
 supplies and available physicians. Prisoners immobilized by and dying of AIDS are
 not transferred to a hospital.
 The Government has begun a prison renovation program and in April opened the
 "Alaska" wing at La Victoria prison with improved sanitation and more comfortable
 facilities. It also renovated large portions of the San Pedro de Macoris and San
 Francisco de Marcoris prisons. The Government began to deploy a new prison police
 force in September, which, through an integration of soldiers, lawyers, social work-
 ers, and psychologists, offered increased opportunities for rehabilitation. It also
 opened the first prison school at Najayo prison in September, where 200 prisoners
 signed up for classes in 7 subjects.
 Females are separated from male inmates. In general, conditions in the female
 prison wings are superior to those found in male prison wings, and there have been
 fw reports of serious abuse by guards.
 The Government made some progress separating juvenile from adult offenders,
 and removed all minors from La Victoria. In August 10 juvenile prisoners success-
 fully protested a transfer to the Monte Plata facility, where many violent offenders
 are housed and several prison riots occurred during the year. In other prisons, the
 authorities still hold juveniles with adult inmates.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution stipulates that the au-
 thorities may detain suspects for a maximum of 48 hours before arraignment, after
 which they must charge or release them. However, in special circumstances, sus-
 pects may be detained for longer periods with the approval of the prosecutor's office.
 The security forces continued to violate constitutional provisions by detaining sus-
 pects for investigation or interrogation beyond the prescribed 48-hour limit. The se-
 curity forces traditionally detain all suspects and witnesses in a crime and use the
 investigative process to determine which ones are innocent and merit release and
 which ones they should continue to hold. After the prosecutor's office placed its law-
 yers in several police stations, the police curtailed the practice of arbitrary detention
 in those precincts.
 The DNCD and National Police continued to engage in indiscriminate roundups
 of people in poorer neighborhoods. The security forces also continued to detain rel-
 atives and friends of suspected criminals with the aim of forcing the surrender of
 suspects. The prosecutor's office challenged the DNCD and the National Police to
 curb these abuses, but human rights groups contend that minimal progress was
 achieved.
 On October 26, Police Chief Sanz Jiminian announced that the Special Operations
 Unit had taken more than 500 persons from neighborhoods around Santo Domingo
 into custody. The Government stated that it detained these persons because it be-
 lieved that they might incite violence at the general strike planned for November
 11-12. The Government did not charge these detainees with specific crimes and held
 them until after the strike.
 Many suspects suffer long pretrial detention; during the year, the Government re-
 ducing the proportion of the prison population awaiting trial from 88 to around 70
 percent. Pretrial detention averages 29 months in the instructional phase and an-
 other 9 months in the trial phase.
 Due to the inefficiency of the courts (see Section 1.e.), the granting of bail has
 become the de facto criminal justice system. As a rule, defendants awarded bail
 rarely face an actual trial; those denied bail may serve their entire sentences while
 awaiting trial. The Dominican Association of Lawyers estimated in August that 60
 percent of untried inmates had already served more time in prison than they would
 have if tried and convicted. Even after being acquitted of crimes, persons sometimes
 remain incarcerated for several months.
 In January the Government passed a law pardoning the fines of insolvent pris-
 oners. Many prisoners were released who hadserved more time in prison than re-
 quired, but lacked the funds to pay the monetary portion of their sentence. On De-
 cember 22, President Fernandez pardoned by decree 70 more prisoners. According
 to government statistics, another 600 prisoners could be immediately released if a
 
 
 500
 decree were issued pardoning inmates who had not been tried but had already
 served the maximum possible sentence for the accused crime.
 The law prohibits forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Although the Constitution stipulates an independ-
 ent judiciary, interference from other public and private entities, including the exec-
 utive branch, has substantially undermined judicial independence. In August for the
 first time, the National Council of the Judiciary chose members of the Supreme
 Court, underscoring a new independence from the executive and legislative
 branches.
 The judiciary, based primarily on the French judicial system, includes a 16-mem-
 ber Supreme Court, appeals courts, courts of first instance, and justice of the peace
 courts. There are also specialized courts that handle administrative, labor, traffic,
 and land registration matters.
 The new Supreme Court began to combat judicial corruption by organizing an in-
 spections and investigations unit. After the new court was installed in August, it
 also dismissed 27 judges for corruption or ineptitude.
 Judges, rather than juries, render all verdicts and are appointed by the National
 Council of Magistrates. Under the 1994 constitutional amendments, the Supreme
 Court is responsible for naming all lower-court judges in accordance with a judicial
 career law, which was still pending in Congress at year's end.
 The Constitution provides for public trial. However, during the closed pretrial in-
 structional or investigative phase of the criminal justice process, the State tradition-
 ally provided no counsel to imprisoned indigents. President Fernandez approved
 funding for a new public defender program, which is expected to be implemented
 in 1998. Through 1997, the State contracted private practice lawyers to perform
 public defender services in felony cases. The courts rarely appoint defense lawyers
 in misdemeanor cases.
 The judicial system is plagued by chronic delays, and many suspects suffer
 lengthy pretrial detention (see Section 1.d.). In September the Government began
 a 5-year program to modernize courts in Santo Domingo, but the program has not
 yet made an impact on the judicial backlog.
 Military or police courts have jurisdiction over members of the security forces.
 With increasing frequency, however, military or police bards remanded cases in-
 volving capital crimes (murder, rape, etc.) to civilian courts for review after dishon-
 orably discharging the perpetrators.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution contains provisions against invasion of the home. Although the Govern-
 ment does not arbitrarily use wiretapping or other surreptitious methods to inter-
 fere with the private lives of persons or families, it tolerates an active private wire-
 tapping industry. The authorities may only search a residence in the presence of a
 prosecutor or an assistant prosecutor, in cases of "hot pursuit," or where there is
 reason to believe that a crime is in progress.
 The security forces continued to detain relatives and friends of suspects to try to
 compel suspects to surrender (see Section 1.d.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for these freedoms, and the
 Government respects them in practice.
 Citizens of all political persuasions exercise freedom of speech. Newspapers and
 magazines freely present a diversity of opinion and criticism. Self-censorship is prac-
 ticed, particularly when coverage could adversely affect the economic or political in-
 terests of media owners.
 The numerous privately owned radio and television stations broadcast all political
 points of view. A 1971 law prohibits foreign-language broadcasts. The Government
 controls one television station but no major newspapers.
 Public and private universities enjoy broad academic freedom. The main public
 university, the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo, with approximately
 35,000 students, has no restrictions on enrollment and maintains a policy of non-
 intervention (other than curriculum development) in classroom affairs. The Govern-
 ment exerts no control over private universities, except for the preservation of
 standards, and teachers are free to espouse their own theories without government
 oversight.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, which the Government commonly respects in practice. Outdoor
 public marches and meetings require permits, which the Government usually
 grants. There were a number of clashes between police and protesters in October
 and November in Santo Domingo and other towns such as Barahona, Bani, and
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 Bonao (see Section L.a.). These protests were largely prompted by electricity short-
 ages and rising prices.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, which the Government gen-
 erally respects in practice. Political parties freely affiliate with their foreign counter-
 part organizations. Professional organizations of lawyers, doctors, teachers, and oth-
 ers function freely and can maintain relations with counterpart international bodies
 of diverse political philosophies.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution prohibits discrimination on religious
 grounds, and the Government does not interfere with the practice of religion.
 The Catholic Church, which signed a concordat with the Government in 1954, en-
 joys special privileges not extended to other religions. These include the use of pub-
 lic funds to underwrite some church expenses, such as rehabilitation of church facili-
 ties.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens face no unusual legal restrictions on travel within or outside
 the country.
 Haitians continue to come in great numbers to the Dominican Republic, some le-
 gally but most undocumented, in search of economic opportunity. Throughout the
 year, the security forces, particularly the army, deported undocumented Haitian na-
 tionals believed to be in the country illegally. In January and February, inter-
 national observers estimated that the Government deported between 15,000 and
 25,000 Haitians. Deportations continued on a daily basis through the rest of the
 year, but in more modest numbers. In many cases, the Government denied those
 deported the opportunity to demonstrate that they legally resided in the Dominican
 Republic. Haitian Government officials complained that Haitians were often de-
 tained up to 3 days and held with little or no food and then deported without notice
 to Haitian authorities.
 Representatives of nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) working in rural areas
 reported that decisions to deport were often made by lower ranking members of the
 security forces, sometimes based upon the racial characteristics of the deportees.
 Haitian sugar cane workers face restrictions on their freedom of movement (see Sec-
 tion 6.c.).
 According to a 1984 law, an applicant for refugee status must be referred to the
 National Committee for Refugees by the National Office of Refugee Affairs, which
 has not been established. Instead, the Department of Immigration issues docu-
 mentation to refugees certified as such by the United Nations High Commissioner
 for Refugees (-tNHCR). While these documents are accepted by the police and irmi-
 gration officials, the process by which they are issued does not comply with the law.
 There were 637 such refugees living in the country in September.
 The Government cooperates with the UNHCR and other humanitarian organiza-
 tions in assisting refugees. The Government provides first asylum and resettlement.
 One person was granted asylum in 1997. On October 31, the Government returned
 two Cuban refugees to Cuba, according to the UNHCR. The two refugees were part
 of a group of 23 Cubans returned after the Government obtained assurances from
 the Cuban Government that they would not be treated unfairly.
 There were no other reports of the forced return of persons to a country where
 they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Dominican Republic is a constitutional democracy, and its citizens last exer-
 cised this right in general elections in 1996. The President and all 150 members of
 the Senate and Chamber of Deputies are freely elected every 4 years by secret bal-
 lot. There is universal adult suffrage, except that active duty police and military
 personnel may not vote. The President appoints the governors of the 29 provinces.
 Opposition groups of the left, right, and center operate openly. The Government
 began planning for congressional and municipal elections in 1998, the first time
 since 1968 that such elections would not coincide with a presidential election.
 The nation has a functioning multiparty system. In practice the President can
 dominate public policy formulation and implementation. He can exercise his author-
 ity through the use of the veto, discretion to act by decree, and influence as the
 leader ofhis party. Traditionally, the President has predominant power in the Gov-
 enent, effectively making many important decisions by decree. However, Presi-
 dent Fernandez encouragedthe legislature to play a greater role, and has reduced
 reliance on rule by decree.
 Congress provides an open forum for the free exchange of views and debate. The
 two main opposition parties and their allies combined hold 88 and 96 percent of the
 
 
 502
 lower and upper houses, respectively, leaving President Fernandez's party with a
 limited congressional presence.
 Women and minorities confront no serious legal impediments to political partici-
 pation, but they are underrepresented. Women hold 14 seats in the 120-member
 House of Deputies and 1 seat in the 30-member Senate. Women continue to have
 representation in appointed positions, albeit to a limited degree. Two of the 15 cabi-
 net secretaries are women, and women hold 3 of 29 provincial governorships. Five
 of 16 justices chosen for the new Supreme Court are women, the first females ever
 to serve on the high court.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Nongovernmental human rights organizations operate freely without govern-
 mental interference. In addition to the Dominican Human Rights Committee and
 the nongovernmental Truth Commission dealing with the Narciso case, several
 other Haitian, church, and labor groups exist. There is no ombudsman's office.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination based on race and sex. Such discrimination ex-
 ists in society, but the Government has seldom acknowledged its existence or made
 efforts to combat it.
 Women.-Domestic violence and sexual harassment are widespread. The law ex-
 onerates a rapist if the rape victim does not file charges. A rape victim cannot file
 charges against her husband unless the marriage is annulled. In January President
 Fernandez signed a law which, for the first time, protects women against domestic
 and workplace abuse. The Government undertook a public information campaign,
 informing the population of the law through television advertising, distribution of
 flyers, and orientation in schools. The courts jailed several men for violation of this
 law, and in a highly publicized case, a judge was indicted for the sexual abuse of
 one of his employees.
 The Government does not vigorously enforce prostitution laws. Sex tourism is a
 growing industry throughout the country as international visitors continue to in-
 crease. NGO's have ongoing HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted disease prevention
 programs for male and female prostitutes, as well as hotel and industrial zone work-
 ers. Dominican women are also victims of rings trafficking in women and girls to
 Europe to work as prostitutes in conditions rife with exploitation and mistreatment.
 One NGO counsels women planning to accept job offers in Europe and the eastern
 Caribbean about immigration, health, and other issues. The program also provides
 services to returning women. The new law against domestic violence prohibits acting
 as an intermediary in a transaction of prostitution, but the Government has not
 used the law to prosecute third parties who derive profit from prostitution.
 Divorce is easily obtainable by either spouse, and women can hold property in
 their own names apart from their husbands. Traditionally, women have not shared
 equal social and economic status or opportunity with men, and men hold the over-
 whelming majority of leadership positions in all sectors. In many instances women
 are paid less than men in jobs of equal content and equal skill level. Some employ-
 ers in industry reportedly give pregnancy tests to women before hiring them, as part
 of a medical examination. Some employers have stated, and workers confirm, that
 pregnant women are not hired.
 Children.-Despite the existence of government institutions dedicated to child
 welfare, private social and religious organizations carry the principal burden. The
 private institutions receive no government financing. The 1994 Minor's Code re-
 quires only 6 years of formal education.
 The most serious abuse involving children is the failure of the judicial system to
 protect the status of minors in criminal cases. The authorities sometimes treated
 minors as adults and incarcerated them in prison rather than juvenile detention
 centers. Although the Minor's Code became law in 1994, the Government did not
 begin to implement it until 1997 by laying the groundwork for the juvenile court
 system mandated by the code. Legal defenders for juveniles began work in two
 cities, Santo Domingo and La Vega.
 The Minor's Code contains provisions against child abuse, including physical and
 emotional mistreatment, sexual exploitation, and child labor. It also provides for re-
 moval of a mistreated or delinquent child to a protective environment. However, ac-
 cording to local monitors, instances of child abuse were underreported because of
 traditional beliefs that family problems should be dealt with inside the family. Some
 in the tourist industry have provided or facilitated sexual exploitation of children.
 Tours are marketed overseas with the understanding that boys and girls can be
 
 
 503
 found as sex partners. There are no shelters providing refuge to children who break
 free from the prostitution trade. In October the Government began to arrest, jail,
 and deport foreigners involved in child prostitution in the town of Boca Chica.
 People With Disabilities.-Disabled persons encounter discrimination in employ-
 ment and provision of other services. Although the law contains provisions for phys-
 ical access for the disabled to all new public and private buildings, the authorities
 have not uniformly enforced this law. To improve opportunties for disabled citizens,
 the Government created a Subsecretariat or Rehabilitation under the Secretariat
 of Public Health, established a new recreation center for the disabled in Las Caobas,
 founded a new department in the Sports Secretariat to facilitate athletic competi-
 tions for the disabled, and instructed the Secretariat of Education to begin a pilot
 project integrating mentally retarded children into the public school system.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-A strong prejudice against Haitians runs
 through society, disadvantaging many Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian ancestry.
 The Government has not acknowledged the existence of this discrimination nor
 made any efforts to combat it. Darker-skinned Dominicans also face informal bar-
 riers to social and economic advancement.
 Credible sources charge that the Government at times, in violation of the Con-
 stitution, refuses to recognize and document as Dominican citizens individuals of
 Haitian ancestry born in the country. Children born to Haitian parents are caught
 in a bureaucratic dilemma: Since many Haitian parents have never processed docu-
 mentation for their own birth, they are unable to demonstrate their own citizenship.
 As a result, they cannot declare their children's births at the civil registry and
 thereby establish Dominican citizenship for their offspring. Some civil registry of-
 fices do not accept late declarations of birth for children of Haitian immigrants, al-
 though they routinely accept late declarations for children of Dominican parents.
 Lack of documentation also sometimes hinders the ability of children of Haitian de-
 scent to attend school where there is one available. Some parents fail to seek docu-
 mentation for fear of being deported.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the freedom to orga-
 nize labor unions and for the right of workers to strike (and for private sector em-
 ployers to lock out workers). All workers, except the military and police, are free
 to organize, and workers in all sectors exercise this right.
 Requirements for calling a strike include the support of an absolute majority of
 all company workers whether unionized or not, a prior attempt to resolve the con-
 flict through arbitration, written notification to the Labor Secretariat, and a 10-day
 waiting period following notification before proceeding with a strike. The Govern-
 ment respects association rights and places no obstacles to union registration, affili-
 ation, or the ability to engage in legal strikes.
 The 1992 Labor Code provides extensive protection for worker rights and specifies
 the steps legally required to establish a union, federation, and confederation. The
 code calls for automatic recognition of a union if the Government has not acted on
 its application within a specific time. In practice, the Government has readily facili-
 tated recognition of labor organizations. Organized labor represents little more than
 10 percent of the work force and is divided among three major confederations, four
 minor confederations, and a number of independent unions. Unions are independent
 of the Government and political parties. However, there were reports of widespread
 discreet intimidation by employers of union activity. For example, union members
 in free trade zones (FTZ's) report that they hesitate to discuss union activity at
 work, even during break time, for fear of losing their jobs.
 Labor unions can and do freely affiliate regionally and internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is law-
 ful and may take place in firms in which a union has gained the support of an abso-
 lute majority of the workers. Only a minority of companies has collective bargaining
 pacts. The Labor Code stipulates that workers cannot be dismissed because of their
 trade union membership or activities.
 The Labor Code establishes a system of labor courts for dealing with disputes, but
 these courts have proven ineffective at enforcing the law. There were many reports
 of bribes solicited by labor judges from companies during the deliberation process.
 The new Supreme Court began an overhaul of the labor courts, dismissing the presi-
 dent of the labor court in Santo Domingo.
 The State Sugar Council (CEA) employs workers from more than 100 unions. Do-
 minican workers predominate in most of the unions, although two unions are Hai-
 tian-dominated. The CEA has long maintained a negative attitude toward additional
 organizing efforts.
 
 
 The Labor Code applies in the 36 established FTZ's, which employ approximately
 182,000 workers, mostly women. Workplace regulations and their enforcement in
 the FTZ's do not differ from those in the country at large, although working condi-
 tions are sometimes better. Some FTZ companies have a history of discharging
 workers who attempt to organize unions. Although there are approximately 70
 unions in the FTZ's, many exist only on paper. The majority are affiliated with the
 National Federation of Free Trade Zone Workers.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, including that performed by children, and it is not known to occur.
 However, there were numerous credible reports of forced or coerced overtime in fac-
 tories. There have been reports of workers being fired for refusing to work overtime,
 and both employers and workers state that newly hired workers are not informed
 that overtime is optional.
 Haitian sugar cane workers continued to encounter restrictions on their freedom
 of movement. These include armed guards on the plantations who try to discourage
 the movement of departing workers before they leave company lands. Experts from
 NGO's and union officials agree that working and living conditions among Haitian
 cane workers have improved in the past 5 years. Plantations have improved sani-
 tary facilities and sometimes provide one meal per day to workers.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The
 Labor Code prohibits employment of children under 14 years of age and places re-
 strictions on the employment of children under the age of 16. These restrictions in-
 clude a limitation of no more than 6 hours of daily work, no employment in dan-
 gerous occupations or establishments serving alcohol, and limitations on nighttime
 work. The law requires 6 years of formal education. The law prohibits forced or
 bonded labor by children, and it is not known to occur (see Section 6.c.).
 The high level of unemployment and lack of a social safety net create pressures
 on families to allow children to earn supplemental income. The International Labor
 Organization estimated in August that 169,000 children between the ages of 7 and
 14 hold jobs. The Government did not sanction the parents of these children. When
 a fireworks factory suffered an explosion in Santo Domingo in September, all five
 workers killed were children, four of them 12 years old or younger.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Constitution provides the Government
 with legal authority to set minimum wage levels and the Labor Code assigns this
 task to a national salary committee. Congress may also enact minimum wage legis-
 lation. The minimum monthly salary is $138 (1,932 pesos) in the free trade zones
 and ranges from $111 (1,555 pesos) to $172 (2,412 pesos) outside the FTZ's depend-
 ing upon the size of the company. This covers only a fraction of the living costs of
 a family in Santo Domingo, but many workers receive only the minimum wage. For
 example, 60 percent of government employees earn only the minimum wage.
 The Labor Code establishes a standard work period of 8 hours per day and 44
 hours per week. The code also stipulates that allworkers are entitled to 36 hours
 of uninterrupted rest each week. In practice, a typical workweek is Monday through
 Friday plus a half day on Saturday, but longer hours are not unusual. The code
 grants workers a 35 percent differential for work from 44 hours to 68 hours per
 week and double time for any hours above 68 hours per week.
 The Dominican Social Security Institute (IDSS) sets workplace safety and health
 conditions. The existing social security system does not appl to all workers and is
 underfunded. In September the Government denounced the fact that many employ-
 ers withhold social security payments from employee paychecks, but do not transfer
 the funds to the IDSS. The Government estimated that the IDSS lost $11 million
 (160 million pesos) each month through such tax evasion schemes, paying out a
 third less to retirement funds than it had planned.
 Both the IDSS and the Labor Secretariat have small corps of inspectors charged
 with enforcing standards. Inspector positions are customarily filled through political
 patronage. In practice, workers cannot remove themselves from hazardous work-
 place situations without jeopardy to continued employment. In many companies, the
 restroom facilities are unsanitary and emergency exits remain locked at all times.
 Conditions for agricultural workers are in general much worse, especially in the
 sugar industry. On many sugar plantations, cane cutters are paid by the weight of
 cane cut rather than hours worked. Sometimes employers do not provide trucks to
 transport the newly cut cane at the conclusion of the workday, causing workers to
 receive lower compensation after the cane has dried out and become lighter. Many
 cane cutters earn approximately $4.50 (60 pesos) per day. Many worker villages
 have high rates of disease and lack schools, medical facilities, running water, and
 sewage systems. Workers on sugar plantations sometimes receive coupons as part
 of their wages, which can only be redeemed at a company store with inflated prices.
