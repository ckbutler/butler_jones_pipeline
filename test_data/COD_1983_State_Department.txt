 ZAIRE
 Zaire shares the problems of most sub-Saharan African countries
 including low income levels and inadequate infrastructure and
 health care. It has been particularly hard hit by 10 years of
 low base metals prices and the global recession. Over the
 years of extreme difficulty, Zaire has made unsuccessful
 attempts at economic stabilization, but in January 1983, Zaire
 launched a-new, serious, and extensive economic reform program
 which led to a new International Monetary Fund (IMF) program in
 December 1983.
 The role of women in Zairian society is given great emphasis
 in the party doctrine and ideology. There is a growing number of
 women in the professions, government, and universities. In the
 last cabinet shuffle, the party organ for women's affairs was
 incorporated into a ministry and its former secretary general, a
 dynamic and highly visible female official, is now the Minister
 of Social and Women's Affairs. Nevertheless, the role of women
 is still restrained by custom.
 The Zairian Government is formally committed to human rights
 and in 1983 took steps to enhance respect for them. The most
 significant development in 1983 was the May 19 general political
 amnesty. Political prisoners were unconditionally released (and
 their civil and political rights restored) and political refugees
 (including those who had gone into self-imposed-exile) were
 invited to return to the country. At the same time, sentences
 were reduced for criminal cases involving fraud and embezzlement
 of government funds and some 300 such prisoners released. In
 1983 for the first time, civilian security, gendarmerie, and
 Department of Justice authorities granted the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) regular access to detention
 centers and prisons under their jurisdiction, but ICRC access to
 the Zairian security service prison was suspended in August.
 (See Section 4 below.) There were fewer unexplained cases of
 permanent disappearance of prisoners or detainees and fewer
 allegations of torture than in previous years. Zaire continued
 to provide safehaven to some 315,000-350,000 refugees, principally
 from neighboring countries.
 Prison conditions remained poor and several dozen deaths have
 occurred from starvation and inadequate medical care. There are
 continuing reports of inadequately paid civilian and military
 law enforcement officials harassing people arbitrarily and
 extorting bribes. People remained in preventive detention for
 long periods of time during investigation because of shortages
 of lawyers and magistrates and of insufficient funds for such
 basics as transportation between prisons and courtrooms.
 The practical limits on political expression and open dissent
 are illustrated by actions taken in November 1983 against a
 group of former parliamentarians who have been seeking to
 organize and promote a constitutionally prohibited second
 political party. The "Group of 131 were sentenced to 15 years
 imprisonment in June 1982, then released under the May 1983
 amnesty. They continued to agitate openly, despite President
 
 (409)
 
 
 410
 Mobutu's warnings. In mid-November, the Government barred the
 most outspoken of the group from Kinshasa and placed them
 under administrative surveillance--with their familes--in
 their villages of origin. As of January 1984 at least one
 member of the group was in prison and a number of supporters
 were also in prison.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Amnesty International's January 1983 report alleges killings
 for political motives. There is no other reliable information
 from which to confirm the report.
 b. Disappearance
 In 1983 there were continued reports of disappearances among
 prisoners, but there were no reliable figures.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Physical punishment is not administered as part of sentences;
 however, abuses in jails, such as beatings, do occur. Prison
 conditions are poor and continue to deteriorate nationwide.
 Unsanitary facilities and malnutrition exist, and several
 dozen cases of starvation occurred in 1983. These conditions
 are due to poor economic conditions, lack of funds, and
 neglect.
 There have been efforts in the past year to improve conditions.
 High-level judicial officials and police officers were suspended
 from duty for misappropriation of funds resulting in deaths of
 prison inmates. Implementation of judicial and penal reforms
 designed to limit detention abuses, reduce the prison population
 and improve prison management continues to be slow, but during
 1983 some 300 (of a total 8,000 to 10,000 prisoners) were "con-
 ditionally released" (paroled). Prisons in remote areas of the
 country feed inmates by allowing them to farm, hunt, and fish.
 Families are usually permitted to provide additional food and
 supplies. An ICRC pilot program in 1982-1983 for prison
 improvement focussing on sanitation and food self-sufficiency
 has been partially successful in improving sanitation in some
 prisons.
 There is a significant incidence of brutality, extortion, and
 harassment of the populace by law enforcement officers (gen-
 darmes and military) throughout the country. Police and
 military security officials often administer beatings at the
 time of arrest and during interrogation. For example, six
 Zairians participating in an illegal political rally were
 beaten in an incident witnessed by members of an American
 Congressional delegation. Poorly paid police and soldiers

 Zaire is a centralized one-party state. President Mobutu, who
 seized power in 1965, heads both the state (appointing the
 Prime Minister and his cabinet) and the party (appointing the
 members of its Central Committee, the highest organ). The
 President has the constitutional power to promulgate laws by
 decree. In theory, authority is shared with the popularly-
 elected Legislative Council. In practice, however, the
 parliament rarely disagrees with presidential decisions,
 although decrees are usually preceded by consultations with
 party leaders and legislators.
 The single party, the People's Revolutionary Movement, auto-
 matically includes all citizens as members. The Executive
 Council (Prime Minister and Council of Ministers), the Legis-
 lative Council (parliament popularly-elected from party
 approved candidates), the judiciary and the only labor union
 (National Union of Zairian Workers) are organs of the same
 ruling party. Seats in the Legislative Council are contested
 by several candidates. The party-state derives its ideology
 from the ideas and policies of its President-Founder, Mobutu
 Sese Seko.
 A complex of security organizations, notably the civilian
 National Documentation Agency, the Gendarmerie, the Armed
 Forces, particularly the G-2 or intelligence branch, and the
 Special Presidential Brigade have been set up and divide
 responsibility for identifying and controlling potential
 threats to Zaire and the Mobutu government, both internal and
 external. The wide powers and influence of these organizations
 often result in harassment and detention of ordinary citizens
 as well as political opponents of the Government. In addition
 to regular security officials, elements of the youth wing of
 the party often perform surveillance and quasi-security
 activities.
 Zaire has borders with nine African nations, a few of which
 have strong economic and military ties with the Soviet Union,
 and some of which have served as bases of operations for
 secessionist movements and political opposition against Zaire.
 Zaire's evolution from the colonial era to independent state-
 hood was particularly tumultuous; civil war and anarchy kept
 the country in international headlines for several years in
 the 1960s. Regional and tribal leaders, aided by European
 mercenaries, overshadowed an impotent central authority in the
 capital, Kinshasa, until President Mobutu, backed by the armed
 forces, took over in 1965. The country has twice been invaded
 (1977 and 1978) by rebels based in Angola seeking to form a
 secessionist government. The task of creating and maintaining
 national unity and stability remains a priority concern of the
 country's current political leadership.
 Zaire has a mixed economy. Though most mining and transporta-
 tion enterprises are owned by the state, private enterprise is
 the rule in other sectors, with the state often holding a
 minority equity position in larger firms. Individuals are
 permitted to pursue private business interests in almost all
 sectors of the economy and are allowed to hold private property.
 
 
 412
 resort to extortion and harassment of local citizens thus
 compounding the problem of abuse of authority. Discipline
 among police is poor and has resulted in civil disturbances,
 exemplified by an incident in Aru, Haut Zaire, in June 1983,
 when gendarmes burned houses and killed several people after
 citizens had caught a gendarme stealing. On occasion security
 personnel have been punished for misconduct.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary arrest and detention of both common criminals and
 suspected opponents of the regime remain problems. Habeas
 corpus and bail do not exist. Legally, people can be held in
 preventive detention during investigation but should be brought
 before a magistrate (with counsel if desired) to hear charges
 within 48 hours of arrest. In practice, detainees--both
 security and civil cases--are often held for months without
 appearing before a magistrate since investigations may be
 delayed or not conducted at all. Some detainees are released
 after months of detention without being brought to trial;
 others are released but placed under restriction (e.g., house
 arrest) during the investigation. Of some 115 people arrested
 in early 1983 on corruption charges, two dozen were tried and
 sentenced. Most were released for lack of evidence after six
 months in prison.
 There are no reliable estimates of the number of persons across
 the country arbitrarily arrested or detained, but in September
 1983 at the central prison in Kinshasa, an estimated 500 of the
 approximately 2,000 inmates were being held without charge or
 benefit of due process. Another 1,050 were reported charged
 but not yet brought to trial; of these, some may have been held
 as long as two years awaiting trial. Subsequent to the May
 1983 amnesty in which all political prisoners were released
 unconditionally, in August more than 100 supporters of a move-
 ment to create a second political party were arrested in
 Kinshasa and in Kasai Oriental province; most were released
 after a week, but several remain in detention pending investiga-
 tion.
 The problem of detention without charge also exists in the
 interior of the country; there the shortage of magistrates and
 lawyers is more severe. (There are only some 600 magistrates
 in the country--roughly one per 50,000 people--and the majority
 are located in the major towns. There are some 250 lawyers in
 the country, 200 of whom are in Kinshasa itself.) High-level
 judicial authorities cite numerous cases of detainees remaining
 in prison without appearing before a magistrate because of lack
 of transportation between prisons and courtrooms. Corruption
 is common among irregularly and inadequately paid security
 officials and policemen. Knowledge of law and procedure is
 scanty. Until the publication in September 1983 of the revised
 Zairian penal code magistrates, particularly those outside
 Kinshasa, had to work from outdated texts or informal notes.
 In connection with the new code, the Government is also conduct-
 ing a series of training seminars for magistrates throughout
 the country to raise awareness of not only the laws and the
 duties of magistrates, but also the rights of the accused.
 
 
 413
 Non-judicial sanctions against persons whom officials-suspect
 of threatening the security of the state are authorized by law
 and range from administrative detention and house arrest to
 banishment to native villages and restriction of movement and
 travel. Such practices are of long standing in Zaire, origina-
 ting in Belgian pre-independence days. Several prominent
 opposition leaders freed under the spring amnesty were so
 exiled in November. Exile or expulsion from the country is
 not a common practice. There were no known cases of expulsion
 or exile in 1983.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 According to the Constitution, defendants have the right to a
 public trial and defense counsel of their choice. Defense
 counsel are generally free from government pressure. In
 practice, because of a shortage of lawyers and the low level
 of legal education among the general populace, most citizens
 are not aware of their right to a defense counsel, a public
 trial, and appeal. Indigent defendants are sometimes assigned
 free counsel by the courts.
 The fairness of trials is not uniform. Poorly paid judges
 have been known to solicit and accept bribes. The Government
 has taken corrective action by firing some magistrates. The
 right of appeal applies to all judgments except those from the
 Court of State Security, and most defendants who are aware of
 their rights avail themselves of the right to appeal.
 The Court of State Security was established in 1972 to hear
 cases involving threats to national security, armed robbery,
 and smuggling. The procedures outlined for legal protection
 in civil courts are available to defendants in security
 courts, except that the latter's judgments cannot be appealed.
 Procedures for military courts are provided for in the military
 penal code, and normally these courts hear only cases involving
 military personnel. In times of military operations and emer-
 gencies, the President can suspend the civilian courts and
 require all cases to be heard in military courts.
 Prior to the general amnesty of May 1983, there were an esti-
 mated 250-300 political prisoners--people sentenced for essen-
 tially non-violent expression of political beliefs. With the
 amnesty, the Government claimed to have released all political
 prisoners, including the 12 ex-parliamentarians who had been
 sentenced in June 1982 to 15 years imprisonment, for attempting
 to create a second party. Several of those ex-parliamentarians,
 however, were banished without hearing in November for the same
 offense.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The state party and security organizations extend down to the
 neighborhood, and both the party and the National Documentation
 Agency maintain liaison offices in all government agencies
 (such as the universities, Legislative Council, Ministry of
 
 
 414
 Justice, etc.). All Zairians 18 years and older are automatic-
 ally members of the party. Party officials, civil servants,
 armed forces personnel, parliamentarians, and employees of
 state enterprises pay an obligatory tax to support the activi-
 ties of the party's major organs (cadre training, mobilization
 and propaganda, and youth). These party "cadres' are also
 required to attend the party's Institute Makanda Kabobi which
 provides ideological orientation. The institute functions as
 a conference center where ordinary and special sessions on
 party ideology and doctrine are conducted by Central Committee
 members. Non-attendance is reported by security agents and
 can result in reprimands and suspensions. Government employees,
 market women, and blue-collar workers are often required to
 participate in public events--parades, official arrivals and
 departures, etc. In such cases, numbered cards are passed out
 and citizens must present themselves or risk being suspended
 from work.
 In civil cases where defendants have been found guilty of
 fraud or embezzlement from the Government, the defendants'
 homes and possessions can be seized and confiscated without
 reimbursement. Mail is opened sporadically by security services,
 some telephone conversations are tapped, and there are networks
 of government informers who monitor places of residence as well
 as work. In line with the party-state's ideology of "Zairian
 authenticity," Zairian men are forbidden by party decision to
 wear ties and women to wear pants and wigs. Zairians are also
 forbidden to use Western names.
 Judicial warrants are required by law before the police are
 permitted to search a home, except in cases of threats to
 national security. However, police and security authorities
 have been known to enter and search without such warrants.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Zairian Constitution guarantees the right of every Zairian
 citizen to express freely his opinions and feelings, whether
 orally or in writing. However, like all other constitutional
 rights, freedom of expression is qualified by the need to
 ensure "public order and good conduct." The media are expected
 to promote the development of the country, according to the
 ideals and principles set forth by Zaire's political party.
 Radio and television are owned and operated by the Government,
 but the three major newspapers are privately owned. Media
 censorship tends to be self-imposed: journalists must be
 members of the state-controlled press union in order to practice
 their profession, and the threat of ouster from the union and
 consequent loss of livelihood is a most effective form of
 intimidation. Journalists whose writings are found offensive
 are promptly punished, ranging from firing the offender (as
 occurred in two instances in 1983) to suspending or closing the
 newspaper (as last occurred in late 1982).
 
 
 415
 Journalists are circumspect in their criticism of high officials,
 although criticism of certain government practices, inadequate
 services, and corrupt officials frequently appears in print.
 Commentary on politically sensitive internal issues as well as
 foreign policy options is discouraged, and direct criticism of
 the President is forbidden.
 Views which run counter to the official party line are denied
 an outlet in the media. There are several clandestine presses
 which operate sporadically and are critical of the ruling
 elite. Popular theater, popular songs, and organized street
 gossip are significant forms of communicating popular opinion
 and news.
 Artistic and academic freedom of expression is subject to the
 same restrictions and self-censorship as the press. From time
 to time books, records, films, and certain issues of magazines
 are banned. Imported publications, including books and period-
 dicals, are subject to censorship if they are critical of
 Zaire, or its government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Only the party and its sub-groups may hold public meetings.
 The Government permits the existence of non-politial self-
 help ethnic associations and religious organizations, but
 these have had their meetings disrupted on occasion because
 of purported political activities. The Government also began
 in August 1983 to enforce in Kinshasa the requirement for
 permits for any gathering of more than five people and for
 any meeting which continues after nine p.m. These measures,
 along with the closure of some bars and restaurants in Kinshasa,
 have been taken to curtail the activity of supporters of an
 illegal second political party.
 The Government recognizes one labor union, the National Union
 of Zairian Workers, which is a semi-autonomous unit of the
 party; its secretary-general is a member of the party's Central
 Committee. The union works with the Government to establish
 wage scales and employee benefits, and is limited in its
 ability to promote worker interests when these differ from
 those of the Government. The workers' right to strike, although
 codified in the labor law, has not been exercised, because the
 union is required first to participate in lengthy arbitration
 and appeals procedures. In early 1983, however, there were
 short-lived wildcat strikes in virtually every sector of the
 economy, which resulted in some improvements in strikers' pay.
 All workers employed in the public and private sectors are
 members of the national union--some 800,000 in 1983. The
 majority of workers (55 percent), however, are employed in
 unregulated small commerce and agriculture and, therefore, are
 not covered by the union. The national union's relations with
 international labor organizations are consistent with general
 Zairian foreign policy orientation. The union participates
 regularly in the International Labor Organization and plays an
 active role in the Organization of African Trade Union Unity.
 The AFL-CIO's African-American Labor Center is represented in
 Zaire.
 
 
 416
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government officially sanctions most of the major world
 religions, and there are established procedures for new
 churches to obtain legal recognition. The four major reli-
 gions in Zaire are Catholicism (50 percent), Protestantism (25
 percent), Islam (5 percent) and Kimbanguism (10 percent), a
 Protestant off-shoot recognized by the World Council of
 Churches. Traditional religious groups are tolerated but not
 legally recognized. The Government periodically bans those
 religious groups considered to present a political or religious
 challenge.
 Recognized religions are free to establish places of worship
 and to train clergy. Expatriate missionaries are allowed to
 proselytize and otherwise serve both Zairian and expatriate
 congregations. Links with co-religionists outside the country
 are maintained; the Vatican is officially represented in
 Zaire. Religious affiliation does not confer either advantage
 or disadvantage in secular status. Relations between the
 Catholic Church and the Government have been tense at times
 with the Government attempting to intimidate church leaders by
 monitoring their activities and threatening to disrupt church
 activities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 In principle, any Zairian citizen may obtain a passport and
 exit visa. In practice, this process is sometimes delayed by
 an overtaxed administration, or on occasion impeded by govern-
 ment and security officials to prevent or disrupt travel of
 those suspected of political opposition. A married woman must
 have her husband's authorization before obtaining a passport,
 but she need not have his approval to travel. Travel within
 Zaire is unrestricted. All citizens, refugees, and permanent
 residents must carry government-issued identity cards, and
 police and military officials often set up checkpoints along
 major roads to inspect papers. Those whose papers are not in
 order pay a fine or spend time in jail.
 In May 1983, political refugees were invited to return to
 Zaire within 42 days under the terms of a general amnesty
 which reinstated their civil and political rights. Several
 prominent political exiles returned from Europe. Others
 returned from neighboring countries, including some 2,000 from
 Burundi, without incident. The timeframe may have been too
 short to attract significant numbers of other refugees under
 the May amnesty. However, under the provisions of a previous
 amnesty for political refugees, declared in 1978, some 190,000
 Zairian refugees have returned to their homes. Negotiations
 are underway to repatriate several thousand Zairian refugees
 from Angola, Zambia, and Tanzania.
 Zaire continues to provide savehaven to over 315,000 refugees.
 Generally, these people are allowed to seek employment and
 settle on farms, and they become self-sufficient and integ-
 rated into the Zairian economic system within a few years of
 
 
 417
 arrival. The Government considers them to be resettled in
 Zaire until such time as they may decide to return to their
 country of origin. Material assistance for these refugees is
 provided primarly by the international community. The Govern-
 ment does not have the resources to provide anything for the
 refugees not provided for Zairian citizens. The refugees
 sometimes suffer from harassment by ill-disciplined armed
 forces. For example, the gendarme rampage in Aru, Haut Zaire
 (see above) affected Ugandan refugees and their propery as
 well as that of local citizens. Some political refugees from
 neighboring countries (primarily Angola) have been detained
 for long periods on suspicion of subversion.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change their Government
 The key instruments of power remain highly centralized and con-
 trolled by the President. Congresses of the ruling party meet
 every five years under the guidance of the President to set
 general national political guidelines which are supplemented by
 resolutions of the party's Central Committee. These policies
 are then executed by the Prime Minister and cabinet--who are
 appointed by the President. The People's Revolutionary Movement
 is the sole political party and the formation of additional
 political parties is constitutionally banned. In 1982 ex-parlia-
 mentarians attempting to organize a second political party were
 tried and sentenced but released in 1983. Several resumed their
 efforts to form a second political party and were banished to
 their home villages as a result.
 Suffrage is universal and all eligible citizens are required to
 vote. Non-voters are subject to arrest and fines. In 1982,
 direct popular elections were held for the first time for
 municipal councils, rural zone councils, and for urban zone
 councils. Elections for the legislative council were also held
 in 1982, five years after the last such elections, as prescribed
 by the constitution. All candidates were first screened by the
 Central Committee, but voters had a choice of an average of five
 approved candidates per district in the parliamentary elections.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government maintains that Zaire has nothing to hide in
 terms of human rights policies, denies charges of systematic
 or serious violations, and during 1983, worked closely with
 the ICRC, both in Geneva and Kinshasa. An ICRC delegation met
 with senior Zairian officials in April, and President Mobutu
 met with the ICRC president in Geneva in mid-year. Civilian
 security, gendarmerie, and military intelligence officials
 permitted for the first time regular ICRC monthly visits to
 their detention centers. The visits to civilian prisons under
 the control of the National Documentation Agency, were suspended
 in August 1983 although visits to gendarmerie prisons continue.
 Military security authorities.(primarily the Special Presidential
 
 
 418
 Brigade) continued to deny full or regular access to their
 detention centers and to persons detained for reasons of
 security.
 Charging that its reports are inaccurate and based on mis-
 information from Zairian exiles in Europe, the Government has
 not allowed Amnesty International to visit Zaire since July
 1982. In a special briefing paper issued in March 1983,
 Amnesty expressed its continuing concerns about prolonged
 detention without charge or trial of suspected political
 opponents of the Government; unfair trials of prisoners of
 conscience, internal banishment of suspected opponents, harsh
 prison conditions, and reports of torture and ill treatment of
 prisoners.
 Although Zaire has been a member of the U.N. Human Rights
 Commission (until 1983) and other international fora dealing
 with human rights issues, it has not played a leading role.
 The Government--and Zairian delegations to these fora--have
 hewed to a consistent position that international action in
 the field of human rights should be strictly circumscribed by
 considerations of non-interference in internal affairs. Zaire
 has not been singled out for particular attention in inter-
 governmental human rights fora. Freedom House describes Zaire
 as "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Zaire is sub-Saharan Africa's second largest country in area
 (over two million square kilometers) and third largest in
 population (about 31 million). The annual population growth
 rate is approximately 2.9 percent. Real gross domestic
 product (GDP) per capita growth was negative in the 1975-1982
 period with per capita GDP in 1983 estimated at $220. Since
 the end of 1982, the Government has successfully instituted an
 economic and financial recovery program suggested by the Inter-
 national Monetary Fund. With the endorsement of international
 financial institutions, Zaire is continuing to liberalize the
 economy and has put into effect reform measures aimed at
 improving its economic development prospects and financial
 management capabilities.
 Approximately 75 percent of the population is engaged in sub-
 sistence agriculture. During the past several years industry
 has operated at only 30 to 40 percent of capacity. One of the
 major objectives of the economic recovery plan is to provide
 the incentives required to boost local production as substitutes
 for costly imports. Unemployment and underemployment are
 serious problems. Since remuneration in the public services
 sector is inadequate and sporadic, many civil servants must
 supplement their income through commercial activities. Low
 salaries and job insecurity have contributed to corruption in
 the Government and military. Low wage levels will remain a
 problem, although government reforms include a new minimum
 agricultural wage, a higher minimum industrial wage, and
 revision of the Government's own personnel system to provide
 comparable pay for similar work throughout the military
 and civil services.
 
 
 419
 Women's rights to own property and participate in the poli-
 tical and economic sectors are protected by law. However,
 married women must obtain their husband's authorization before
 opening a bank account, accepting a job, or renting or selling
 real estate. Women generally earn less than their male counter-
 parts in the same jobs.
 Because of low capital investment and maintenance, Zaire's
 basic infrastructure--particularly transportation, marketing
 and communications--has deteriorated steadily since indepen-
 dence in 1960. The absence of reliable and reasonably priced
 transport impedes the movement of agricultural products from
 food exporting to importing areas. The high cost of trans-
 port and overall inflation make even staple foods expensive
 for the average Zairian. Malnutrition, widespread among both
 urban and rural inhabitants, is probably 'the single most serious
 .health problem, contributing to high rates of illness and death
 from other causes. Life expectancy in 1980 was 47 years. Health
 care is curative rather than preventive and is extremely limited
 in quality and availability in both the urban and rural areas.
 Recent government attention to these problems has included
 expanded vaccination programs and increased funding for a pro-
 gram to combat childhood diseases. To stimulate food production,
 price liberalization and other efforts are underway to encourage
 greater private initiative, and rural road rehabilitation is
 being emphasized.
 The literacy rate in Zaire for persons over 15 varies region-
 ally, but is about 58 percent nationwide with rates lower in
 rural areas and lowest for rural women. There are only a
 quarter as many girls enrolled in primary schools as there are
 boys. Lack of books and supplies, high drop out rates at all
 levels, and frequent teacher strikes have contributed to declin-
 ing quality of education at all levels throughout the country.
 Unofficial regional and ethnic quotas in the university system
 are designed to protect various ethnic groups from exclusion.
