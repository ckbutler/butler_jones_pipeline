 BOLIVIA
 Bolivia is a multiparty democracy with an elected president
 and bicameral legislature. The free elections held in 1985
 were part of the first constitutional transition from one
 civilian government to another in 20 years. Neither of the
 two leading candidates received an absolute majority, and the
 Bolivian Congress selected Dr. Victor Paz Estenssoro to be
 President, in accordance with procedures outlined in the
 Constitution. Paz Estenssoro took office on August 6, 1985.
 Police security forces and the military respected the
 democratic process in 1988, accepting policy direction by the
 civilian Government. The Government used military forces only
 once--to secure petroleum refineries during the petroleum
 workers' strike in March--to ensure domestic order.
 Bolivia is the second poorest country in the Western
 Hemisphere, and its economy made only slight gains in 1987 and
 1988 after declining for the previous 5 consecutive years.
 Although reasonably rich in natural resources, high production
 costs and low prices in the mining sector led to large-scale
 layoffs and significantly raised the nation's unemployment
 rate, which exceeded 20 percent in 1987 and declined only
 slightly in 1988.
 The Paz administration's stringent economic reforms are
 strongly opposed by organized labor. Although petroleum
 workers and students staged sometimes violent major strikes
 and demonstrations in 1988, the Government succeeded in
 maintaining public order without imposing a state of siege.
 The Government has undertaken an extensive antinarcotics
 campaign which has met with considerable criticism and
 resistance, particularly from peasant farmers. Over 2,000
 hectares of coca plants had been eradicated by the end of the
 program's first year. In July the Bolivian Congress passed,
 and President Paz Estenssoro signed, a tough new law to
 counter narcotics trafficking.
 Human rights are provided for in the Constitution and
 generally respected in Bolivia. However, people of European
 or mixed-race origin continue to dominate the political
 system. There continue to be occasional reports of abuse of
 prisoners and detainees by police and security officials as
 well as concerns about an overburdened and sometimes corrupt
 judicial system. Bolivian women do not enjoy a status in
 society equal to that of men, but are slowly achieving a
 greater role in business and professional life.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no political killings in 1988. In September there
 were unconfirmed press reports accusing a military unit of
 killing a peasant farmer in Achacachi, La Paz Department, on
 August 31. Labor and human rights groups have denounced the
 slowness of the official investigation into the alleged
 incident. At the end of the year, no results had yet been
 announced.

 BOLIVIA
 Several people died during civil and labor-related
 disturbances in 1988. Student-worker confrontations with
 police in Potosi at the end of April resulted in the death of
 one demonstrator and injuries to about 150 people, including a
 number of police. Another student demonstrator died as the
 result of a gunshot wound inflicted during a demonstration at
 the university in La Paz in March. On June 27 coca growers
 demonstrating against the antinarcotics legislation then under
 consideration in the Bolivian Congress penetrated an
 antinarcotics police compound in Villa Tunari, Cochabamba
 Department, attacking the police and threatening U.S.
 government personnel. Shots were fired and in the ensuing
 melee at least 10 demonstrators died, most by drowning in a
 dangerous river which abuts the compound or by being trampled
 in the panic and flight.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances
 in Bolivia in 1988. Judicial proceedings are continuing in
 cases involving disappearances during the early 1980's, before
 the restoration of democracy.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture, and the Government neither
 condones nor practices such activity. Nevertheless, there
 continue to be occasional charges of cruelty and degrading
 treatment. Police, prison, and security personnel are rarely
 tried and punished for such acts. Corruption, malnutrition,
 and unsanitary conditions are endemic in Bolivia's under-
 financed prison system.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution requires a court order for an arrest, and
 detainees must be charged or released within 24 hours. The
 Constitution also provides for a judicial determination of the
 legality of a detention, and prisoners are usually released if
 a judge rules that they have been detained illegally. After
 the initial detention, prisoners may consult a lawyer of their
 choice. Provisions for bail exist in Bolivia except in
 certain narcotics cases, and bail is generally granted. Under
 a state of siege, authorities may detain persons for up to 48
 hours before obtaining an arrest order.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The constitutional right of fair public trial is adhered to,
 but long delays in the judicial system are common.
 Investigations, trials, and appeals procedures are so lengthy
 that some prisoners eventually serve more time than the
 maximum sentence for the crime with which they are being
 charged. Defendants have the right to an attorney, to
 confront witnesses, to present evidence, and to appeal a
 judicial decision. These rights generally are upheld in
 practice. Although the law provides for a court-appointed
 defense attorney at public expense, if necessary, one may not
 always be provided because of a shortage of funds and
 qualified personnel. The Constitution authorizes the Supreme
 Court, Bolivia's highest civilian judicial body, to review
 
 
 464
 BOLIVIA
 legislative measures to determine if they are in accordance
 with a citizen's "concrete rights or the Constitution."
 The military Government of 1976 revised the military penal
 code and established the military court system. The law
 defined and established military jurisdiction over actions
 against the security of the state and against military
 personnel and property.
 Corruption of the judicial system remains a serious problem,
 as narcotics traffickers routinely try to bribe judicial and
 other officials in exchange for releasing suspected
 traffickers, returning captured drugs, and purging
 incriminating files. In April the President of the Bolivian
 Supreme Court resigned during a dispute with the Chamber of
 Deputies that involved charges of corruption on both sides.
 In a separate matter, the Santa Cruz district Supreme Court
 ordered the suspension of four judicial officials for
 irregularities in the handling of the Huanchaca case, which
 grew out of the 1986 killing of Bolivian scientist Noel Kempff
 Mercado. The Government has taken some steps to discipline
 Bolivia's judicial system. The antinarcotics legislation
 signed into law in July calls for the creation of three-judge
 special narcotics control courts with broad responsibilities.
 They are to function as first-instance tribunals in
 narcotics-related cases
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home and the privacy of citizens' lives
 are protected by the Constitution and normally are respected
 in practice.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 By law, citizens enjoy freedom of speech and exercise it
 widely without government interference. Both state-owned and
 private radio and television stations operate in Bolivia. All
 newspapers are privately owned. Since the restoration of
 democracy in 1982, Bolivians have enjoyed a generally
 unrestricted press representing a wide spectrum of political
 views. The Paz Estenssoro Government has not exercised its
 constitutional authority to impose censorship despite
 extensive criticism from the media. However, self-censorship
 by journalists, a holdover from military rule, is widespread.
 On two occasions in 1988, the Government took legal action
 against representatives of the media. In June the Government,
 at the urging of the Chamber of Deputies, temporarily closed
 the privately owned La Paz television Channel 4 and Radio
 Metropolitana after they broadcast an interview with
 then-fugitive narcotics trafficker Roberto Suarez. According
 to press reports, agents of the Interior Ministry in November
 stole or damaged property belonging to Radio Metropolitana.
 In a separate episode in August, the Government ordered the
 arrest of Antonio Peredo, director of the left-wing weekly
 Aqui, after the newspaper published a personal attack on
 President Paz Estenssoro during a controversy concerning
 bonuses for government workers from international
 organizations. Peredo, who was accused of defaming the
 Government, was released on bail after 26 days.
 
 
 465
 BOLIVIA
 The Government has consistently respected academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The rights of peaceful assembly and association are provided
 for by law and generally respected in practice. The
 Government may impose curfews and prohibit public
 demonstrations if it declares a state of siege.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution recognizes Roman Catholicism as the country's
 official religion, and Catholic bishops receive a nominal
 stipend from the State. Although Catholicism predominates in
 Bolivia, many religious groups operate openly and freely. The
 Mormons, Baha'is, Seventh-Day Adventists, Methodists, and
 others freely proselytize and operate churches and training
 centers throughout the country. The small Jewish community
 has not reported any discrimination. Citizens are generally
 free to practice the religion of their choice and to maintain
 links with coreligionists abroad.
 The Government has, however, issued rules designating the
 Roman Catholic Church to coordinate all public ceremonies in
 which governmental authorities and institutions participate.
 In implementing these rules, the Government declared all
 existing religious registrations null and void, and required
 religious groups to reregister. In 1988 the Government
 reiterated that numerous religious groups were operating in
 Bolivia illegally (that is, without legal registration). Some
 Evangelical Protestant groups have complained that they have
 been subjected to more stringent registration procedures than
 the Catholic Church. Some foreign members of the Hari Krishna
 sect were formally ordered to leave Bolivia in 1986, but the
 Bolivian Supreme Court overturned that decree in August 1988.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country; Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on travel within Bolivia or abroad.
 The Government does not impede emigration and guarantees
 departing citizens the right to return. Citizenship is not
 revoked for political reasons. Many Bolivians who either fled
 the country or were exiled for political reasons during the
 tumultuous 1978-82 period returned with the restoration of
 democracy and have enjoyed full freedom without harassment.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Bolivia is a multiparty democracy with an elected president
 and a functioning, independent, bicameral legislature. The
 Government does not oppress opposition groups, which exist
 both in and out of the Congress.
 Suffrage has been universal since the 1952 revolution.
 The December 1987 municipal elections, the first to be held at
 that level in almost 40 years, were deemed by observers to
 have been peaceful and honest, with none of the major parties
 complaining of significant irregularities. National elections
 
 
 466
 BOLIVIA
 are scheduled for May 1989, and the registration process for
 those elections began in orderly fashion in September.
 People of European or mixed-race origin are predominant in the
 political system. There are women who are active participants
 in politics and government, and their numbers are increasing.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is sensitive to the opinions of both
 international and domestic organizations and is willing to
 discuss human rights concerns with them. The Congress has
 committees responsible for monitoring observance of human
 rights. The Catholic Church, the Permanent Assembly of Human
 Rights in Bolivia, and the press generally have been the most
 aggressive monitors of human rights. These organizations
 comment frequently on issues and developments related to human
 rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Although protected in theory by social legislation, Bolivian
 women do not enjoy a status in society equal to that of men.
 Cultural traditions, social conditions, and lack of political
 influence remain the major obstacles to advancement. In rural
 families, women contribute significantly to economic
 activities and often control the family purse strings, but
 nonetheless are considered socially and politically
 subordinate. In urban settings, women are slowly achieving a
 greater role in business and professional life, as their
 participation in cooperatives, community affairs, and
 education increases.
 The Constitution prohibits social discrimination, but Bolivians
 of mixed European origin do discriminate against people of
 indigenous background. At least partially as a result of this
 treatment, the Aymara- and Quechua-speaking majority of the
 population (60 percent) remains at the lower end of the
 country's socioeconomic scale and is disadvantaged in terms of
 health, life expectancy, education, income, and employment.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Bolivian workers have the right to establish and join
 organizations of their own choosing, and they are free to
 elect their own leaders. They possess and exercise the right
 to strike. Labor law prohibits any labor contract which
 denies workers' constitutional rights and freedoms. The
 Bolivian Workers Central (COB), an umbrella labor organization
 which represents the majority of workers, is independent and
 politically powerful. In past years it has frequently
 paralyzed the economy with crippling strikes. In 1988 it
 mobilized a number of demonstrations on various social and
 economic issues throughout the country. Antigovernment labor
 demonstrations occasionally result in violence between
 demonstrators and police or military personnel.
 The Government places no restrictions on a union's right to
 join international labor organizations. COB Executive
 Secretary Simon Reyes was the spokesman for Bolivian labor at
 
 
 467
 BOLIVIA
 the June meeting of the International Labor Organization in
 Geneva, and the COB is affiliated to the Soviet-controlled
 World Federation of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Bolivian workers have the right to organize and bargain
 collectively. The law does not extend this right to
 government workers, but the distinction is largely ignored in
 practice, as virtually all government workers are unionized.
 Government-employed petroleum workers, for example, conducted
 a brief strike for higher wages and improved benefits in
 March, and teachers also engaged in labor actions during
 1988. In Bolivia's government-dominated economy, negotiations
 between gpvernment representatives and freely elected labor
 leaders are common. In early 1988, the Government invited the
 COB to join government officials in discussions about the
 national budget, which directly controls employee compensation
 in important sectors of the economy.
 After government-union talks reached an impasse and petroleum
 workers went on strike in March, the military secured the
 country's two refineries against vandalism, the government-run
 petroleum company began issuing dismissal notices, and police
 arrested three labor representatives in Santa Cruz on various
 formal charges. The union officials, who were promptly
 charged and brought before a judge, were released after about
 3 weeks.
 Labor laws and regulations are enforced uniformly throughout
 the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Bolivian law prohibits forced or compulsory labor, and neither
 has been reported.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Bolivian law prohibits the employment of minors under 18 years
 of age in dangerous, unhealthy, or immoral work; no other
 restriction on employment of minors exists. Government
 officials state that the revised labor code now in preparation
 should clarify ambiguities in the law concerning the
 employment of children under 14 years of age. In practice
 this law is not rigorously enforced.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Bolivia's labor laws contain conditions for child protection,
 paid vacations, and protection of workers' health and safety.
 In practice these laws are not rigorously observed, and the
 Government has not provided funds for adequate enforcement.
 The mines, often old and operated with antiquated equipment,
 are particularly dangerous and unhealthy. In urban areas,
 most workers (about half the labor force) observe an 8-hour
 day and a 5- or 5 1/2-day workweek.
 Bolivia has a minimum wage law as well as an elaborate system
 of bonuses and compensations for the private sector. In 1988,
 after talks with COB leaders, the Government raised the
 minimum wage to $25 per month. Despite that increase, a
 single minimum wage earner cannot easily support a family at
 an acceptable standard of living. Moreover, labor leaders and
 the Permanent Assembly on Human Rights have expressed concern
 
 
 468
 BOLIVIA
 that continuing high rates of unemployment are contributing to
 a worsening of living conditions, despite the modest economic
 gains of 1987-88.
