 MOROCCO
 The Constitution of Morocco provides that the country shall be governed by con-
 stitutional monarchy with a representative Parliament and an independent judici-
 ary. However, the ultimate authority rests with the King, who retains the discretion
 to terminate the tenure of any minister and dissolve Parliament to rule by decree.
 The current Parliament was formed in 1993 by a two-stage process: the election of
 222 deputies by direct universal suffrage and selection of the remaining 111 depu-
 ties by labor organizations and other constituency groups. International observers
 found the direct elections to be generally fair with some irregularities. However, the
 second stage was marred by credible reports of widespread manipulation and fraud.
 When three major political parties refused to participate in the Government without
 a far-reaching shift in power in favor of the Parliament, the King appointed a gov-
 ernment of technocrats who, with minor changes, remained in office in 1994.
 The security apparatus comprises several overlapping police and paramilitary or-
 ganizations. The Direction de Ia Surveillance du Territoire, Surete Nationale, and
 the judicial police are departments of the Ministry of Interior and Information. The
 Gendarmerie Royale reports directly to the royal palace. Security force abuses con-
 tinued in 1994, especially in cases involving perceived threats to state security.
 Morocco's mixed economy is based on agriculture, fishing, light industry, phos-
 phate mining, tourism, and remittances from overseas workers, with illegal canna-
 bis production a significant factor. Since the early 1980's, the Government has pur-
 sued an economic reform program that has contributed to generally strong economic
 growth, low inflation, and low fiscal and external deficits. The Government has em-
 barked on a program of privatizing state-owned enterprises.
 In 1994 the Government made substantial progress on several human rights
 fronts. The King granted amnesty to 424 political prisoners; the Government began
 paying stipends to former inmates who survived incarceration at the notorious
 Tazmamart Prison; a 1934 law allowing the imprisonment of plitical opponents
 was abrogated; incidents of press censorship decreased; and the Deputy Ministry for
 Human Rights expanded its operations and continued dialogs with local and inter-
 national human rights groups.
 However, several basic human rights problems remained unaddressed. Credible
 reports indicate that security forces frequently abused detainees and prisoners and
 
 
 1144
 caused the deaths of three persons in custody; state agents responsible for past and
 present human rights abuses were not held accountable by the weak and malleable
 jUdicia or even subject to public investigation; many persons remain in prison for
 advocating independence for the Western Sahara; many youn girls remain subject
 to exploitative domestic servitude; and the Government failed to make significant
 reforms in the manipulation-prone electoral system and continued to suspend the
 right to due process and freedom of speech and association.
 The ubiquitous nature of the Ministry of Interior and Information means that vir-
 tually all allegations of governmental human rights abuse involve its employees.
 The Ministry is responsible for authorizing associations and political parties; the
 conduct of elections, including cooperation with the United Nations in a referendum
 on the status of the WesternSahara; the oversight of theprivate press and publica-
 tion of the official news agency releases; the direction of most security forces; the
 appointment and training of many local officials; the allocation of local and regional
 budgets; and the oversight of university campuses. Less formally, the Ministry ex-
 erts substantial pressure on the judicial system In February comments to Par-
 liament, reiterated in November, the Minister of Interior made clear that Ministry
 employees will not be held to answer for allegations of abuse brought by Parliament,
 other ministries, or nongovernmental organizations (NGO's).
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Three deaths of persons in police
 custody may be reasonably attributed to security force brutality. On August 4, offi-
 cers of the Surete Nationale in Khouribga, 75 miles southeast of Casablanca, ar-
 rested Siman Bouchta for selling produce without a permit. A few hours later
 Bouchta was rushed to a hospital, reportedly for treatment of profuse bleeding, and
 he died shortly thereafter. His family has refused to accept his body without the
 performance of an autopsy. Requests for further information by nongovernmental
 human rights organizations have elicited no response from Moroccan authorities.
 According to witnesses, four police officers in Rabat beat Zerzouri Younes about
 the head in front of his parents' home on August 13. He died of his injuries after
 4 days of hospitalization. Younes had no known political affiliations. He was de-
 scribed in a communique issued by the Moroccan Organization for Human Rights
 (OMDH) as emotionally unstable.
 The police arrested Brahim Belfaqir in the city of Sale on November 6 after his
 involvement in a fistfight. He died in police custody the next day. Authorities ruled
 the death a suicide, alleging that Belfaqir had taken an overdose of medication, but
 Belfaqirs family denied that he took any such medication. Belfaqir was not known
 to be politically active. An OMDH appeal to the Ministry of Justice failed to prompt
 a public investigation. In November the Minister of Interior responded to a question
 in Parliament, submitted in writing by a parliamentarian 2 weeks earlier, about
 Belfaqir's death. The Minister reportedy expressed surprise at the news of the
 death and promised an investigation. His response drew laughter from the par-
 liamentarians. He has made no further comments on the case.
 In a fourth case, Mohammed Belqaidi, a former student activist in Fes, died on
 October 27, reportedly as a consequence of a general physical deterioration after re-
 ceiving physical abuse perpetrated by guards while serving a prison term from 1988
 to 1993. Belqaidi reportedly served his sentence in solitary confinement.
 A court proceeding brought by the family of Mustapha Hamaoui, a political activ-
 ist who died in jail in 1993 under suspicious circumstances, was postponed several
 times in 1994 and, according to human rights groups, is unlikely to go to trial.
 OMDH published a report in January that alleged 17 deaths took place from 1989
 to 1993 under circumstances that strongly suggest the use of torture. The Govern-
 ment has not conducted a public inquest into any of these cases.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of new disappearances. In September
 the Minister-Delegate for Human Rights announced that his office had begun a re-
 view of 50 to 60 alleged disappearances, some dating back several years. He added
 that approximately 30 of the dossiers presented strong prima facie cases of dis-
 appearance. At year's end, his office had not released any results of this review.
 Human rights organizations have published higher estimates of the number of
 persons who disappeared permanently after last being seen in the custody of secu-
 rity forces. Many of the additional disappeared persons are Sahrawis, the natives
 of Western Sahara, who publicly advocated independence for that territory. The
 Government has never directly acknowledged that Sahrawis have disappeared-
 even though it released some 300 Sabrawis in 1991 after periods of detention rang-
 ing up to 15 years. However, the King expressly excluded Sahrawi nationalists from
 
 
 1145
 the prisoner amnesty program announced in July, thus indirectly acknowledging
 that some of them remain imprisoned.
 Rashid Benhayoun, a resident of the Casablanca suburb of Mohamadia, dis-
 appeared on March 19 under circumstances implicating a powerful local figure with
 strong associations with the police. This figure should be a prime suspect but seems
 to have successfully prevailed upon police contacts to quash any investigation. In
 response to a request from OMDH, the Minister of Justice publicly agreed to inves-
 tigate the disappearance. This rare public statement from the Minister was greeted
 enthusiastically by local human rights groups. At year's end, the Minister had not
 announced any further action.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although Morocco ratified the United Nations' Convention Against Torture in 1993,
 security forces continued to subject detainees to abuse-including the use of torture
 in cases involving state security. Reliable sources report that Ministry of Interior
 interrogation methods in state security cases were modified in 1992. The guidelines
 proscribe the use of methods likely to leave visible marks or permanent disabilities.
 Hence, the most common methods include sleep deprivation, the chemical induce-
 ment of vomiting fits, and beatings under immobilizing restraint.
 A detainee alleging police abuse must sign an application for medical examina-
 tion, naming the officers involved, and submit it to the court. Very few detainees
 take this step. In a case where evidence of abuse is strong, reliable reports suggest
 that the police typically offer to drop the underlying charges in exchange for a de-
 tainee's agreement to drop the allegation of abuse.
 In June a military tribunal tried several persons for smuggling guns to Muslim
 fundamentalists in Algeria. At trial, the defendants moved to exclude their confes-
 sions from evidence as having been obtained by torture. The trial court and an ap-
 peals court denied the motion without a hearing, despite strong circumstantial evi-
 ence of abuse.
 In May the authorities arrested seven teachers for participating in a rally advo-
 cating teaching the Berber language in public schools. All detainees alleged they
 were mistreated in detention and several, according to press accounts, bore physical
 marks attributable to abuse. Three defendants were convicted of posing a "threat
 to the sanctity of the State," but the court did not rule on the allegation of abuse.
 In cases that do not involve state security, witnesses report that individual police
 officers abuse detainees with i punity on an ad hoc basis.
 Harsh treatment continues aer conviction, especially for prisoners serving sen-
 tences for state security crimes. Several political prisoners released in the July am-
 nesty reported that they suffered years of abuse from their guards, including ran-
 dom assaults deprivation of sleep, and prohibition of family visits. Prison guards
 have reportedly suspended inmates against walls as punishment for violating some
 prison rules.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Prison conditions are harsh. Eleven per-
 sons reportedly died in a 6-month period in one Casablanca prison due either to ill-
 nesses contracted from unhealthy conditions or lack of medical care for preexisting
 conditions. The Government, citing budgetary restraints, has not substantially im-
 plemented the reforms recommended by the Royal Consultative Council on Human
 Rights (CCDH), an advisory body whose members are handpicked by the King, re-
 garding prison overcrowding, medical care, and nutrition. Prisoner hunger strikes,
 although fewer in number in 1994, were common, especially among Islamist pris-
 oners. In a display of openness, the Government granted access by representatives
 of Amnesty International (AI) to its prisons.
 Legal provisions for due process have been revised extensively in recent years, but
 the authorities frequently ignore them. Although arrests usually take place in pub-
 lic, the police sometimes refuse to identify themselves and do not always obtain war-
 rants. The law requires that a detainee be brought before a judge within 48 hours
 of arrest-extendable to 96 hours upon approval of the prosecutor-and informed of
 the pending charges. Incommunicado (garde-a-vue) detention is limited to 48 hours,
 with a one-time 24-hour extension at the prosecutor's discretion.
 An accused person must be brought to trial within 2 months of arrest, but pros-
 ecutors may order five additional extensions of pretrial detention of 2 months each.
 Detainees are denied counsel during the initial period of detention when abuse is
 most likely to take place. Counsel is allowed only as of the first cross-examination,
 but many cases are resolved without cross examination.
 Some members of the security forces, long accustomed to indefinite precharge ac-
 cess to detainees, continue to resist the new rules. Lawyers are not always informed
 of the date of detention and are thus unable to monitor compliance with the garde-
 a-vue detention limits. Although the trend towards compliance with the rules con-
 tinued in 1994, there were several exceptions, especially in state security cases, the
 
 
 1146
 most publicized of which involved the gun-running and Berber speech cases (see
 Section 1.c.).
 The law provides for a limited system of bail, but it is rarely used. Nevertheless,
 the courts sometimes release defendants on their own recognizance. The law does
 not provide for habeas corpus or its equivalent. Under a separate code of military
 justice military authorities may detain members of the military without warrants
 or public trial.
 In March the Minister-Delegate for Human Rights announced that the Govern-
 ment had begun making payments of 5,000 dirhams (about $550) per month to 28
 former inmates who survived incarceration at the notorious Tazmamart Prison. He
 also acknowledged that 30 other prisoners had died there. In November the Min-
 ister-Delegate announced that the Government would issue death certificates to
 families of the deceased prisoners. All 58 former inmates had been sentenced, after
 mass trials, as accomplices in attempts on the King's life in 1971 and 1972. The typ-
 ical member of the Tazmamart group was convicted of passive involvement in the
 plots-those convicted of active participation were executed-and sentenced to a 3-
 year prison term. Notwithstanding those sentences, the survivors each served 18 to
 20 years in solitary confinement, with a complete absence of sanitary facilities and
 medical care. The Government offered no information on the prisoners to their fami-
 lies during their confinement, and even refused to confirm the existence of the de-
 tainees.
 The Government released the Tazmamart group without explanation in 1991, on
 condition that they do not publicly discuss the circumstances of their confinement.
 The former inmates have quietly sought redress with the assistance of Moroccan
 human rights groups, particularly the Moroccan Association for Human Rights
 (AMDH). No government official has been accused of misfeasance in connection with
 Tazmamart. No public investigation is underway nor is any known internal govern-
 ment investigation.
 In the June gun-running case (see Section 1.c), the authorities placed several sus-
 pects in incommunicado detention. They surfaced in a Rabat jail weeks later, after
 charges were brought. At their trial, the defendants moved for dismissal of the case
 for gross violation of the garde-a-vue detention limits. In contradiction to available
 evidence, the court found that the fugitives had spent most of the time after their
 disappearance-and before charges were brought--in flight from the authorities. It
 therefore ruled th at the detention limits were not exceeded.
 The authorities held the defendants in the Berber language case (see Section 1.c.)
 in garde-a-vue detention for more than 2 weeks. Although the three convicted de-
 fendants received reduced sentences on apea and were released in the July am-
 nesty, the obvious violation of garde-a-vue lfuits was not subject to court ruling.
 By contrast, in investigating incidents of violent crime in August, the authorities
 evidently observed the due process rules. The incidents included a shooting at a
 Marrakech hotel which left two dead, and an attempted armored car holdup in Ca-
 sablanca. In the aftermath of those events, police discovered several weapons
 caches, and investigations in foreign countries linked the suspects to terrorist
 groups abroad. Despite the national security implications of these discoveries, no
 evidence of illegal detention or physical abuse has surfaced. In fact, one of the prin-
 cipal suspects, after disparaging the judicial system in a court hearing, later with-
 drew a request for foreign counsel, stating that he had been treated fairly and rep-
 resented professionally.
 Abdessalem Yassine, leader of the banned Islamist organization Justice and Char-
 ity, entered his fifth year of house arrest. Aside from rare meetings with his lawyers
 and family members, the authorities do not allow him to have visitors, nor have
 they filed formal charges against him. However, two members of the CCDH publicly
 acknowledged the illegality of Yassine's continued detention. Neither the Ministry
 of Justice nor the Deputy Ministry for Human Rights has initiated a review.
 There are no known instances of government-impsed exile. As part of the 1994
 amnesty, the Government indicated that any citizen living abroad in self-imposed
 exile would be welcomed to return after taking an oath that acknowledged the legit-
 imacy of the monarchy and the nation's claim to the Western Sahara. Several Mo-
 roccans living in Holland have been repatriated in this fashion, and in December
 the Government began to process claims from Moroccans living in France as well.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-In theory there is a single court system for all
 nonmilitary matters, but family matters such as marriage, divorce, child support
 and custody, and inheritance are adjudicated by judges trained in islamic law, or
 Shari'a. Judges considering criminal cases or cases in nonfamly areas of civil law
 are generally trained in the French legal tradition. All judges appointed in recent
 years are alumni of the _National Institute for Judicial Studies (INEJ) where they
 undergo 2 years of study heavily focused on human rights and the rule of law.
 
 
 1147
 The law does not distinguish political and security cases from common criminal
 cases. In general, detainees are arraigned before a court of first instance. If the in-
 fraction is minor and not contested, te judge may order the defendant released or
 impose a light sentence. If an investigation is required, the judge may release de-
 fendnts on their own recognizance. Cases are often adjudicated on the basis of con-
 fessions obtained during incommunicado detention. Some of these confessions, ac-
 cording to reliable sources, are obtained under duress.
 All Moroccan courts are susceptible to extrajudicial pressures. Salaries paid to
 judges are modest; cash payments to unscrupulous judges are sometimes made in
 routine cases. A more subtle, but doubtless more profound, corruption derives from
 the judiciary's relationship with the Ministry of Interior. The Ministry, through its
 network of local officials, or caids, who serve in tandem with local elected officials,
 interacts regularly with local judges. Through this interaction, the caida transmit
 bth general procedures for various types of cases and advice regarding particular
 cases as needed to the judges. Credible sources report that judges who expect en-
 hanced remuneration and career progression do not stray far from that guidance.
 Attorneys report that newly apointed judges, notwithstanding their INEJ training,
 are even more willing to profit from this arrangement than their predecessors.
 In serious state security cases, communications between the Ministry of Interior
 and the court are more direct. In the gun-running case (see Section 1.c.), if the court
 had a pplied the due process rules the defendants may have been acquitted-a re-
 sult that might have encouraged local Islamists. To avoid that possibility, security
 officers were given virtually unlimited access to the suspects while they were in pre-
 trial detention, and were able to extract confessions. The trial court cooperated in
 the Ministry's effort by retroactively adjusting the date of arrest to comport with
 the garde-a-vue detention limits-an adjustment that allowed the confessions to be
 admitted into evidence.
 In late 1993, the King appointed Idrissi Machichi as Minister of Justice. A legal
 scholar and teacher, Machichi has an international reputation for integrity. While
 there were no fundamental changes in the legal system, Machichi has instituted
 some significant reforms. For example, judges in drug trafficking cases are now as-
 signed on the day of trial; traffickers are thus unable to approach corrupt trial
 judges to arrange a pretrial dismissal of charges. Machichi's presence in office is
 cited by virtually every part of the legal community as hope that the judicial system
 will eventually achieve the independence mandated by the Constitution.
 Aside from external pressures, the court system is also subject to resource con-
 straints. Consequently, criminal defendants charged with less serious offenses often
 receive only cursory hearings, with judges relying on police reports to render deci-
 sions. Although the Government provides an attorney at public expense for serious
 crimes--i.e., when the offense has a maximum sentence of over 5 years-these attor-
 neys often provide inadequate representation.
 July the Government took two important steps to address the problem of politi-
 cal prisoners. First, the Parliament abrogated a 1935 decree which authorized the
 authorities to detain any person regarded as a "threat to the sanctity of the State."
 Originally promulgated during the French Protectorate to suppress nationalists, the
 decree hadbecome the principal legal basis for jailing political opponents.
 Second, the King granted royal amnesty to 424 prisoners, all of whom were con-
 victed under the 1935 decree. Of the freed prisoners, CCDH determined that 11
 were political prisoners and 413 were criminals motivated by political concerns.
 Most of the group of 413 persons were convicted of crimes of violence or vandalism
 in mass trials folowing the 1984 civil disturbances in Tetouan, Casablanca, and
 Fes, as well as the 1990 disturbances in Fes and Tangier. However, several were
 imprisoned for exercising free speech and may also be considered political prisoners.
 Many of the prisoners granted amnesty had rejected government overtures for par-
 dons in previous years boecause any pardon, under appicable law, would have been
 granted only after an admission of guilt.
 The released prisoners included human rights activist Ahmed Belaichi, impris-
 oned in 1992 for televised comments critical of the armed forces, and Islamist leader
 M'bark Missouni, imprisoned in 1991 for distributing Islamist tracts. More than
 100 of those released are Islamists. The human rights community uniformly praised
 the abrogation of the 1935 decree and the amnesty as significant efforts to turn the
 page on a dark era in Moroccan history.
 OMDH estimates that some 110 non-Sabrawis remain in prison. Of these, some
 60 are Islamists. Estimates of the number of persons imprisoned for advocating
 independence for the Western Sahara vary from the Government's position that
 none are held to the claims of some international NGO's that several hundred re-
 main.
 
 
 1148
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution states that the home is inviolable and that the police may not conduct
 a search without a warrant. The law stipulates that search warrants may be issued
 by a prosecutor for good cause. However, there continue to be reports of illegal
 searches of the homes and offices of suspected political activists.
 Government security services monitor the activities of certain persons and organi-
 zations, including their telephones and mail. Government informers also monitor ac-
 tivities on university campuses.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion, but the law and tradition prohibit criticism on three topics: the monarchy, the
 Government's claim to the Western Sahara, and the sanctity of Islam.
 In 1994 a court sentenced union leader Ahmed Mlakgatt to 2 years for question-
 ing the fairness of the 1993 legislative elections. Five residents of the coastal town
 of Bouznika were sentenced to 2 years for committing the same offense. In other
 cases, the courts sentenced three Berber activists from 1 to 2 years for displaying
 a banner calling for the teaching of Berber language courses in schools (see Section
 1.c.), and 14 members of the "Unemployed Graduate Students Association" were
 sentenced from 1 to 2 years for demonstrating against high unemployment. The
 Government released Mlakgatt, the Bouznika residents, and the Berber activists in
 a royal amnesty in July. The students were freed prior to the amnesty.
 The Government significantly restricts press freedom, though the limits are not
 clearly defined. A 1958 decree gives the Government the authority to register and
 license domestic newspapers and journals. It uses this licensing power to prohibit
 the publication of materials deemed to cross the threshold of tolerable dissent. The
 authorities may seize offending publications and suspend the publisher's license. Ar-
 ticle 55 of the Press Code empowers the Ministry of Interior to censor newspapers
 directly by ordering them not publish reports on specific issues.
 In 1994 the Government closed the independent Arabic tabloid, Asrar, without ex-
 planation. The paper circumvented the closure by reorganizing as a new periodical
 Asda. Security officials prohibited the distribution of one issue of Nouvelles du Nord
 because it contained an article critical of the human rights situation in Tunisia.
 The Government tolerates satirical and often stinging editorials in the opposition
 parties' dailies. Particularly sharp editorials in 1994 charged a lack of political lead-
 ership regarding the recognition of Israel and a perceived capitulation to the West
 in opening a liaison office in Israel, both areas in which policy has been orchestrated
 by the Royal Palace. On the other hand, the Government restricted press coverage
 of the gun-smuggling case (see Section 1.c.).
 The Government owns the only television station receivable nationwide without
 a decoder or satellite dish antenna; it does not impede reception of foreign broad-
 casts. Satellite dishes are available, at prices that decreased dramatically in 1994,
 and make available a wide variety of foreign broadcasts. The sole private television
 station may be received in most urban areas with the rental of an inexpensive de-
 coder. Northern residents may receive broadcasts from Spain with standard anten-
 nas.
 A great number of foreign news publications are available, particularly from Eu-
 rope and the United States. The Government generally tolerates a broad spectrum
 of opinion in the foreign press. This was especially true in 1994 as the Government
 hosted several international events, including the conference on the General Agree-
 ment on Tariffs and Trade and the Middle East Economic Summit, which attracted
 hundreds of foreign journalists.
 Despite the trend in recent years towards noninterference with the foreign press,
 the Government continued to prohibit the distribution of publications containing ar-
 ticles regarded as offensive. For example, the authorities seized the March 23 and
 April 28 editions of the French weekly Jeune Afrique because they contained arti-
 cles respectively urging greater government support for a Moroccan national accused
 of murder in France, and reporting alleged contacts between the Polisario Front (a
 group seeking independence for the Western Sahara) and Algerian Islamists. The
 authorities temporarily blocked the distribution of the September 9 edition of the
 French daily Le Monde because it contained an interview in which a Moroccan
 Islamist questioned the King's status as a spiritual leader. The edition was allowed
 full distribution a few days later. Universities enjoy relative academic freedom. The
 Ministry of Interior controls the hiring of instructors, the curriculum in the Faculty
 of Law, and the physical plant, including the residences in all faculties.
 b. Freedom of Peacefud Assembly and Association.-Although the Constitution pro-
 vides for freedom of assembly and association, this right is significantly limited by
 three decrees--promulgated in 1935, 1939, and 1958-that permit the Government
 
 
 1149
 to suppress peaceful demonstrations and mass gatherings. Organizers for most con-
 ferences and7 demonstrations require the prior authorization of the Ministry of Inte-
 rior, ostensibly for security reasons.
 In February the Ministiy of Interior denied without explanation authorization for
 a conference on women s issues planned by three major political arties. The con-
 ferees were to consider the impact of recent changes in the Code oPersonal Status,
 which concerns marriage, divorce, and child custody. In April and June, the Min-
 istry denied permission to AMDH to hold conferences on human rights and democ-
 re onstry               r       o        p l     rf    n t     in support of
 Bosnian Muslims. On June 14, the authorities arrested activists from the Unem-
 ployed Graduate Students Association, an unregistered group tolerated by the Gov-
 ernment, in connection with an unauthorized demonstration at a union head-
 qurters in a small eastern city (see Section i.e.). The authorities did not permit
 O'MDH to hold a reception in Casablanca in honor of the prisoners amnestied in
 July. The authorities also denied organizers to proceed wih Berber cultural con-
 fernces in Agadir andNador. The police forcibly dispersed several demonstrations
 organized by blind students to call attention to their poverty. There were a number
 Of injUries.
 The Government limits the right to establish organizations. Under the 1958 de-
 cree, persons wishing to establish an organization must obtain the approval of the
 Ministry of Interior be fore holding meetings. In practice, the Ministry uses this re-
 quirement to prevent persons suseted of avocating causes opposed by the Gov-
 ernment, particularly Islamist and leftist groups, from establishing lea organiza-
 tions. There are 29 active Islamst groups, but the Government has prohibited meme-
 bership in two of them-Justice and Charity and Jama'a slamia-cause of their
 rhetoric deemed inimical to the monarchy. The Ministry of Interior must approve
 political parties--a power which the Government uses to control participation in the
 political process.
 c. Freedom of Religi.n.-Islam is the official religion. Ninety-nine percent of the
 population is Sunni Muslims, and the King bears the title "Commander of the
 Faithful.~ The Jewish community of approximately 6,000 is permitted to practice its
 faith, as is the somewhat larger foreign Christian community. For the first time in
 memory, the Ministry of Interior in 1994 permitted the broadcast of You Kippur
 services on national television.
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of religion, only Islam, Christian-
 ity and Judaism are tolerated, since the King has pronounced all other religions
 to be heresies. The Government has prohibited the Bea'i community of 150 to 200
 people fommeeting since 1983. Islamic law and tradition call for strict punishment
 of any zusim who converts to another faith. Any attempt to induce a Muslim to
 convert is similarly illegal.
 Foreign missionaries limit their proselytizing to non-Muslims or conduct their
 work quietly. Evangelical missionaries do not turn away Muslims who appear at
 services andBible meetings. In January the Government quietly released from pris-
 on Mustapha Zmamda, a Muslimsentenced to 3 years in prison in 1993 for cor-
 responding with Christian missionaries.
 _The Ministry of Islamic Affairs monitors Friday mosque sermons and the Koranic
 schools to ensure the teaching of approved doctrine. The authorities sometimes sup-
 press the activities of Islamic fundamentalists, but generally tolerate activities re-
 stricted to the propagation of Islam, education, andp charity. Security forces com-
 monly close mosques to the public shortly after Friday services to prevent use of
 the premises for unauthorizedplitical activity
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the County, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom of movement, in prac-
 tice security forces setup roadblocks throughout the country and stop traffic at will.
 In some regions, roadblocks have been maintained in the same places for years.
 Some observers characterize these as internal frontiers. Police regularly extract gra-
 tuities at the roadblocks, particularly from trck drivers. In a move to improve their
 ime, the     lice arrested more than 1,000 travelers in 1994 for attempted bribery
 at the roadblocks. In the aftermath of the August violence and discovery of arms
 catehes (see Section 1.d.), the authorities established additional temporary road-
 blocks, closed the border with Algeria, and subjected Algerian nationals to repeated
 interrogations.
 In the Morocco-administered portion of the Western Sahara, the Government re-
 stricts movement in areas regarded as militarily sensitive.
 The Ministry of Interior restricts freedom to travel abroad in certain cir-
 cumstances. It has refused to issue passports to certain citizens, including political
 activists, former political prisoners, and Bilais. However, the Government has dra-
 matically eased these restrictions in recent years. oMDH currently lists only 22 citi-
 
 
 1150
 
 zens declared ineligible to obtain passports. Some former political prisoners, after
 being issued passports, were denied exit at border points on the ostensible basis
 that government computers had not been changed to reflect their eligibility to leave.
 Women must have permission from either their fathers or husbands to obtain a
 passport. A divorced woman must have her father's permission to obtain a passport
 and, if she has custody of the children, she must have permission of the chldren!s
 father to obtain passports for them. Although the K   has said that the male con-
 sent requirement is contrary to Islam and the Constitution, the Government took
 no action to ease the travel requirements for women.
 There are frequent allegations of corruption in the passport offices; applicants are
 reportedly forced topay gratuities to obtain application forms and toI ake sure the
 forms are not lost. All civil servants must obtain written permission from their min-
 istries each time they seek to travel abroad.
 Moroccans may not renounce their citizenship but the King retains the power-
 rarely used-to revoke it. Tens of thousands of Moroccan hold more than one citi-
 zenship and travel with passports issued by other countries. However, while resid-
 ing inMorocco, the authorities consider them Moroccan citizens. The Government
 has sometimes refused to recognize the right of embassy officials to act on behalf
 of "dual nationals" or even to receive information concerning their arrest and im-
 prisonment. Dual nationals also complain of harassment from immigration inspec-
 tors.
 The law encourages voluntary repatriation of Moroccan Jews who have emigrated.
 Jewish emigres with Israeli citizenship freely visit Morocco. The Government also
 encourages the return of Saharans who departed Morocco due to the conflict in the
 Western Sahara-provided they recognize the Government's claim to the region. The
 Government does not permit Saharan nationalists who have been released from
 prison to live in the disputed territory.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change their Govern-
 ment
 Practically speaking, the citizens do not enjoy the right to change their govern-
 ment by democratic means. The King, as Head of State, appoints the Prime Min-
 ister, who is the titular head of government. The Parliament has the theoretical au-
 thority to effect change in the system of government, but has never exercised it. The
 Constitution may not be amended without the Kings approval. The Ministry of Inte-
 rior appoints provincial governors and local caids. The latter undergo a 2-year train-
 ing course in the Ministry's "Ecole de Formation de Cadres." Municipal councils are
 elected bodies.
 Constitutional changes in 1992 authorized the Prime Minister to nominate other
 government ministers, but the King retains the right to replace any minister at will.
 ny significant surrender of power from the Crown to the Prime Minister's office
 was further obviated when the King decreed to the secretaries general, who serve
 at the King's pleasure, many of the powers previously vested in the ministers.
 Allegations of fraud and manipulation in the 1993 parliamentary election are
 pending before the Constitutional Council, the designated body adjudicating the dis-
 putes. Challenges have been filed for more than 100 of the 333 seats in Parliament.
 Although 17 reelections have been ordered and carried out, often with new credible
 allegations of irregularity, human rights groups do not expect the Council to adju-
 dicate the remaining cases.
 Sixteen parties have members in Parliament. In a rare display of political inde-
 pendence, a coalition of major parties refused in 1994 to accept the King's invitation
 to  accept ministerial posts-absent significant political and     electoral re-
 form,including control of the Ministry of Interior. As a consequence, most present
 ministers are technocrats named by the King as caretakers pending the formation
 of a longer-term government. In 1994 the Parliament authorized the televised
 broadcasts of ministerial question periods in Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are three officially recognized nongovernmental human rights groups: the
 Moroccan Human Rights Organization (OMDH), the Moroccan Lea         or the De-
 fense of Human Rights (LMDH), and the Moroccan Human Rights Association
 (AMDH). LMDH is associated with the Istiqlal Party, and AMDH is associated with
 the Party of the Socialist Avant Garde. They have formed a coordinating committee
 and generally issue joint communiques. OMDH is nonpartisan. LMDH and OMDH
 participate in some activities of the Royal Consultative Council on Human Rights.
 In January OMDH issued a communique stating that the Ministry of Justice had
 formed a partnership with OMDH, AMDH, and LMDH to investigate alleged viola-
 
 
 1151
 tions of human rights. However, at year's end, there had been no significant follow-
 up on this initiative. While the Ministry of Justice held occasional meetings with
 the NGO's, the Ministry of Interior continued to refuse to acknowledge their inquir-
 ies directly.
 In comments before Parliament in February, reiterated in November, the Minister
 of Interior made clear that he resented inquiries from human rights groups and that
 neither of the two ministries would respond to them, even if such inquires came
 from Parliament or other ministries.
 The Royal Consultative Council on Human Rights (CCDH), an advisory body to
 the King, exists in sometimes uneasy coordination with the Deputy Ministry of
 Human Rights (DMHR), which was established by Parliament. While their common
 missions often provoked an adversarial relationship, a clearer division of labor
 emersed in 1994. CCDH has concentrated on the reports written by its various
 working groups, most notably its recommendations for prison reform. DMHR's ac-
 tivities have been more executive: identifying Tazmamart Prison victims for com-
 pensation and studying the dossiers of disappeared persons for possible compensa-
 tion to their families. The two bodies worked together on the royal amnesty pro-
 gram: CCDH formulated the criteria for eligibility, and DMHR compiled a list of po-
 tentially eligible prisoners.
 Amnesty International (AI) established an office in Casablanca after its represent-
 atives visited Morocco in 1994. While citing a continuation of human rights abuses,
 AI commended the Government's openness in affording access to prisons and pris-
 oners.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Women suffer various forms of legal and cultural discrimination. Under
 the Criminal Code, women are generally accorded the same treatment as men, but
 are not accorded equal treatment under family and estate law, which is based on
 the Malikite school of Islamic law. Under this law, husbands may more easily di-
 vorce their wives than vice versa. Women inherit only half as much as male heirs.
 Moreover, even where the law guarantees equal status, cultural norms often prevent
 a woman's exercise of those rights. When a woman inherits property, for example,
 male relatives may pressure her to relinquish her interest.
 The civil law status of women is governed by the Moudouwana, or Code of Per-
 sonal Status, which is based in part on the Koran. With the active support of the
 King, limited reforms of the Moudouwana, consistent with the Koran, were effected
 in 1993. The amendments allow a wife to divorce a husband who announces an in-
 tent to take a second wife; grant a wife unspecified allowance rights, based on the
 husband's income, in cases where a husband files for divorce without legal justifica-
 tion; and recognize a wife's priority of right to custody of young children alter a di-
 vorce.
 Women's groups unsuccessfully requested that the Moudouwana changes include
 expanded rights to combat spousal violence, a problem human rights groups confirm
 is commonplace. Although a battered wife has the right to complain to the police,
 as a practical matter she would do so only if prepared to iMie for divorce. Spousal
 abuse is grounds for divorce, but even if abuse is proven, divorced women o not
 have the right to financial support from their former spouses. Hence few victims re-
 port abuse to authorities.
 The law and social practice concerning violence against women reflects the impor-
 tance society places on the honor of the family. The Criminal Code includes severe
 punishment for men convicted of rape or violating a woman or girl. The defendants
 in such cases bear the burden of proving their innocence. However, sexual assaults
 often go unreported because of the stigma attached to the loss of virginity. A rapist
 may be offered the opportunity to marry his victim in order to preserve the honor
 of the victim's family. The law excuses the murder or injury of a wife caught in the
 act of committing adultery;, however, a woman would not be excused for killing her
 husband under the same circumstances.
 While many well-educated women pursue careers in law, medicine, education, and
 government service, few make it to the top echelons of their professions. Women
 comprise approximately 24 percent of the work force, with the majority of them in
 the industrial service, and teaching sectors.
 Women suffer most from inequality in the rural areas. Rural women perform most
 hard physical labor, the rate of literacy, particularly in the countryside, is noticeably
 lower for women than for men. Girls are much less likely to be sent to school than
 are boys. Women who earn secondary school diplomas, however, have equal access
 to university training.
 
 
 1152
 Children.-The Government has taken little action to end child labor (see Section
 6.d.). Young girls in particular are exploited as domestic servants. Orphanages are
 often party to the practice of adoptive servitude, in which families adopt young girls
 who perform the duties of domestic servants in their new families. Credible reports
 of physical abuse are widespread. The practice is often justified as a better alter-
 native to keeping the girls in orphanages. It is ingrained in society, attracts little
 criticism, even from human rights groups, and is unregulated by the Government.
 In 1994 the Government continued a campaign to vaccinate children against pre-
 ventable diseases.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Constitution affirms, and the Govern-
 ment respects, the legal equality of all citizens.
 The official language is Arabic. The languages of instruction and the news media
 are both Arabic and French. Science and technical curriculums are taught in
 French, thereby eliminating the large monolingual Arabic-speaking population from
 these programs. Educational reforms in the past decade have stressed use of Arabic
 in secondary schools. Failure to similarly transform the university system has func-
 tionally disqualified many students, especially those from  poorer homes where
 French tutoring is not practicable, from higher education in lucrative fields.
 Some 60 percent of the population claim Berber heritage. Berber cultural groups
 contend that the three remaining Berber languages and Berber traditions are rap-
 idly being lost. Their repeated requests to the palace to permit the teaching of Ber-
 ber languages in the schools have finally produced a royal decree to effect the nec-
 essary curriculum changes. The King ordered the limited broadcast of Berber-lan-
 guage news programs on radio and television; the broadcasts commenced in 1994.
 However, the Government convicted Berber activists and canceled two conferences
 on Berber culture (see Section 1.c. and 1.f.). The moves suggest that the Govern-
 ment regards the Berber revival as a threat to state security.
 People With Disabilities.-Morocco has a high incidence of disabling disease. Polio
 is especially prevalent. While the Government contends that it seeks to integrate
 the disabled into society, most special education activities are provided by private
 charities and are generally affordable only to families with private means. Disabled
 persons typically survive by begging. In 1994 the Government continued a pilot
 training program for the blind, sponsored in part by a member of the royal family.
 There are no laws mandating physical changes to buildings to facilitate access for
 the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Although workers are free to establish and join trade
 unions, the unions themselves are not completely free from government interference.
 Perhaps a half million of Morocco's 9 million workers are unionized in 17 trade
 union federations. Three federations dominate the scene: the Union Marocain de
 Travail (UMT) the Confederation Democratique de Travail (CDT) and the Union
 Generale des Travailleurs Marocains (UGTM). The UMT has no political affiliation,
 but the CDT is linked to the Socialist Union of Popular Forces, and the UGTM to
 the Istiqlal Party. Unions belong to regional labor organizations and maintain ties
 with international trade secretariats.
 In practice, the internal intelligence services of the Ministry of Interior are be-
 lieved to have informants within the unions who monitor their activities and the
 election of officers. Sometimes union officers are subject to government pressure.
 Union leadership does not always uphold the rights of members to select their own
 leaders. There has been no case of the rank and file voting out its current leadership
 and replacing it with another.
 Workers have the right to strike and do so. In February the CDT called a 1-day
 general strike to protest government social policies. However, it quickly postponed
 the strike indefintely after the Prime Minister moved to ban it on grounds that
 there is no legislation implementing the constitutional provision for the right to
 strike. The Government maintained that since legal strikes are not defined by law,
 the CDTs general strike was outside the scope of legitimate union activity and
 hence illegal. Critics countered that the ban was an infringement of the Constitu-
 tion.
 During the May 1 Labor Day celebrations, 12 union members around the country
 were arrested for shouting political slogans. Three were convicted and imprisoned.
 They were released from prison in the general amnesty in July.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiuey.-The right to organize and
 bargain collectively is implied in the constitutional provisions on the right to strike
 and the right to join organizations. The many trade union federations compete to
 organize workers. Any group of eight workers may organize a union and a worker
 
 
 1153
 may change union affiliation easily. A work site may contain several independent
 locals or locals affiliated with more than one labor federation.
 In general, the Government ensures the observance of labor laws in larger compa-
 nies and in the public sector. In the informal economy, and in the textile and handi-
 crafts industries, labor laws and regulations are routinely ignored by the Govern-
 ment and management. As a practical matter, unions have no judicial recourse to
 oblige the Government to enforce labor laws and regulations.
 The laws governing collective bargaining are inadequate. Collective bargaining
 has been a long-established tradition in some parts of the economy, but the practice
 is not spreading. Wages and conditions of employment are generally set in discus-
 sions between employer and worker representatives. Employers unilaterally set
 wages for the majority of workers.
 Employer wishing to dismiss workers are required by law to notify the provincial
 governor through the labor inspector's office. In cases where employers plan to re-
 place dismissed workers, a government labor insp ector provides replacements and
 mediates the cases of workers who protest their dismissal. Any worker dismissed
 for committing a serious infraction of work rules is entitled by law to a court hear-
 in here is no law specifically prohibiting antiunion discrimination. Employers com-
 monly dismiss workers for union activities regarded as threatening to employer in-
 terests. The courts sometimes order the reinstatement of such workers, but are un-
 able to ensure that employers pay damages and back pay.
 Ministry of Labor inspectors serve as investigators and conciliators in labor dis-
 putes, but they are few in number and do not have the resources to investigate all
 cases. Unions have increasingly resorted to litigation to resolve labor disputes. In
 1994 the International Labor Organization (ILO) again cited the Government for
 failing to respond adequately to such abuses as the dismissals and arrests of trade
 unionists and the prohibition on union demonstrations.
 The Labor Law applies equally to the small Tangier export zone. The proportion
 of unionized workers in the export zone is about the same as in the rest of the econ-
 omy.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by ILO Convention 29, which was adopted by royal decree.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Abuse of the child labor laws is
 common nationwide. The law prohibits the employment or apprenticeship of any
 child under 12 years of age. Education is compulsory for children between the ages
 of 7 and 13. Special regulations govern the employment of children between the ages
 of 12 and 16. in practice, children are often apprenticed before age 12, particularly
 in the handicraft industry. The use of minors is common in the rug-making industry
 and also exists to some extent in the textile and leather goods industries. Children
 are also employed informally as domestics and usually receive little or no wages.
 Safety and health conditions as well as salaries in enterprises employing children
 are often substandard.
 Ministry of Labor inspectors are responsible for enforcing child labor regulations
 which are generally well observed in the industrialized, unionized sector of the econ-
 omy. However, the inspectors are not authorized to monitor the conditions of domes-
 tic servants.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage does not provide a decent
 standard of living for a worker and his family-even with government subsidies for
 food, diesel fuel, and public transportation subsidies. In many cases, several family
 members combine their income to support the family. The minimum wage was
 raised by 10 percent on July 1 to about $167 (1,510 dirhams) a month, the first in-
 crease in 2 years. Labor unions call for a minimum monthly wage of about $220
 to $230.
 The minimum wage is not enforced effectively in the informal and handicraft sec-
 tors of the economy, and even the Government pays less than the minimum wage
 to workers at the lowest civil service grades. To increase employment opportunities
 for recent graduates, the Government allows firms to hire them for a limited period
 for less than the minimum wage. Most workers in the industrial sector earn more
 than the minimum wage. They are generally paid between 13 and 16 months' sal-
 ary, including bonuses, each year.
 The law provides a 48-hour maximum workweek with not more than 10 hours any
 single day, premium pay for overtime, paid public and annual holidays, and mini-
 mum conditions for health and safety, including the prohibition of night work for
 women and minors. As with other regulations and laws, these are not universally
 observed in the informal sector.
 Occupational health and safety standards are rudimentary, except for a prohibi-
 tion on the employment of women in certain dangerous occupations. Labor inspec-
 
 
 1154
 tors endeavor to monitor working conditions and accidents, but lack sufficient re-
 sources. In 1994 five teenaged workers were paralyzed by glue fumes in a poorly
 ventilated shoe workshop.
