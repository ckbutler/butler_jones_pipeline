 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 A member of the British Commonwealth, Antigua and Barbuda
 celebrated its sixth anniversary of independence from the
 United Kingdom on November 1, 1987. Respect for Human rights
 in Antigua and Barbuda is grounded in its domestic law and
 reinforced by the democratic political values and traditions
 that evolved before independence and which continue to develop.
 Its population supports these values and expresses dissent
 openly, aided by a free press. The Constitution provides for
 a parliamentary system of-government based on majority rule
 and requires general elections at least every 5 years.
 Security forces consist of a police force, a coast guard, and
 the Antigua and Barbuda Defence Force, a 120-man infantry unit.
 The police are organized, trained, and managed according to
 British law enforcement practices. The security forces have a
 good reputation for respecting individual rights in the
 performance of their duties.
 Antigua and Barbuda's good human rights record was largely
 unchanged in 1987.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances or politically
 motivated abductions.
 c. Torture-and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other forms of cruel or
 inhuman treatment of prisoners or detainees. The Government
 respects these prohibitions in practice. Prison conditions
 are adequate, and the authorities permit regular visits by a
 prisoner-'s family and attorney as well as by members of the
 clergy.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention,
 which do not occur in practice. Criminal defendants are
 guaranteed the right to a judicial determination of the
 legality of their detention, and detainees must be brought
 before a court within 48 hours of arrest or'detention.
 There were no reports of cases of involuntary exile.
 The Constitution prohibits forced or compulsory labor, and
 there were no reports of such practices in Antigua and Barbuda.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Criminal defendants are assured a fair, open, and public
 trial. The independent judiciary is widely respected for its
 impartiality and professionalism. The Governmeat provides for

 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 legal assistance at public expense to persons without means to
 retain a private attorney. There are no political prisoners
 in Antigua and Barbuda.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no reports of arbitrary police or government
 actions against a person's home, family, or privacy. The
 police must obtain a warrant before searching private premises.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of speech, the
 press, and other forms of communication, in practice the
 Government dominates the electronic media, which is the only
 source of daily news. Opposition politicians have not been
 able to obtain air time to present their positions. ABS Radio
 and Television report regularly on the activities of the
 ruling Antigua Labour Party but rarely report on the
 opposition. Criticism of the Government appearing in wire
 service regional reports is not aired in Antigua.
 A different situation exists in the nation's print media.
 Weekly newspapers representing the opposition publish a
 variety of opinions. They are free to criticize the
 Government and dq so regularly. Religious organizations also
 publish their own newspapers.
 b. Freedom of-Pe~ceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution assures the right of peaceful assembly.
 Public meetings and organized demonstrations are held without
 police interference. Permits for public meetings are necessary
 but are granted routinely.
 Less than a majority of Antigua and Barbuda's workers belong
 to unions, but labor organizations are free to organize and
 bargain collectively. The hotel industry in Antigua and
 Barbuda, for example, is heavily unionized. The right to
 strike is recognized by the Labour Code. This right can be
 limited if the Court of Industrial Relations becomes involved
 in a given dispute. Once the Court has been requested by
 either party to mediate the dispute, there can be no strike
 while the Court is formulating a decision. Because of the
 delays associated with this process, in practice labor disputes
 are often worked out before a strike is called. There has
 been one strike in the past 2 years.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international labor
 organizations and do so in practice. Antigua and Barbuda has
 two major trade unions: the Antigua Trade and Labour Union
 (ATLU) and the Antigua Workers' Union. The ATLU is associated
 with the ruling Antigua Labour Party, while the AWU is allied
 with the opposition United National Democratic Party. During
 1987 the ATLU did not hesitate to criticize government
 policies and practices with which it disagreed.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is free exercise of religious beliefs. The population
 is overwhelmingly Protestant, but adherents of other religious
 denominations proselytize openly without stigma or government

 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 interference. All groups are free to maintain links with
 coreligionists in other countries.
 d. Freedom df Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Neither law nor practice restricts the right of citizens of
 Antigua and Barbuda to move about within the country, to
 travel-abroad, or to emigrate.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their-Government
 Antigua and Barbuda has a multiparty political system which
 accommodates widely divergent views. All citizens 18 years of
 age and older may register and vote. Individual parties
 conduct voter registration drives free from government
 interference. The Government is obligated by law .to hold
 voter registration during a fixed period each year.
 Prime Minister V. C. Bird Sr.'s Antigua Labour Party (ALP) won
 an overwhelming victory in the April 1984 elections, taking
 every constituency in Antigua. In Barbuda, an independent won
 the sole seat and became the Government's only parliamentary
 opposition. Despite the lopsided ALP victory, the elections
 were fair-and open.
 The opposition energetically attacks the Bird government,
 particularly on the issue of alleged government corruption.
 On the smaller island of Barbuda, which has less than
 2 percent of the country's total population, separatist
 sentimenfs remain strong.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Internationally recognized human rights organizations have not
 expressed concern about Antigua and Barbuda. There were no
 requests for investigations or inquiries into alleged
 violations in 1987. The Government is sensitive to human
 rights issues and has condemned abuses elsewhere.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Law and practice prohibit discrimination based on race, sex,
 creed, language, or social status. The role of women in
 society is not restricted by law, but tradition tends to limit
 women to home and family, particularly in rural areas. As
 elsewhere in the region, these traditional roles are changing.
 The Government has begun programs to provide enhanced
 educational opportunities for both sexes as well as family
 planning services. Under the energetic prodding of the
 Government's "Women's Desk," women are moving up in government
 and the professions, but more slowly in the private sector.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The legal minimum working age is 13, a regulation which is
 respected. The workweek is 40 hours in 5 days, and workers
 are guaranteed a minimum of 3 weeks' annual leave. There are
 no occupational health and safety laws or regulations, but the
 Labour Code provides general health and safety guidelines.
 Opposition labor unions have said that enforcement of these
 
 
 370
 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 guidelines by the Labour Ministry is weak due to a shortage of
 personnel. A series of minimum wages for different categories
 of employment was established in 1981, but labor unions have
 argued that the wage levels are too low. These various
 minimum wages are currently being reviewed by the Government.
