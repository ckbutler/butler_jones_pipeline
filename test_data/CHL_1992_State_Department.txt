CHULE
 Chile reestablished democratic government after more than 16 years of military
 rule with the inauguration of President Patriclo Aylwin on March 11, 1990. Under
 the Aylwin Government, Chile held nationwide municipal elections on June 28,
 1992-the first in more than 20 years. The Congress is an active and independent
 legislative body, comprising 120 Deputies and 38 Senators elected in December
 1989. An additional nine Senators were a ppointed by the outgoing military govern-
 ment, depriving the Aylwin Government of a majority in the Senate. There is a sep
 
 
 353
 arate, constitutionally independent judicial branch, which is largely dominated by
 appointees of the former military regime.
 Civilian control of the military is increasing but not complete; the armed forces
 remain largely autonomous institutions, and the civilian Government lacks the au-
 thority to remove military personnel from duty. The Minister of Defense is a civilian
 appointed by the President and responsible for oversight of the military. General
 Auguste Pinochet, leader and the only member of the 1973 Junta still on active
 duty, remained as Commander-in-Chief of the Army after the transition to civilian
 government, a position he ma, hold until March 1998 under a constitutional provi-
 sion approved during the military regime. According to the US. Arms Control and
 Disarmament Agency, total military expenditures for 1989 were $790 million. There
 are no plans to reduce these expenditures in the near future.
 The Carabineros, Chile's uniformed national police, have primary responsibility
 for public order and safety, crime control, and border security. The Investigations
 Police are responsible for controlling and investigating serious crime. Both police or-
 ganizations, although formally under the administrative jurisdiction of the "Ministry
 of Defense, which determines their budget, fall under the operational control of the
 Ministry of the Interior. Elements of the police again were responsible for human
 rights abuses, including torture and other mistreatment of detainees, and were often
 unwilling to cooperate in mivestiations of past abuses by the military and the Co
 lice. The Investigations Police did much to advance the investigations in a numer
 of high-profile human rights cases.
 Chile s free market economy, well Into its ninth consecutive year of expansion, re-
 flected boom conditions. Growth in 1992 projected at 8 percent, was led by exports
 and investments. Unemployment rates hovered near 20-year lows, while inflation
 continued to decline, at least through the first half of 1992. Copper is Chile's most
 important source of foreign exchange, followed by fresh fruit and-fish meal.
 Chile's overall human rights record has improved significantly in recent years.
 The most pressing human rights problems in 1992 continued to be the need to ad-
 dress past human rights violations committed (largely with impunity) during the
 military regime; terrorist violence; and incidents of torture by the police, who are
 seldom tried and punished for such acts. Intimidation of the press through law
 suits, particularly in military tribunals, threatened freedom of the press in 1992.
 Other areas of human rights abuse included arbitrary arrest and detention, contin-
 ued strong partiality towards the military by the courts, and discrimination and vio-
 lence against women.
 A January law provided reparations for more than 2 000 families of those who dis-
 appeared or werekilled during the Pinochet regime. Te law established a new gov-
 ernment office to administer the compensation program and investigate the fate of
 those still missing. Arrests were made in a few high-profile human rights cases dat-
 ing back to the time of the military government.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Political and other extrajudicial
 killings in 1992 were largely the result of terrorist action. Two terrorist organiza-
 tions, the dissident wing of the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front (FPMR/D) and the
 Lautaro Youth Movement (MJL) were responsible for most of the political violence.
 For example, on April 29, the MJL murdered Domingo Sarmiento, an active member
 of the Party for Democracy (PPD) who had abandoned armed resistance and entered
 mainstream politics. The police arrested suspects in the murder.
 Chilean terrorists killed six police in confrontations during the year, in a carefully
 planned assault on September 10, the MJL ambushed three Investigations Police of-
 ficers while they were guarding the residence of a public official. By year's end the
 police had conducted an extensive investigation into these killings and had detained
 a number of suspects. The police killed a total of six suspected terrorists in armed
 clashes as of September 16. In an effort to better coordinate the nation's effort
 against crime and terrorism, the Government sent legislation to Congress, which is
 expected to be approved in early 1993, to create a new Office for Public Security
 and Information.
 In January the Congress approved a new law to compensate the families of vic-
 tims of politically motivated disappearances and murders during the 1973 to 1990
 period of military rule. The Congress based this legislation on recommendations
 made in 1991 by the presidentially appointed National Commission on Truth and
 Reconciliation, or "Rettig Commission. The compensation package included fiman-
 cial reparation and health care services for the victims' immediate families and
 schooling for the victims' children. The law also established the National Corpora-
 
 
 tion for Reparation and Reconciliation to determine the fate and location of more
 than 1,000 missing Chileans, to complete investigations of mere than 600 cases on
 which the Rettig Commission did not reach a conclusion, and to review new cases
 not previou sly presented to the Commission.
 The 1978 Amnesty Law impedes the prosecution of those responsible for human
 rights abuses committed during the military government between 1973 and 1978.
 The Government's interpretation of the Amnesty Law would have the courts deter-
 mine guilt before app  ng the amnesty. In practice, however, military tribunals and
 the Supreme Court frequently used the Amnesty Law to close investigations of
 human rights abuses allegedly committed by members of the security forces before
 the facts and criminal responsibility had been established. The security forces were
 also uncooperative in furnishing information to resolve disappearance cases or locate
 remains of the missing. Moreover, even when the Amnesty Law does not apply and
 is not used to close investigations before trial, military personnel rarely have been
 convicted for human rights abuses. To prevent further investigation, military tribu-
 nals seek jurisdiction n cases "in which active duty military officials are charged
 with committing crimes against civilians, including instances when human rights
 abuses are alleged. When there is a conflict concerning jurisdiction, the Supreme
 Court has sided more often with military tribunals than with civilian courts. These
 decisions produced considerable criticism and charges that Chile's highest Court, be.
 cause of its perceived lack of impartiality, impedes justice for victims of human
 rights abuses committed by the security forces.
 A number of arrests were made in 1992 in a few high-profile human rights viola-
 tions committed by members of the security forces during the military regime. These
 included the 1982 murder of labor leader Tucapel Jimenez and the 1985 throat
 slashing of three Communist Party members. A former military officer indicted in
 the Tucapel Jimenez murder was arrested in Argentina and awaits extradition.
 Alvaro C6rbalan was arrested for a murder connected with the assassination of Ji-
 menez. Corbalan, a former head of operations for a now disbanded unit of the na-
 tion  te   gnc    apparatus called the Center for National Information (CND, is
 want ed S questioning regarding a series of other human rights violations commit-
 ted during his tenure at CNI. Special investigating Judge Milton Juice, who re-
 ceived several death threats, ordered the detention of nearly two dozen former
 Carabineros, including former Junta member and Carabinem Director General
 Cesar Mendnsa, for the kidnaping and murder of the three Communists. In Novem-
 ber the Supreme Court handed down a controversial decision in which it unani-
 mously overturned an indictment which charged Mendoza with withholding evi-
 den c. The Court absolved him of any wrngdoing.
 The new reparations office, which does not have subpoena or posecutory powers,
 provided a spcial investigating judge with evidence regarding more than 70 dis-
 appearances allegedly involving a former Secret Police (DINA) interrogator, Osvaldo
 Rome Mna. He fled to Brazi using falsified documents in 1975. In November the
 Brazilian government expelled him to Chile. He was compelled to testify about
 human rights violations committed during the early years of the military govern-
 meat. The Supreme Court granted the military courts jurisdiction over the inves-
 tigation of the 1974 disappearance case of Movement of the Revolutionary Left
 (MI) leader Alfonso Chanfrean, in whose a p prehension Rmo allegedly partici-
 pated. The decision was widely criticized as effectively ending serious investigation
 of the case and as a potentially damaging precedent for other unresolved disappear-
 ances.
 The Chilean Government continued to show a strong commitment to bringing to
 justice retired General Manuel Contreras and Colonel Pedro Espinoza-respectively
 former Director and Operations Chief of DINA-in connection with the 1976 mur-
 ders in Washington, D C  of former Chilean official Orlando Letelier and his US.
 associate, Ronni Moffitt. The special judge closed the investigative phase of the case
 in November, formally accusing the suspected "intellectual authors" of the assas-
 sinations, who had been released on bail in December 1991, of ordering the mur-
 ders. In a related action, in .April the Chilean Government paid $2.6 milion dollars
 in cx gratia compensation to the LAtelier and Moffitt families as determined by a
 special commission established by the US. and Chilean Governments.
 The Supreme Court has not yet ruled on a 1991 appeal by Carmen Gloria Quin-
 tand, who was seriously burned in a confrontation with a military patrol in 1986,
 and by the family of Rodrigo Rojas, who died of burns resulting from the same con-
 frontation. A military appeals court had overturned a serious injury finding by a
 lower military tribunal, disregarding considerable evidence available to it that dem-
 onstrated military personnel were responsible.
 In a rare decision involving human rights abuses against members of Chile's in-
 digenous population during the military regime, the Appeals Court of Temuco or-
 
 
 355
 dered the detention in December 1991 of two former Carabineros and one civilian
 suspected in the abduction of two Mapuche indians in 1974. As of October 30, the
 Supreme Court was considering an appeal by the accused.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no cases of disappearances or kidnapigs during
 1992, and lice resolved one earlier politically motivated abduction. In Setember
 1991, the FPM'R/D kidnaped Cristian Edwards, son of the owner of El Mercurio
 newspaper and released him in February 1992 following receipt of a large ransom
 payment. fnvestigations Police detectives arrested five of his captors in March but
 have yet to capture the intellectual authors of the abduction. The five in custody
 were found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment; one was killed while partici-
 pating in an October jail break. Another of the arrested kidnapers is also suspected
 of involvement in the 1991 assassination of rightist Senator Jaime Guzman and
 other high-profile terrorist murders.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhunuo, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution forbids 'the use of illegal pressure," human rights groups
 continued to receive credible reports of mistreatment and torture by some
 Carabinero and Investigations Police units in 1992. The Defense Committee of the
 Peoples' Rights (CODE      reported 48 instances of torture or cruel treatment as
 of October 30, most committed by the Carabineros' Third Command in Santiago,
 which includes the Counterterrorism and Intelligence units known jointly as
 DIPOLCAR. Many of these cases included credible complaints of mistreatment and
 torture, including sleefoo dp and water deprivation, threats, bea tn s, and forced
 standing for long periods of time. Two complaints against Investigations Police in-
 volved the use o electric shock.
 Judicial investigations of torture have seldom been concluded, due in lare part
 to the refusal of some state security organizations to comply with court orders to
 make security agent available to the corts for questioning. !he reluctance of mem-
 bers of the judiciary, many of them appointed by the military regime, to take an
 interest in the issue has contributed, at least in part, to the failure of police to in-
 vestigate and prosecute cases of torture and other mistreatment. The government,
 which has denounced the use of torture and encouraged Chileans to report such in-
 cidents, has not been effective in eradicating the practice.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Eile-Under Article 19 f the Constitution, ci-
 vilian and military courts ma order a suspect's arrest and detention for up to 5
 days without ariment and extend the detention for up to 10 days for suspected
 terrorist acts. By law, detainees are to be provided 30 minutes of immediate and
 daily access to a lawyer (although not in private) and to a doctor to ve rify their
 physical condition. The law does not permit a judge to deny such access. With few
 exceptions, this practice appears to hav been observed by the Investlations Police,
 but to a lesser extent by the Carabinerov In politically motivated crimes or cases
 of suspected terrorism, some judges have denied detainees access to lawyers and
 doctors. There were also instances when detainees were held incommunicado for pe-
 riods beyond the 10 days, particularly when more than one charge was pending
 against them.
 The Chilean Human Rights Commission reported 44 arbitrary arrests through
 September 1992. Many of-thos detained were never charged and were released
 after several days. Though most cases related to the anti-terrorist law were trans-
 ferred to civilian courts i 1991, military prosecutors continue to hold open inves-
 tigations of two cases: the discovery of arms caches in 1986 and the 1986 assault
 on a bakery in which a Carabinero officer wa killed.
 There were no cases of forced exile in 1992, but some Chileans convicted of politi-
 cally motivated crimes during the military regime opted to go abroad an a condition
 of their release from jail in 1992.
 e. Denial of Fair Publi lral.-Although the judiciary is legally independent. 12
 of the 17 Supreme Court Judgs were appointed by the former military regmue, and
 the Court in often partial de ions  nvoelving miitary personnel (see Section 1.a.).
 Trial in criminal canes is not by jury. Reliance Is on the written record rather than
 oral testimony, and the jude renders a verdict after directing the investigation. The
 investigation ehase is considered secret, with limited access for the accused or his
 attorney to eidence or testimony which han been accumulated b the udge. There
 isa well-developedi, multistage a ppeal p~ecss leading ultimately to the S.upreme
 Court. This lengthy prces is criticized for the slowness with whch ecisons are
 rendered; it is not uncommon for cases to linger in the court system for several
 years.
 Under the military government a broad interpretation of state securitynlaws
 greatly expanded the grisdiction of military courts over the prosecution of pro-
 scribed political activities. A 1991 legal reform package limited the jurisdiction of
 
 
 military tribunals and transferred most cases to the civilian courts. There still re-
 mains a backlog of such cases in the civilian judicial sstem.
 As of November 20, President A 1win      ted pardns n 1992 to 19 individuals
 who had been convicted of politically motivated crimes committed during the mili-
 tary regime. As of that date, the Social Aid Foundation of the Christian Churches
 ported that 23 persons charged with violating state security laws before
 March 11 1990, remained in jail. Most of the remaining prisoners were involved in
 some of Chile's more notorious terrorist incidents, some of which caused fatalities,
 as in the death of five bodyguards in the 1986 assassination attempt against then
 President Pinochet. The jailed inividuals were charged with multiple offenses; most
 of them were subjected to years of incarceration and torture during the military re-
 ime and will most likely remain in prison until their eases are resolved b the -
 diilsystem. When such cases were resolved in the psst, President Aylin re-
 quentlypardoned those involved.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privac, Family. Home. or Correspondence.-
 Searches of the home and interception or private communications are prohibited by
 the Constitution unless either a civilian or a militar ourt issues a search warrant
 for specific locations. Congress passed a law in 1991 that allows the police to enter
 a lcation without a warrant if they have good reason to believe perpetrators of a
 crime areahiding there. The 1984 anti-terrorist law provides for surveillance of those
 suspected of terrorist crimes, and for the interception opening, or recording of pri-
 vate communications and documents in such cases. Political espionage-including
 the interception and recording of private telephone conversations attributed to ei-
 ther the Investigations Police or Army Intelligence--produced three separate scan-
 dals, one of which led to the resignation of the Investigations Police Director Gen-
 eral in March.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution recognizes freedom of speech
 and press and these rights generally are respected in practice. A threat to freedom
 of expression during 1992 was what the media interpreted as excessive use of the
 judicial prerogative, in either civil or criminal cases, to prohibit publication of any
 aspects surrounding a lawsuit in process. Once a judge orders such a prohibition,
 the media practice is-to observe it. The Inter-American Press Association (IAPA),
 at its March 1992 meeting, expressed concern that the habitual use of this practice
 in Chile would constitute an impediment to freedom of the press.
 During 1992 military courts heard several new cases of espionage and sedition
 brought against journalists. Most of these cases are still in the investigation stage;
 however, in one instance the Director and the Information Chief of the weekly El
 Siglo were jailed overnight before being released on bail. In November the IAPA
 president visited Chile to express concern that such suits could threaten freedom
 of the press. The judiciary has also shown itself extremely sensitive to media criti-
 cism. In November the Supreme Court brought charges against the conservative and
 influential daily El Mercurio for an editorial criticizing corruption in the judiciary,
 an editorial considered defamatry by the Supreme Court.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Citizens have the right to
 peaceful assembly and association. Although official permission to hold rallies is not
 technically required, authorities must be notified in writing of planned public
 events. Human rights groups chalged that the police often used excessive force to
 break up demonstrations, including tear gas and water cannons, particularly
 against leftist protesters. For example, during a September march, Carabineros
 fired tear gas into apeaceful crowd of men, women, and children gathered on a nar-
 row street, potentially creating a dangerous stampede. Organizers had notified the
 authorities as required by law. The Carabineros were reacting to an attempt by
 some individuals, several blocks away from the crowd, to extinguish the "liberty
 flame," which commemorates servicemen who died during the 1973 coup d'etat. The
 Government acknowledged that the police acted hastily.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion. Chile
 is predominantly Roman Catholic. Other denominations practicetheir faiths without
 restrictions. The Mormon Church continued to be a target of leftwing terrorist
 groups, primarily the MJL, apparently for political rather than religious reasons.
 d Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Chileans by law are free to move within and to enter and leave their
 country. The National Office of Returnees--established by the Congress in 1990 to
 facilitate the reincorporation into Chilean society of the approximately 25,000 Chil-
 eans who have returned from exile-has assisted more than 13,000 exiles and their
 families by providing special access to health care, housing, and information on job
 opportunities.
 
 
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern.
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government through periodic elections.
 There is universal suffrage for citizens 18 years of age or over, and more than 95
 percent of those eligible are registered to vote. In June, for the first time in more
 than 20 years, Chile held municipal elections. Voter turnout was the highest ever
 for local elections. Women are active in Chilean political life, especially at the grass-
 roots political party level, but there are few women in leadership positions; women
 co prse less than 6 percent of the members of Congress.
 The military regime designed certain provisions of the 1980 Constitution to pro-
 tect its interests and those of its conservative backers during the transition to civil-
 ian rule. For example, nine Senators were appointed by the outging government
 to take office with the 38 elected Senators, effectively depriving the elected Aylwin
 Government of a majority in the Senate; this in turn stymied efforts by the Govern-
 ment to pass certain constitutional reforms. One appointed Senator died in Decem-
 ber 1990, and the Government chose not to fill his vacant seat.
 Chile's indigenous people are able to artici ate freely in the political process. Al-
 though relatively few members of Chile's Indian population are politically active,
 their participation has increased since the 1990 democratic transition. Of the esti-
 mat    half million Mapuche Indians in Chile, there is one representative of Indian
 descent in the Congress.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Catholic Church's Vicariate of Solidarity closed its offices on November 27.
 The Vicariate had taken the lead in defending human rights during the Pinochet
 regime and provided legal counsel to families of victims who were killed or dis-
 appeared between 1973 and 1990. FASIC hired many of the Vicariate's lawyers and
 assumed the bulk of the Vicariate's caseload. The Defense Committee of the Peoples'
 Rights (CODEPU) provides legal counsel to those currently accused of politically re-
 lated crimes and to victims of human rights abuses. The Chilean Government per-
 mits visits and investigations by private international human rights groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Government seeks to integrate the indigenous population, but the largest ra-
 cial minority, the Mapuche Indians in southern Chile, remains separated from the
 rest of society, largely because of historical, cultural, educational, and geographical
 factors.
 Human rights groups praised the resolution of a land dispute in early 1992 by
 the Government, whichqgreed to pay $6.15 million to buy from a private organiza-
 tion territory claimed by indigenous families in the Quinquen Valley. In June, how-
 ever, the Government was criticized for insensitivity and for overreacting to land
 seizures by more than 60 Mapuche Indians near Temuco. The Government began
 legal proceedings, detained the group's leader-later released on bail--and inves-
 tigated his organization's legal status and affiliations. The other participants remain
 under criminal investigation.
 Legal distinctions between the sexes still exist, despite a 1989 law which reduced
 restrictions on women. Inheritance laws provide strong protection for wives and pro-
 tect female offspring, and a 1992 law accords children born out of wedlock the same
 civil rights as offspring born in wedlock. The changes in law, however, have not
 been matched by a change in attitude by society police or the courts. In many
 cases, abuses such as wife-beating continue to be tolerated or ignored.
 The National Women's Service (SERNAM), whose Director became the first
 woman with cabinet rank, estimates that one in four Chilean women has been sub-
 jected to physical violence by her husband or partner, and only 16 percent of women
 report such violence to the police. From a 1992 survey in metropolitan Santiago,
 SERNAM learned that the level of violence was highest in the lower economic stra-
 ta, where 34 percent of women reported that they-had experienced physical abuse.
 SERNAM conducts courses on the legal, medical, and psychological aspects of do-
 mestic violence for Carabineros, who are most often the first public officials to inter-
 vene in such incidents. SERNAM also provides legal and medical information to
 abused women.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Private sector workers and employees of state-run
 enterpriseshave the right to join unions, and approximately 12 percent of the work
 force is organized. The Labor Code does not allow government employees to form
 trade unions, but their associations have legal status, and they participate in labor
 
 
 358
 confederations. These associations do not participate in collective bargaining. The
 police and military are not allowed to form employee associations.
 The Labor Code was amended in 1991 to allow for the formation of nationwide
 labor "centrals," but the requirements are so onerous that only one central has ob-
 tained legal recognition - the Unified Workers Central (CUT), which was the
 most broadly based. The Democratic Workers Central and the conservative Chilean
 Workers Central have not legalized their status and appear headed for extinction.
 Unions are independent of the Government, but they maintain ties to political par-
 ties. Only the Democratic Workers Central is politically independenti but it has suf-
 fered a decline in membership and power. Labor unions frely maintain relations
 with international labor bodies.
 The 1991 Labor Code reforms removed several significant restrictions to the right
 to strike, but required that a majority of employees must reject an employer's final
 offer in the presence of a labor inspector and vote by secret ballot for a strike. Em-
 ployers may no onger fire striking workers after 60 days without paying them sev-
 erance benefits (which have increased from a maximum of 5 to 11 months' salary).
 The reforms do not bring Chile into compliance with International Labor Organiza-
 tion (ILO) Conventions on freedom of association or the right to organize and bar-
 gain collectively, neither of which the Government has ratified. Even before passing
 the labor reforms, the Government restored the right to strike at copper mines and
 other entities which had previously been included on a list of strategic enterprises.
 In 1992, for example, the telephone company had a 2-week legal strike, and port
 workers held illegal work stoppages without suffering reprisals. See Section L.a. for
 details on the progress made m determining responsibility for the 1982 murder of
 labor leader Tucapel Jimenez.
 b. The Right to Orqanize and Bargain Collectivy.-The climate for collective bar-
 gaining improved with the passa$e of the new labor reforms, but the process is
 strictly regulated and employees in small firms face serious problems of antiunion
 discrimination. The entire collective bargaining process may be nullified if any of
 a series of legally imposed deadlines are missed by either the union or management.
 The Government unilaterally sets the wages of public employees without formal
 bargaining. The reformed Labor Code permits bargaining in the private sector and
 state enterprises and provides for inter company and sector wide negotiations, but
 only bakers have negotiated in this manner. Terms negotiated by temporary work-
 ers-defined as the merchant marine, port workers, construction workers, and art-
 ists-"do not have the legal status of labor contracts," according to the revised Labor
 Code.
 Employers may no longer dismiss workers without cause, but they use technical-
 ities in tle Labor Code to fire union leaders even when they enjoy legal protections.
 Reforms to the Labor Code provide that the employer must pay a 20-percent penalty
 to the worker if courts rule that he was fired without due cause, but they do not
 require that the worker be rehired. Employers are allowed to negotiate with ad hoc
 worker groups, which undermines the bargaining ability of the union.
 There are no export processing zones in Chile or other special districts where dif-
 ferent labor laws apply.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited in the Constitution and Labor Code, and there is no evidence that it is cur-
 rently practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.--Child labor is regulated by law.
 Children under 14 years old may be employed only with permission of parents or
 guardians, only after completing their compulsory elementary schooling, and only in
 restricted types of labor. Those aged _15 to 18 may be employed i a larger variety
 ofjob and at expanded hours, but only with their parents or guardians' permission.
 Labor inspectors enforce these regulations, and compliance is good in the formal sec-
 tor. Economic factors have forced many children to seek employment in the informal
 eonomy which, by definition, is more difficult to regulate. 'The Carabineros have in-
 stituted moble police stations to ounsel parents who force their children to work
 and have proposed creating.e Public Defender for Children's Rights.
 e. Acceptabie Conditions of Work.-Minimum wages, hours of work, and occupa-
 tional safety and health standards are regulated by law. The standard workweek
 is 48 hours. There is a minimum wage, and lower paid workers also receive a family
 subsidy which is designed to raise their earnings to an acceptable level. When a tri-
 partite committee comprising government, management, and labor representatives
 set the minimum wage in 1992, they based it on future projected inflation and in-
 creases in productivity. The Ministry of Labor has inspectors to enforce laws cover-
 ing wages and hours of work but despite recent increases in resources, enforcement
 is difficult, especially in smalI enterprises and the informal sector. Workers who re-
 move themselves from situations that endanger their health and safety have their
 
 
 359
 
 employment protected, provided they have asked the workers' delegate to bring the
 problem to the attention of labor inspectors.
