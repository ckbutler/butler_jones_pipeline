 DENMARK
 Denmark is a constitutional monarchy with a long
 democratic tradition. It has a unicameral
 legislature of 179 members, elected in part
 proportionally by a complicated system that allows
 representation for any party which can get two per-
 cent of the vote. Measures to safeguard minorities
 include provisions for referenda on parliamentary
 bills when demanded by one-third of the members.
 The Danish spirit of compromise and moderation has
 fostered the creation of a society marked by
 humanitarianism and a highly developed social
 welfare system. The constitution contains specific
 provisions for protection of human rights, and these
 constitutional provisions are supported by
 statutes. Human rights policies receive broad
 official and public support in Denmark.
 I. Respect for the Integrity of the Person,
 Including Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Protection against offenses committed by any person
 against the integrity of another person is contained
 in Section 244 of the Criminal Code. There is no
 indication of torture in Denmark.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Protection against cruel, inhuman or degrading
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Provisions of Sections 244 and 245 of the
 Criminal Code prohibit cruel and unusual punishment
 and establish penalties where bodily harm is
 associated with cruelty. These provisions also
 cover offenses against persons in the form of
 medical and scientific experiments. Capital
 punishment, corporal punishment, and imprisonment
 with hard labor have been abolished.
 c. Disappearances
 Danish police and security forces carry out no
 abductions, secret arrests or clandestine detention.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 No Danish subject can be deprived of his liberty
 because of political or religious beliefs. Article
 71 of the constitution, which provides that personal
 liberty shall be inviolable without due process of
 law, is respected in practice.
 Persons taken into custody must be taken before a
 judge within 24 hours ot arrest. If the person
 cannot be immediately released, the judge must
 decide within three days whether the individual
 should be committed to prison or is eligible for
 release on bail. The judge also has authority to
 determine the amount and the nature of bail. These
 
 
 770
 judgments are subject to appeal procedures. The
 constitution states that persons may not be held in
 pre-trial confinement for offenses which would
 normally be resolved by payment of fines or by
 mitigated (sentences of seven days up to six months)
 imprisonment until sentence is imposed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 It is a basic tenet ot Danish justice that trials be
 open and public. The principle of public hearings
 may be limited to protect the parties and
 witnesses. Persons without means to hire legal
 assistance may request aid and persons unfamiliar
 with the Danish language are provided with
 interpreter service.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Article 72 of the constitution provides for the
 protection of the home. This section also prohibits
 the seizure and examination of letters or violation
 of the secrecy of postal, telegraph, and telephone
 communications except under judicial order. These
 legal provisions are respected in practice.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care. and Education
 Fulfilling the basic needs of the population for
 food, shelter, health care, and education are major
 objectives of the Danish government which stresses
 full consideration for less privileged elements of
 the society. A comprehensive policy on social
 welfare includes provisions for health and medical
 services, welfare service, various family benefits,
 pensions, and disability and unemployment insurance.
 Expansion of health, education and welfare programs
 in Denmark has contributed significantly to the
 rapid growth in public outlays which in 1979
 exceeded 55 percent of GDP (1979 GDP totals $64,829
 million or $12,761 per capita). The current
 recession, a 14 per cent inflation rate, and a
 disproportionately large external debt have forced a
 belt-tightening which has resulted in a slight
 decline in the Danes' purchasing power. Given the
 present unemployment rate of some 7 per cent and the
 continued sluggishness of the economy, the
 government has been forced to cut expenditures.
 here is strong pressure, however, for social
 services to be spared sharp cutbacks.
 Social security, unemployment benefits, sick pay and
 other benefits in 1979 accounted for close to 30 per-
 cent of health, education, and welfare services
 extended by central and local government or 35 per-
 cent of government budgets. Should there be charges
 that government programs are not being carried out
 fairly, ombudsmen may investigate the case.

 3. Respect for Civil and Political Rights,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Religious freedom is guaranteed by the provisions of
 Part VII, Articles 67, 68, and 70 ot the
 constitution. Language on freedom of speech, press
 and assembly are contained in Articles 77 and 78.
 These constitutional provisions are honored both in
 spirit and practice.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There is complete freedom of movement, emigration,
 and foreign travel.
 In 1979, Denmark admitted a total of 1095 refugees,
 more than double the number admitted in 1978. In
 1980 Denmark reverted to the normal quota of 500
 refugees per year with an additional allowance for
 refugees rescued at sea. The bulk of the refugees
 recently have come from Indochina. The number of
 entries from other developing nations has declined
 while the number of refugees from Eastern Europe (46
 in 1979) has increased by 50 per cent this year.
 Refugee assistance is coordinated through the Danish
 Refugee Council composed of 12 public and private
 organizations. Among the groups represented on the
 council are Amnesty International, Caritas, the
 Danish National Council of Women, and the Danish
 Jewish Community. Refugee selection principles are
 agreed upon by a committee of representatives of the
 Ministries of Foreign Affairs, of Justice, and of
 Social Affairs plus the Danish Refugee Council.
 Welfare assistance is based on the principles of
 Danish Social Law, as applied to Danish citizens,
 adapted to the individual needs of refugees.
 Welfare aid is designed to make the refugee
 self-reliant in the community. The program includes
 counselling, financial aid, Danish language
 training, aid with housing, employment, and social
 contact. Requests for asylum are handled by the
 Ministry of Justice and are channeled through the
 alien police. If the alien police report is
 negative, there is an informal hearing in which the
 Danish Refugee Council participates before the
 Ministry makes a final decision.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Political life is carried out in a highly democratic
 fashion. There is respect for civil and political
 liberties both on theoretical level and in
 practice. Danish law guarantees trade unions the
 right to organize, strike, bargain collectively, and
 lobby. The labor movement, a powerful social and
 political force, fully protects the rights of both
 sexes, a policy backed up by advanced and
 comprehensive public welfare legislation.
 
 
 772
 Danish women hold high and influential positions in
 virtually every area of society. They are cabinet
 ministers, parliamentarians, judges, and journalists and
 are integrated into the governmental bureaucracy at
 all levels. However, unemployment among young women
 is roughly twice that among young men. The average
 income of women is 90 percent that of men.
 4. Government    Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violation of Human Rights
 Denmark has conceptually and in practice been a
 leader in the field of human rights. It has
 supported human rights in international fora and
 been in the vanguard of those furthering the rights
 of women, the disadvantaged and the poor. The human
 rights record is open for international appraisal
 and was recently reviewed before the European
 Commission of Human Rights. Denmark is a party to
 the International Covenant on Civil and Political
 Rights (including the Optional Protocol), the
 Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights,
 and the European Convention on Human Rights.
