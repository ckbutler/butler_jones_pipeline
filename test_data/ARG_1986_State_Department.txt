 ARGENTINA
 Argentina is a functioning constitutional democracy with an
 independent bicameral legislature and an autonomous
 judiciary. Political debate is free and open with a high
 degree of public participation. The Argentine press offers
 views covering the political spectrum and all parties have
 access to the media, although some suggest the Government
 provides strong guidance on certain issues. The Government
 tolerates criticism and opposition viewpoints are freely
 expressed.
 Argentines enjoyed a relatively high standard of living in
 1986, despite a number of severe economic problems including a
 large foreign debt and real wages and pensions generally
 believed to be below the level of a decade earlier.
 Argentina continued to consolidate the dramatic improvements
 in human rights stemming from the successful 1983 transition
 from military to freely elected civilian government. The
 military and police operate under civilian political control
 and the courts review charges of abuses. Respect for
 individual rights is strong. Trade union freedom is greater
 than at any time during the past decade, and strikes occurred
 frequently. Human rights groups continue to demand a complete
 accounting for past disappearances and punishment of those
 responsible. Trials of military and police officials and of
 accused terrorists for actions in the 1970's continue, albeit
 slowly. There was some tension between civilian and military
 authorities over the possible prosecution of military
 personnel, particularly those still on active duty. Violent
 incidents by unknown assailants occurred with some frequency,
 generally without personal injuries. Most seemed related to
 political or labor activities.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No human rights groups charged that any deaths were
 politically motivated or instigated by the Government, and
 there were no known instances of such killings.
 Periodic bombings occurred throughout the year. Most were
 small explosions late at night which caused few injuries and
 little damage. Most of the bombings appear politically
 motivated, judging by targets selected and accompanying
 messages. During a presidential visit to a military camp in
 Cordoba, a bomb was discovered and disarmed. Political party
 offices and the residences or businesses of party activists
 were primary targets. Most sectors of the political spectrum
 were victimized, from the military to the Communists. The
 widely reported bombings no doubt served to intimidate in
 individual localities. Local authorities have made only a few
 arrests. What was learned from those arrests suggests no
 major conspiracy.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known abductions, secret arrests, or
 disappearances linked to or condoned by the Government during
 1986. A substantial number of kidnapings occurred, most
 
 
 387
 ARGENTINA
 believed to have been for criminal extortion. Not all were
 reported to the authorities, and many ended in release of the
 victim without identification of the perpetrators. Some
 kidnapers were apprehended and others killed in police raids.
 In the apparent kidnaping of businessman Osvaldo Sivak, family
 members alleged that security force personnel pocketed
 payments made by the families. It is widely believed that
 some current or former police and military personnel are
 involved in kidnaping for extortion.
 In addition to continued ad hoc investigations by the courts
 of unmarked graves, through which some corpses were identified
 as victims who had disappeared, the Interior Ministry in 1986
 initiated a formal review of all cemetery records to locate
 and identify victims who disappeared between 1973-80.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture. A 1985 criminal code
 reform provides penalties for torture similar to those applied
 for homicide. In August the Argentine Congress ratified the
 Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel,
 Degrading, or Inhuman Punishment adopted by the United Nations
 General Assembly in 1984. The Convention now has the force of
 domestic law. Although judges applied the new provisions of
 the criminal code, some human rights groups maintain that
 police beatings of prisoners continue. In at least 31
 instances, police or prison officials were brought to court on
 charges of mistreatment of prisoners. Judicial investigations
 into the alleged torture of prisoners during the years of
 military rule (1976-1983) continued.
 Despite improved prison conditions since the return of
 democracy in 1983, there were prison demonstrations, hunger
 strikes, and riots in 1986. The protests allegedly resulted
 from harsh treatment of prisoners during cell-block searches,
 disrespectful treatment of visiting family members, and
 prisoner demands for better food, living conditions, speedier
 trials, and reductions in sentences. A number of prisoners
 were injured during these protests. Two families charged that
 relatives died in detention as a result of physical abuse by
 prison authorities; two police officers and six prison guards
 are under investigation in that case. Government officials
 say they are working to improve prison conditions, which are
 generally overcrowded but sanitary.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Argentina has a well-developed legal code containing express
 protections of individual rights and controls on police arrest
 and investigatory powers. The penal code gives the
 courts--but not the police--authority to detain individuals
 without notice or charges for up to 8 days during
 investigations. Even in the case of minor offenses, holding
 suspects without charges for a few days is common. Forced or
 compulsory labor is forbidden.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary functioned normally in 1986. It was generally
 recognized as fair and independent, if often slow and
 cumbersome. The Constitution and penal code provide for
 trials before professional judges and appellate review of all
 
 
 388
 ARGENTINA
 judicial rulings, including those of military courts. The
 Supreme Court interprets the Constitution to provide
 protection and review roughly equivalent to the due process
 clause of the U.S. Constitution.
 Major judicial problems are overcrowded court dockets,
 time-consuming written procedures, lack of personnel and
 administrative infrastructure, and low salaries, as in the
 rest of the public sector. Since the return to democracy in
 1983, the legal community has had under consideration several
 reforms in the system of judicial administration. These
 reforms would streamline the judicial system by developing
 more efficient legal procedures and creating more professional
 personnel. As in most civil-law countries, trial by jury does
 not exist; verdicts are rendered by professional judges. The
 police have legal authority to judge misdemeanor cases, which
 are often settled by senior police officials. Convictions in
 most such cases result only in fines and may be appealed to
 the civil courts. The legal system provides for public
 defenders, but in 1986 caseloads were far in excess of what
 they could handle. The right to bail is provided by law and
 observed in practice.
 At the start of 1986, some human rights groups claimed there
 were still 14 political prisoners. The Government argues that
 they are not political prisoners, but common criminals
 convicted of violent crimes. The Government asserts it cannot
 summarily overturn the verdicts or alter the sentences. The
 human rights groups argue that the prisoners were convicted
 under proceedings lacking in minimum due process. The
 prisoners claim they were forced to confess under torture or
 duress and were denied fair trials. The Government suggested
 that the prisoners request a judicial review of their cases.
 Some did so, and two were released in 1986. In the other
 cases, the courts found they did not have judicial grounds to
 alter the sentences. Twelve remain in jail. Prosecution of
 Argentina's best known former terrorist, Montonero leader
 Mario Firmenich, remains in the evidentiary stage.
 The most sensitive judicial issue continued to be the
 prosecution of military personnel for abuses during the years
 of military rule. Five former senior commanders and junta
 members convicted by a civilian court in December 1985 filed
 appeals. Likewise, the Government appealed the leniency of
 sentences given these five and the acquittals of four other
 officers in the same trial. On December 30, the Supreme Court
 ruled on the appeals, upholding all verdicts, ordering
 slightly reduced sentences in two cases. The other major
 military trial of 1986 involved a former army general, who
 served as police chief of Buehos Aires Province, and several
 of his military and police colleagues. Convictions were
 obtained in November against five of the seven defendants and
 varying sentences of prison terms were handed down by the
 court. Two defendants were acquitted. Human rights groups
 complain that there has been no progress on other military
 trials.
 In 1986, much of the human rights debate centered on the so-
 called "punto final"--declaring an end to prosecutions for
 past abuses by the military. The military supports the idea;
 human rights activists oppose it. President Alfonsin
 submitted draft legislation imposing a 30-day statute of
 limitations upon initiation of criminal prosecutions against
 members of the military for past abuses. Following an
 unusually rapid passage through both houses of the
 
 
 389
 ARGENTINA
 legislature, Congress passed the legislation in special
 session on December 23, 1986. Congress amended the
 legislation to extend the statute of limitations to 60 days
 from date of enactment and to include civilians who had
 committed violent political crimes during the same time
 frame. The President signed the bill into law December 24,
 1986.
 Some tension continues between military and civilian judicial
 authorities concerning jurisdiction over military prosecutions
 for human rights abuses. Legislation enacted in 1984 grants
 the Council of the Armed Forces initial jurisdiction, but-the
 civilian courts may take over a case if the Council takes no
 action within a reasonable time. In fact, the Council has so
 far completed only one case--an acquittal. In the course of
 1986, the civilian courts asserted formal jurisdiction over
 more than 200 cases.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The executive branch submitted a bill to Congress in 1985 that
 provides penalties for arbitrary interference with personal
 privacy, home, or correspondence. The legislation is still
 pending.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Argentina enjoys a free press environment. Criticism of the
 Government is tolerated and opposition viewpoints are freely
 expressed. An independent press offers views that cover the
 entire political spectrum. Nevertheless, the State owns 40
 percent of the radio stations and 3 of the 4 principal Buenos
 Aires television channels. The Inter-American Press
 Association's 1986 report criticizes Argentina for government
 domination of the national newsprint industry, for
 congressional censure in September 1986 of a Buenos Aires
 daily, and for the "right of reply" law in many provinces
 which allegedly has a chilling effect on press coverage. All
 these issues were fully debated in the national press. The
 Government was not accused of attempting to limit or control
 debate. However, some believe the Government's Secretariat
 for Public Information influences press coverage of certain
 political matters.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All groups and political parties are free to organize and
 assemble. Argentine law requires political parties to support
 the Constitution and a democratic, representative, republican
 and federal form of government in order to register for
 elections. At present, no party has been denied
 registration. Major rallies were held by political parties,
 including the Communist Party and the Montonero movement,
 throughout 1986.
 The labor movement is a major independent economic and
 political force. About one-third of the work force is
 unionized. The previous military regimes suspended various
 laws governing labor relations and systematically blocked many
 
 
 390
 ARGENTINA
 trade union rights. Recasting the legal codes to restore
 normal ground rules for industrial relations and trade union
 activities continued slowly in 1986. In Aucust, the
 Government introduced or, in some cases, reintroduced,
 legislation covering collective bargaining, refinements to
 laws dealing with trade union structure and function, union
 rights to consult with management, labor representation in
 state-owned firms, protection for employees of bankrupt firms,
 and the disposition of social welfare organizations formerly
 associated with unions. The main opposition party offered
 alternative legislation in September. These issues were not
 resolved when Congress adjourned.
 Organized labor was active in 1986. Argentina's largest labor
 organization, the General Confederation of Workers (CGT), lost
 its legal status during the years of military rule. The CGT
 technically remained without legal recognition until November
 when it selected new leadership and the Government extended
 full recognition to the confederation. Nevertheless, even
 before official government recognition, the CGT and many
 individual unions engaged in consultations with employers and
 the Government on issues affecting labor and the economy.
 Unions have the right to strike and many exercised that right
 in support of their demands in 1986. The CGT led several
 general strikes of one day or less. Argentine unions are
 active in the international trade union movement.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Argentina's Constitution guarantees the free exercise of
 religion but also states that the federal government supports
 Roman Catholicism. The Government provides financial support
 to the Roman Catholic Church, and the Constitution requires
 the president and vice president to be Roman Catholics. A
 constitutional reform now under consideration would more
 definitively separate church and state. Other religions must
 register with the Government to obtain the legal recognition
 required to operate freely. Missionaries from any religion
 are permitted to enter Argentina and to proselytize. The
 non-Catholic population is growing.
 In the past, Argentine treatment of Jehovah's'Witnesses who
 refused compulsory military service was a problem. While
 Congress has not yet passed draft legislation, first submitted
 in 1984 to permit alternative service for conscientious
 objectors, the executive branch continued its policy in 1986
 of exempting baptized Jehovah's Witnesses from military
 service.
 Argentina's Jewish community (estimated at 300,000, the
 largest such community in Latin America) practices its
 religion without official restraint, although there is a
 current of anti-semitism in Argentine society and occasional
 anti-semitic incidents occur. The executive branch has
 submitted legislation to Congress providing penalties for
 racial, religious, and other forms of discrimination. The
 House passed the bill in June 1985, but the Senate has not
 acted.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Internal and external travel and emigration are unrestricted.
 Exiles continued to return to Argentina in 1986, some as a
 
 
 391
 ARGENTINA
 result of the government's policy of encouraging such
 returns. Refugees in Argentina are not forced to return to
 countries from which they fled or in which they fear
 persecution.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Since September 1983, Argentina has held two national
 elections and a plebiscite, electing a president, vice
 president, governors, all national deputies, and most mayors
 and municipal councils. By all accounts, the elections were
 free, fair, and democratic. In 1986, 15 national senators
 were elected by provincial legislatures.
 Thirteen political parties covering the political spectrum,
 including the Communist Party, qualified as national parties
 and presented candidates in 1983 and again in 1985. Other
 parties qualified in individual provinces. There is a large,
 politically important, and active opposition that operates
 openly. Women and minorities have full political rights and
 are not excluded from political life.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Argentina cooperates with both the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission and the Organization of American States'
 Inter-American Human Rights Commission. The Government signed
 and ratified the American Convention on Human Rights in 1984.
 The Government also reversed its military predecessor's
 position on the draft U.N. Convention on Torture and, in
 August 1986, promulgated it as law. In 1986, Congress also
 ratified the U.N. Convention on Civil and Political Rights and
 the U.N. ;Convention on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights.
 The Argentine Government cooperated in the investigation of
 alleged Nazi war criminal Walther Kutschmann in 1986. The
 Argentine citizen accused of being Kutschmann was detained by
 Argentine authorities pending a court decision on his
 identity. He died of natural causes while in custody.
 Eleven human rights organizations operated freely in 1986,
 despite occasional death threats and some harassment from
 unidentified sources. The organizations continued to bring
 charges related to disappearances during the years of military
 rule.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language or Social Status
 Argentina is a nation of immigrants that personifies the
 melting pot society theory. Roman Catholicism is Argentina's
 official religion and Spanish the official language, but there
 is no official race discrimination and very little religious
 or linguistic discrimination. All religious organizations may
 apply for and receive Government recognition and may
 proselytize. Indigenous communities and small ethnic enclaves
 preserve and speak their native languages without harassment.
 Argentine women are active in government, the professions,
 politics, and private voluntary organizations. Although there
 
 
 392
 ARGENTINA
 is no official policy of discrimination against them, women
 have to contend with a variety of discriminatory mechanisms
 that are rooted in cultural, economic, religious, and social
 structures. The executive branch has submitted draft
 legislation to Congress that would ban sex discrimination.
 The lower house approved the bill in 1985 but the Senate has
 not yet acted. However, Congress ratified the United Nations
 Convention for the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women
 in 1985. The Health and Social Action Ministry in 1986
 continued its campaign to publicize the rights of women in
 society.
 Women participate freely in Argentine politics. There were
 scores of women candidates in the 1983 and 1985 elections and
 there are 13 women in the national Congress (three senators
 and ten deputies). About 20 percent of Argentina's full
 professors and about 50 percent of the assistant professors
 are women. One private university has a woman rector. Almost
 50 percent of the medical and law school graduates in 1986
 were women.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Argentina offers comprehensive protection of workers' rights.
 The maximum workday is eight hours; the maximum workweek is 48
 hours. Premiums must be paid for work beyond those limits.
 Children under 14 years of age may not work except in the
 family. Minors between 14 and 15 may work but not more than 6
 hours a day or 36 hours a week. The same law applies to
 minors between 16 and 18 years of age, although competent
 authority may allow an exception. Rules governing vacations,
 minimum wages, and occupational health and safety are
 comparable to those in Western industrial nations.
