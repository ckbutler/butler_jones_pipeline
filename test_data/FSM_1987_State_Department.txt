 FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA
 The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is a nation of 607
 islands, mostly uninhabited, extending over 1 million square
 miles of ocean in the Central Pacific. Four states, Pohnpei,
 Truk, Yap, and Kosrae, comprise the federation. It was
 formerly a United Nations Trust Territory administered by the
 United States from 1947 to 1986. On November 3, 1986, it
 emerged as a sovereign, self-governing nation under a Compact
 of Free Association with the United States. The population,
 of Micronesian origin, is estimated at 95,000 people.
 Political legitimacy rests on the popular will expressed by a
 majority vote in accordance with a constitution based in large
 part on the U.S. model. There are three branches of
 government: a president as chief executive and head of state,
 a unicameral legislature elected from the four constituent
 states, and a judiciary system closely paralleling U.S.
 criminal and civil laws and procedures. The economy depends
 heavily on transfer payments from the United States, fishing,
 small-scale tourism, and subsistence agriculture. No human
 rights abuses were reported in 1987.

 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These rights are constitutionally assured and faithfully
 observed. There is one small, privately owned newspaper.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These rights are also provided for in the Bill of Rights.
 During political campaigns, citizens often take advantage of
 them to question candidates at public meetings. Formal
 associations are uncommon in Micronesia. Nevertheless,
 student organizations and at least one lobbying group exist.
 There are no labor unions, although there are no restrictions
 against them.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Federated States are extremely hospitable to diverse
 religions, and missionaries of many faiths work within the
 nation. The Bill of Rights forbids establishment of a state
 religion and governmental restrictions on freedom of religion.
 Most of the citizens are Christians, with both Catholics and
 Protestants well-represented.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions in any of these areas. The Compact
 of Free Association permits citizens to travel to, reside in,
 and work in the United States without visa restrictions.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Congress is elected by popular vote from each state;
 Congress then chooses the president and vice president from
 its ranks by majority vote. State governors, state
 legislators, and municipal governments are all elected by
 direct popular vote. Elections are conducted honestly, and
 political campaigning is unrestricted. Although there are no
 restrictions on political groups, there has been no interest
 in forming political parties.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No violations have ever been alleged, nor are there any known
 requests for investigations.. The Federated States do not
 belong to the United Nations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 .Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides explicit protection against
 discrimination based on race, sex, language, or religion. The
 various traditional cultures establish hierarchies of social
 status, and these traditional rankings can influence access to
 political office and education. Since traditional culture is
 greatly respected by the peoples of the Fedrated States, it is
 protected by Article V of the Constitution. Nevertheless, the
 traditional social orders are losing ground as westernization
 takes a greater hold upon young people.

 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Since only about half of the labor force works in the cash
 economy, the corollary issue of labor protection has not been
 prominent. A number of administrative bodies exist to review
 labor grievances, and the courts may also review labor and
 employment issues.
