 HONDURAS
 Honduras' return in 1982 to democratic, constitutional rule
 was consolidated in November 1985 by national elections,
 marked by over 80 percent voter participation. A new
 President, three vice presidents, 134 members of the
 unicameral National Congress, and several hundred municipal
 officials were elected for 4-year terms.
 Honduras is among the economically least developed nations in
 Latin America. Although 1985 and 1986 saw inflation largely
 under control and positive economic growth, per capita income
 declined, and economic problems remain severe. Combined
 unemployment and underemployment exceed 50 percent of the work
 force. Honduras has a mixed economic system in which private
 sector economic production receives significant government and
 international support. A number of government-owned,
 autonomous agencies provide both goods and services; the
 public sector is the single largest employer.
 In 1986 Honduras continued to feel the effects of civil strife
 in neighboring countries, including external efforts to
 promote subversion in Honduras. Honduran media reports cited
 figures of more than 150,000 refugees and undocumented aliens
 in the country, but informed estimates place the number closer
 to 80,000.
 The Armed Forces are traditionally responsible for Honduran
 internal and external security. Closely linked to rural
 Honduras and to the economic middle class, they have generally
 supported the democratic process and broadly based social and
 economic development. Under the 1982 Constitution, the
 military services have substantial responsibility for
 decisions related to national security, although they remain
 under the authority of the elected government. The Public
 Security Force (FUSEP), a branch of the Armed Forces, serves
 as a national police force. Commanded by an army officer, it
 also has limited military capabilities.
 Since taking office at the beginning of 1986, President
 Azcona, as well as the current military leadership, have
 publicly stressed the importance of observing and respecting
 human rights in Honduras. The nation enjoys a vocal political
 opposition, a free press, and a generally good human rights
 record. Although the Constitution stipulates various judicial
 rights, the administration of justice remains slow, uneven,
 and subject to improper political and other influences. A
 national program to improve the judiciary is being implemented
 with the assistance of the United States, and the judicial
 budget has been substantially increased for 1987. Problems
 remain, however, including the mistreatment of detainees and
 the incommunicado detention of accused persons for more than
 the 24 hours allowed by law.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There have been no substantiated accusations of politically
 motivated deaths since early 1984. The May 1986 shooting
 death of labor leader Cristobal Perez initially prompted
 charges of political assassination; subsequent evidence
 suggests his death resulted from a factional dispute within
 
 
 544
 HONDURAS
 the Honduran radical left. The discovery in July of several
 corpses in Tegucigalpa was accompanied by charges of death
 squad activity. Three men, reported to have been death squad
 victims in this incident, were later discovered alive when
 they were apprehended in the act of burying the bodies of
 three other alleged death squad victims. Police believe that
 the death squad allegations were designed to cover criminal
 activity. An alleged subversive died in October while in
 custody of the police. A subsequent police investigation
 corroborated reports that he was shot as he tried to overpower
 one of his guards.
 b. Disappearance
 There was no evidence to substantiate occasional public
 allegations of politically motivated disappearances. Human
 rights organizations continued to demand an accounting in 118
 cases of alleged disappearance between 1974 and 1984. A 1985
 Armed Forces investigative report stated that there was no
 information to substantiate the alleged disappearances. Three
 cases of alleged disappearance in 1981-82 are pending before
 the Inter-American Human Rights Court.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is prohibited under the law; however, physical and
 psychological mistreatment of prisoners does occur. Known
 abuses include beatings, humiliation, and at times more severe
 punishment. Prisons are crowded, and medical attention for
 prisoners is poor. Prisoners are allowed visitors during
 regular hours, and many depend on these visits for food and
 personal supplies. Due to the inefficiency of the court
 system, as many as one-third of those in prison at any given
 time have not been tried and convicted of any crime.
 Extrajudicial confession is the most common basis for holding
 a prisoner. Judges may dismiss a case if it is determined the
 confession was forced. Police claim that this procedure
 encourages false allegations of torture. Nevertheless, the
 Government has acted to prevent such abuses. It fired the
 director of the Danli penal farm in July for physical abuse of
 prisoners, and suspended more than 20 FUSEP officers in San
 Pedro Sula over the course of 1986 for offenses that included
 mistreatment of detainees.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The judicial system remains cumbersome and often inequitable.
 Honduran law requires that a person be presented to a judge
 within 24 hours of arrest and that the judge decide within 6
 days whether sufficient evidence exists to try the accused.
 In practice, these rules are not always followed. Persons
 accused of subversive or terrorist activities frequently are
 held incommunicado for several days or, at times, even weeks.
 The number of such abuses is believed to be small. In 1986 a
 continuing U.S. Government-supported Administration of Justice
 program trained Honduran police and judicial officials in an
 effort to address the many deficiencies and inadequacies
 present in the judicial system.
 A writ of habeas corpus can be filed with the Supreme Court to
 locate a person believed to be detained. The courts and the
 FUSEP have been increasingly responsive to these writs.
 
 
 545
 HONDURAS
 Sentenced prisoners generally receive such privileges as
 conjugal visits, permission to produce merchandise for private
 sale, and liberal furloughs.
 Forced or compulsory labor is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Honduran law provides for fair trial, although social and
 economic status are factors in the dispensation of justice.
 Detainees are- allowed to contact lawyers, and bail rules are
 liberal. Public defenders are available in theory, but the
 system is not effective in practice. Although a new penal
 code went into effect in 1985, judicial guidance in
 implementing it has been minimal, and few substantive changes
 have resulted; a revised code of procedures, which also took
 legal effect in 1985, has yet to be published.
 No secret tribunals exist, and the Government does not hold
 political prisoners as that term is used in these reports, In
 March the new Congress granted amnesty to 31 persons described
 locally as "political" prisoners. The Honduran penal code
 considers a broad range of criminal acts, when committed with
 political motives, to be crimes against the State. Persons
 convicted of such crimes are commonly referred to as
 "political" prisoners.
 Supreme Court justices are appointed by the Congress for
 4-year terms. The Supreme Court administers the court system
 and appoints all other judges, including justices of the
 peace. The Constitution provides for judicial independence,
 although the courts are subject to partisan political
 influences. In 1986 a political pact apportioned Supreme
 Court positions between the governing Liberal Party and the
 opposition National Party.
 A positive development is the increased involvement of the
 Honduran Bar Association in the administration of justice.
 The Association was instrumental in explaining to the public
 the new penal code of 1985 and has sponsored regular seminars
 and forums on judicial issues,
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government normally does not interfere with the private
 lives of its citizens. Citizens are free to affiliate, move,
 and live as they choose. Telephonic and written
 correspondence is generally free from monitoring, although
 wiretaps occur for criminal investigations and for national
 security purposes. Some officials and private persons have
 claimed that security forces monitor their movements but have
 not presented convincing evidence to support the allegations.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, and the
 Honduran press prints all viewpoints. Local radio stations--
 there are over 100--broadcast numerous programs which allow
 free expression of opinion. The four television stations,
 which broadcast on nine frequencies throughout the country,
 are privately owned. Freedom of the press is widely
 
 
 546
 HONDURAS
 respected; both the newspapers and radio stations openly
 criticize the Government, the courts, and the Armed Forces
 without fear of reprisal. In August a bomb damaged the car of
 an outspoken radio commentator and led to charges of
 intimidation; responsibility has not been established to
 date. The offices of the conservative daily, La Prensa,
 sustained damage in a bomb explosion in late December;
 responsibility for that incident also has not been
 determined. Academic freedom is respected and student groups
 play a major role in the formation of university policy.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government recognizes the freedom to organize and
 demonstrate. Labor unions, political parties, professional
 organizations, students, and human rights groups regularly
 exercise this right. Labor unions enjoy a 35-year history and
 are independent, strong, and varied in political orientation.
 Most industries have unionized labor forces and workers are
 free to organize, bargain collectively, and to strike.
 Honduras' trade union movement maintains close ties with
 international trade union organizations. The largest union
 group, the Confederation of Honduran Workers, is an affiliate
 of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 Second is the General Workers Central, affiliated with the
 Christian-Democratic World Confederation of Labor. The
 Unitarian Federation of Honduran Workers is a Marxist affiliate
 of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The 3 labor
 organizations claim to represent about 20 percent of all
 Honduran workers, including a substantial number of peasants
 and rural laborers.
 Honduran labor and peasant organizations play an integral role
 in the political process. They routinely are consulted by the
 Government on issues affecting their interests and play a
 watchdog role in relation to the President, his Cabinet, and
 the Congress. Labor unions were actively involved in ensuring
 the honesty and fairness of the 1985 general elections. Union
 leaders regularly travel to international meetings, and
 several are members of the national Congress.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although predominantly Roman Catholic, Honduras has no state
 religion. All religions are welcomed, and missionaries
 operate in many parts of the country. Members of the clergy
 occasionally have been detained, but for alleged secular
 offenses only,
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Hondurans freely travel within and outside Honduras. There
 are no permanent travel restrictions for Hondurans or resident
 foreigners, although national security concerns have led to
 increased police checks for personal identification, which by
 law must be carried at all times.
 Exit visas are required to leave Honduras and constitute a
 form of control over international travel. They are nearly
 always granted without dispute unless the applicant is wanted
 in connection with a crime.
 
 
 547
 HONDURAS
 The Government announced in March that Hondurans returning
 from Communist or Arab nations could expect to be questioned
 at length about their travels, and that any Honduran found to
 be involved with terrorist groups abroad would be prosecuted.
 The Government also announced that, for security reasons,
 citizens of all Communist and most Arab nations would need
 special permission to enter Honduras.
 Attempts are under way to identify and to register the
 thousands of refugees--largely Nicaraguans and Salvadorans--in
 Honduras. According to media reports, Honduras hosts
 approximately 150,000 such persons. More informed estimates,
 however, place the number at 80,000. Some 49,000 persons,
 including 28,000 Nicaraguans and 21,000 Salvadorans, are
 registered as refugees and supported by the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees. The Government allows these
 refugees to remain in Honduras without threat of involuntary
 repatriation. The Constitution guarantees the right to
 asylum, and Honduras maintains a tradition of granting
 political asylum in nearly any case in which it is requested.
 Refugee experts generally consider the level of refugee
 assistance and protection to be good. The presence of
 Salvadoran guerrillas in Salvadoran refugee camps on Honduras'
 southwestern border, however, has been a source of
 intimidation and pressure, including efforts to recruit,
 divert relief supplies, and impede voluntary repatriation of
 refugees.
 In 1986 tensions along the border with Nicaragua and military
 actions arising from the conflict between members of the
 Nicaraguan democratic resistance and elements of the
 Sandinista army prompted approximately 7,000 Hondurans to
 leave the border area. Some of these people were relatively
 recent settlers in this area and returned to their native
 regions in Honduras; others simply relocated away from the
 border. Reliable estimates placed the number of displaced
 families still within the immediate border area at 250 in
 October.
 The Government--in cooperation with international aid
 donors--has made efforts to protect Honduran citizens in
 border regions and to assist them to relocate if necessary.
 The Government, however, has frequently indicated its
 inability to secure fully its border with Nicaragua.
 Various media accounts during 1986 reported Honduran residents
 in the border area complaining that they had been victimized
 by troops allegedly belonging to the Nicaraguan democratic
 resistance. Complaints included allegations of property
 seizure, threats and intimidation, physical assault, and
 murder. There have also been charges of harassment and
 sporadic recruitment efforts directed at Nicaraguan refugees
 by elements of the democratic resistance. Leaders of the
 United Nicaraguan Opposition (UNO) have acknowledged that
 abuses have been committed within Honduras by members of their
 units, but they have declared themselves committed to
 prosecuting and punishing any member found to have engaged in
 abusive behavior. The recently constituted independent
 Nicaraguan Association for Human Rights also has declared its
 intention to investigate any charges of abuse made against
 resistance fighters or officials. As a result of inquiries
 from the Inter-American Human Rights Commission and other
 international agencies, the Honduran Government has recognized
 the need to respond to and investigate allegations of abuses

 HONDURAS
 in its territory reportedly committed by both sides in the
 Nicaraguan conflict.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 In November 1985, following an active and sometimes stormy
 political campaign, nearly 1.6 million Hondurans went to the
 polls to choose their next government in elections marked by
 popular enthusiasm for the exercise of democracy. Voting is
 mandatory and by secret ballot. The Constitution guarantees
 all Honduran-born citizens the right to hold office if they
 meet minimum age requirements; only members of the clergy and
 the Armed Forces are barred. The elections of 1985 were held
 under a temporary system patterned on that of Uruguay, in
 which the primary and general elections were combined. Under
 this system, the candidate with the most votes within the
 party that received the most votes was certified the winner.
 Most participants, including the victorious President Azcona,
 agreed that while the elections were free and fair, a more
 straightforward system was needed. Accordingly, Congress
 passed a reformed electoral law in October 1986 to provide for
 party primaries on the U.S. model before the next general
 elections, due to be held in 1989.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights.
 The Government cooperates with local and international human
 rights organizations, and the President frequently meets with
 visiting delegations of human rights activists from abroad.
 In response to allegations of attacks on the offices of The
 Honduran Human Rights Committee (CODEH) in August, President
 Azcona ordered a full-fledged investigation, which to date has
 been unable to determine the identity of those responsible or
 the reason for the attack. Honduran judicial officials
 frequently are hampered by poor recordkeeping when answering
 requests for information about specific cases, but refusal to
 assist international or nongovernmental inquiries is rare.
 Local human rights leaders and visiting members of
 international human rights organizations are quoted prominently
 and freely in the media.
 CODEH operates freely and legally throughout Honduras. It is
 the country's largest and most active human rights
 organization. While claiming to monitor the Government's
 respect for human rights, it has at the same time engaged in
 partisan political attacks which are unrelated to human rights
 issues and which reflect CODEH's antidemocratic leftist
 orientation.
 In publications distributed by CODEH in Honduras and the
 United States, and in interviews given by CODEH leader Dr.
 Ramon Custodio during his late 1986 visit to the United
 States, it was alleged that death squads operating in Honduras
 had murdered innocent citizens in July. CODEH also charged
 that a list of names circulated in Honduras during the summer
 was a "hit list" of Hondurans whose lives were in danger
 because they opposed Honduran and U.S. policies in the
 region. The Government stressed that both allegations were
 completely unsubstantiated and appeared to be willful
 exaggerations or misinterpretations for partisan political
 purposes.
 
 
 549
 HONDURAS
 In addition to CODEH and the Committee of Families of
 Disappeared Persons, the Honduran Bar Association and the
 national Congress have active committees monitoring the
 observance of human and civil rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution bans discrimination against citizens for
 reasons of race or sex, but cultural practices reduce the
 number of women occupying key positions in government and
 business. Education is freely available to women. Seven
 women are members of the National Congress. Legal
 discrimination against wives in domestic disputes exists.
 Attempts to remedy this are under way. Ethnic minorities--
 mostly blacks and small numbers of Indians concentrated on the
 north coast--enjoy legal equality, but some social
 discrimination continues to exist.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Constitution and the labor code require that all labor be
 fairly paid and limit the hiring of children under 16 years of
 age. Although minimum wages, working hours, vacations, and
 occupational safety are regulated by law, such regulations are
 frequently ignored in practice. The daily minimum wage varies
 by occupation, ranging from $2.30 to $3.55 per day. There is
 no widespread pattern of wage discrimination against women in
 the work force, although some work commonly performed by
 women, such as domestic and secretarial jobs, is compensated
 at a generally lower rate than some manual labor performed by
 male workers. The standard work period is 8 hours per day and
 44 hours per week. The labor code provides for a paid vacation
 of 10 workdays after 1 year and 20 workdays after 4 years.
 Despite violations of these laws by individual employers,
 workers' rights are generally respected, and strong labor
 unions exist to defend them. There is no evidence that the
 Government or any employers' association has attempted
 systematically to deny workers their legal rights.
