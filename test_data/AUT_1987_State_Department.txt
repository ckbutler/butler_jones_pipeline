 AUSTRIA
 Austria is a constitutional parliamentary democracy. A
 coalition government (Socialist Party and People's Party) was
 formed after the November 1986 national election. The loosely
 united Green Party and the rightwing Freedom Party comprise
 the opposition.
 Austria has a developed economy, and Austrians enjoy a high
 standard of living.
 Since World War II, Austria has served as a country of first
 asylum for nearly 2 million refugees from Eastern Europe.
 During periods of crisis and upheaval in Eastern Europe,
 refugee arrivals rise significantly.
 Human rights are highly respected in Austria, and individual
 rights and political freedoms are constitutionally
 guaranteed. Expressions of anti-Semitism, voiced since
 allegations concerning Kurt Waldheim's World War II activities
 were raised during his 1986 presidential campaign, have been
 strongly opposed by the Government.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings either
 by government authorities or opposition groups.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no abductions-by authorities.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is banned by Article II of the European Convention for
 the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which
 is incorporated into the Austrian Constitution. In its 1987
 Report, Amnesty International listed two instances of police
 brutality in Austria. In these incidents, which took place in
 1985, two persons under arrest allegedly were subjected to
 beatings and electric shocks. Austrian authorities stated
 that their investigations showed the charges were unfounded.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary detention or exile. The
 law provides for investigative detention for 72 hours, by
 which time an investigative judge must decide on the legality
 of the detention. Provided the investigative judge agrees,
 the accused may be held in detention pending completion of an
 investigation for up to a maximum of 2 years. Grounds for
 investigative detention are enumerated in the law, as are
 conditions for release on bail. A 1983 law revised the
 provisions concerning detention by shortening pretrial
 procedures, restricting the number of detentions, except in
 the case of persons who have or are alleged to have committed
 serious crimes, and providing better legal protection for
 detainees. There were no allegations that these provisions
 for investigative detention have been violated.

 AUSTRIA
 In January 1989, a new law governing detention for minor
 infractions of administrative law will come into effect. The
 new law will transfer authority to order detention from the
 administrative authorities to an independent judge, in
 accordance with Article 5 of the European Human Rights
 Convention. Between 1981 and November 1986, the number of
 persons held in investigative detention or serving prison
 sentences declined by 10 percent to 8,063. There is no forced
 labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is independent from the executive and
 legislative branches of government. Trials are public.
 Judges are appointed for life and, in principle, may not be
 removed from office. Jury trials are prescribed for major
 offenses, and those convicted have the right of appeal.
 Written charges must be presented to the accused, who has the
 right of representation by a lawyer.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The law provides for the protection of personal data
 collected, processed, or transmitted by government agencies,
 public institutions, and private entities. Constitutional
 provisions also protect the secrecy of the mail and telephone.
 The privacy of family life is respected. There is no effort
 by the Government to monitor or control family life.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are provided for by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. Austria has a free, independent, and
 multifaceted press, ranging from conservative to Communist.
 Publications may be removed from circulation if they violate
 legal provisions concerning morality or public security. As a
 matter of practice, such cases are extremely rare. Opposition
 viewpoints are given wide attention in Austrian publications.
 Austria's well-established democratic political system, its
 active and independent press, and its effective judiciary
 combine to assure continued freedom of speech and press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association. The Austrian State Treaty of 1955, though, makes
 an exception to this principle in the case of Nazi
 organizations and activities. For example, a neo-Nazi
 demonstration commemorating the death of Rudolf Hess in August
 1987 was prohibited. The Constitutional Law of 1945 also
 prohibits Nazi organizations. The law on the formation of
 associations stipulates that permission to form an association
 may be denied if it is apparent that the organization will
 pursue the illegal activities of a prohibited organization.
 Public demonstrations require a permit from the police
 authorities, who may consider only the public safety aspect of
 the proposed demonstration and not its political purpose.
 Permits are routinely issued.

 AUSTRIA
 Trade unions have an important voice in political life due to
 their role in "social partnership," an unofficial system by
 which Austria's economic policies are determined by labor and
 management representatives. Labor is organized in 15 national
 unions, each of which is a member of the Austrian Trade Union
 Federation (ATUF). This organization has a strong,
 centralized leadership structure. Individual unions and the
 federation are independent of government or political party
 control. Unions have the right to organize workers, to
 negotiate wage agreements, and to strike, although strikes
 during the postwar period have been rare. One member of the
 present Cabinet is president of a national union and, until
 the Parliament was dissolved October 3, 1986, the president of
 the lower house was also president of the ATUF. Nearly 60
 percent of the work force is organized in trade unions. The
 ATUF is a member of the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions and also provides the worker delegate for
 Austria's delegation to the International Labor Organization.
 By law, most employees must be members of the Chambers of
 Labor. This organization, which is unique to Austria,
 represents workers' interests vis-a-vis the Government,
 whereas the unions represent the workers vis-a-vis the
 employers. The leadership of the trade unions as well as of
 the Chambers of Labor is elected through democratic
 balloting. There are, in addition, a large number of trade
 associations and other professional groupings in Austria.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 This right is guaranteed by the Constitution, although the
 Treaty of St. Germain, which also is a constitutional
 provision, restricts this freedom to the practice of religions
 which are compatible with public safety and morality. In
 order to qualify as a recognized religious organization under
 Austrian law, religious groups register with the Government.
 Although 88 percent of the population is Roman Catholic, most
 of the world's major religions are represented. Despite its
 dominant position in the country, the political influence of
 the Catholic Church has steadily diminished since 1945 and is
 no longer considered a major political force.
 Although overt and explicit expressions of anti-Semitism are
 not part of public discourse here, several surveys have
 indicated that such sentiments are latent among some
 Austrians. These came to the surface when allegations
 concerning the wartime activities of Kurt Waldheim (elected
 President of Austria in June 1986) elicited a disturbing
 anti-Semitic reaction on the part of individual Austrian
 citizens. The Government has condemned this phenomenon in
 very stro"-\terms and has recommitted the country to combating
 all its manifestations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions concerning freedom of movement
 within the country or on the right to change residence or
 workplace. Austrian residents are free to travel or to
 emigrate. Citizens who have left the country have the right
 to return. No area of the country is closed to travel.
 Austria serves as a country of first asylum for refugees from
 Eastern Europe and as a transit point for Soviet Jewish
 
 
 852
 AUSTRIA
 emigrants on their way to Israel or other countries. Once in
 Austria, refugees are not forcibly returned to their country
 of origin. During 1986, 8,639 refugees arrived in Austria, a
 major portion of whom were from Eastern Europe. As of August
 ,1987, there were 9,000 applicants for asylum in Austria. The
 1987 government budget for refugee reception, care, and
 maintenance is about $34.4 million.
 The Government has drastically limited the issuance of work
 permits to non-Austrians in an effort to reduce domestic
 unemployment, Austria's foreign worker population, which
 averaged 226,400 in 1973, stood at 146,000 in 1986 and 151,839
 as of July 1987.
 Section:3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Austria is governed through a democratic parliamentary
 system. Under the Constitution, elections must be held at
 least every 4 years. Elections are free and regularly draw
 high levels of participation. The 1986 national elections
 resulted in a change of government in Austria. No party won
 an absolute majority. The Socialist Party, which won 80
 seats, went into coalition with the People's Party, which won
 77 seats. Several small parties participated in the
 elections, including the Communist Party, which did not
 receive sufficient support to elect candidates to the
 Parliament. The rightwing Freedom Party won 18 seats, and the
 Greens won 8.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of-Human Rights
 In its 19a7 Report, Amnesty International stated that the
 Austrian authorities did not comment in detail on the
 substance of its allegations that two persons under arrest in
 1985 were subjected to police brutality (see Section l.a.).
 Austria recognizes the competence of. the European Human Rights
 Commission in Strasbourg for implementing the European
 Convention. Austria concerns itself extensively with
 international human rights matters. Representatives of
 oppressed groups frequently visit Austria and meet with
 government officials and political leaders to explain their
 views. Because of Austria's geographic position, such
 meetings frequently focus on the human rights situation in
 Eastern Europe.
 Amnesty International is the major nongovernmental human
 rights organization active in Austria. Austrians also provide
 financial support for the Bruno Kreisky Foundation, which was
 formed in 1976 to honor distinguished human rights activists.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Austria has an extensive public welfare system, the benefits
 of which are available to all citizens on a nondiscriminatory
 basis.
 Legal restrictions on women's rights have long been
 abolished. Women are entering the work force in increasing
 numbers and have made substantial progress toward economic
 equality in the postwar era. Nevertheless, significant
 
 
 853
 AUSTRIA
 inequality in practice still exists in political, economic,
 and social fields despite legislation enacted in 1977 and 1979
 to reform family law. In 1986, 39 percent of the labor force
 was composed of women, but women's average income was 27
 percent below that of men.
 Women participate fully in the electoral process and
 constitute 53 percent of the Austrian electorate. Since 1983
 a woman in the Chancellor's office with the rank of State
 Secretary has been responsible for women's issues within the
 Government. The coalition Government has two female ministers
 (Education and Family, Sports and Environment).
 The human rights of Austrian minorities are respected, but the
 Slovenian minority in the province of Carinthia is concerned
 about the future of instruction in the Slovene language in
 local elementary schools. The Slovenes fear that changes in
 the province's bilingual education system, which some
 German-speaking groups advocate, would effectively eliminate
 Slovene from most provincial elementary schools. A federal
 government commission has proposed instruction in both
 languages, using separate teachers. The commission is also
 considering a proposal by the Carinthian school authorities to
 introduce separate instruction. While the Carinthian
 government supports this, the Federal Government appears
 opposed to separate instruction as a possible threat to the
 "peaceful coexistence of ethnic groups."
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 There is no minimum wage in Austria, but anyone whose income
 falls below the official poverty line of about $4,564 per year
 is eligible to receive social welfare benefits.
 Since 1975 the legal Austrian workweek has been established at
 40 hours, although workers in several key industrial sectors
 have achieved a shorter workweek. The minimum working age in
 Austria is 15. The labor codification law and the labor
 protection law are among the more important legal instruments
 for ensuring workers* rights and decent working conditions. A
 labor inspectorate attached to the Justice Ministry conducts
 routine inspections of health and safety conditions in the
 workplace.
