 VENEZUELA
 Venezuela is a republic with an active multiparty democratic system, a free press,
 well-established unions, and a longstanding commitment to democracy. These fac-
 tors enabled the country to withstand two attempted coups in 1992 and the im-
 peachment of a President in 1993. Two-party dominance ended on February 2 when
 former President Rafael Caldera was sworn in as President after being elected with
 the support of a coalition of small and medium-sized parties. Four major political
 
 
 520
 roUpings comprised the new Congress which convened in January. On June 27, the
 ermuent suspended the following political and economic guarantees provided for
 in the Constitution: the freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention, the freedom
 from search without a warrant, the freedom of travel, the freedom to pursue profit-
 able activities, the right to own private property, and the right to receive compensa-
 tion for assets confiscated by the State.l'he Government said, initially, the suspen-
 sion was necessary to combat unspecified subversion and, subsequently, it was need-
 ed to provide the administration with the necessary legal framework to address the
 country's economic and financial crisis.
 The security apparatus has civilian and military elements, both accountable to
 elected authorities. The National Guard, a branch of the military, has arrest powers
 and is largely responsible for guarding the exterior of prisons and key government
 installations, maintaining order during times of civil unrest monitoring frontiers,
 and providing law enforcement in remote areas. It also supplies the top leadership
 for the Metropolitan Police, the main civilian police force in and around Caracas,
 and for various state and municipal police forces. The Interior Ministry controls the
 State Security Police (DISIP) which is primarily responsible for protecting public of-
 ficials and investigating crimes involving subversion, narcotics, and arms traffick-
 ing; and the Justice Ministry controls the Judicial Technical Police (PTJ) which con-
 ducts most criminal investigations. Both police and military personnel were respon-
 sible for human rights abuses throughout the year.
 The public sector dominates the economy, particularly the petroleum industry,
 which accounts for some 22 percent of the gross domestic product. In response to
 a financial sector crisis, the Government took control over half the banking sector.
 It also imposed foreign exchange controls and temporary price controls on a number
 of basic necessities, other products, and selected services.
 Serious human rights abuses included incidents of extrajudicial killings by the po-
 lice and military, abuse of detainees, a failure to punish police and security officers
 accused of abuse, arbitrary and excessively lengthy detentions, corruption and se-
 vere inefficiency in the judicial and law enforcement systems, deplorable prison con-
 ditions, and a lack of respect for the rights of indigenous people. The civilian and
 military courts made little progss towards prosecuting officials responsible for the
 many killings during the two 1992 coup attempts, the November 1992 Catia prison
 massacre, and the 1989 urban riots. The authorities also took no action to prosecute
 the perpetrators of the 1993 massacre of Yanomami Indians.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of targeted
 political killings, but extrajudicial killings by the security forces continued. The Ven-
 ezuelan Program for Action and Education in Human Rights (PROVEA), one of Ven-
 ezuela's most respected human rights organizations, documented 148 extrajudicial
 killings from October 1993 through September 1994. The killings involved summary
 executions, the indiscriminate or excessive use of force, death in custody, death as
 a result of torture and maltreatment, and death as a result of abuse during military
 or public service. According to PROVEA, the Metropolitan Police carried out 46 of
 the killings; the State Police, 37; the National Guard, 16; the PTJ, 15; the armed
 forces, 11; DISIP, 9; municipal police, 7; and other branches of the security appara-
 tus, 7.
 The perpetrators of extrajudicial killings act with near impunity, as the Govern-
 ment rarely prosecutes in such cases. The police often fail to investigate crimes that
 they or their law enforcement colleagues allegedly committed, and the judicial sys-
 tem remains highly inefficient and sometimes corrupt. A special pretrial summary
 phase called "nudo hecho," used in cases involving public officials, often shields
 members of the security forces from prosecution, as a case can languish in that
 phase for several years. In addition, military courts are often strongly biased in
 favor of members of the armed forces accused of abuse. In the small number of pros-
 ecutions in which the courts convict perpetrators of extrajudicial killings and other
 abuses, the sentences issued are frequently light, or, more commonly, the convic-
 tions are overturned on appeal. Unlike common prisoners, members of the security
 forces charged with crimes rarely spend much time in prison. The Government has
 not taken sufficient steps to overcome the obstacles that permit continued impunity
 in cases of extrajudicial killings and other human rights abuse.
 One example of an alleged unpunished extrajudicial killing is the case of Marcos
 Antonio Vivas Sayago. A team of approximately 20 uniformed and plainclothed
 members of the PTJ and Metropolitan Police shot and killed him in his residence
 on the morning of July 26. The team reportedly threatened the victim's family with
 
 
 521
 reprisals should they report the incident. The family reported the case to the public
 prosecutor/ombudsman's office ("Fiscalia General") which opened an investigation.
 There were no arrests, however, by year end.
 Organized groups of police legedly carried out many additional unpunished
 extrajudicial killings. Human rights organizations reported that one such group, re-
 ferred to as the "pantaneros" by the local population, and comprised largely of mem-
 bers of the metropolitan police, committed at least a dozen killings during the year
 in poor areas of Caracas.
 In May the Government arrested three members of the Caracas Metropolitan Po-
 lice allegedly responsible for the unlawful shooting death of 15-year-old hg  school
 student German Sotillo Rodriguez. The case remained in the courts, with no pros-
 ecutions by year's end. Local human rights groups expressed hope that the arrests
 indicated the Government would be more forceful in prosecuting members of the se-
 curity forces accused of committing extrajudicial killings. However, there were few
 similar arrests throughout the year.
 In April government investigators discovered a common grave with an unspecified
 number of bodies in the remote Sierra de Perija region of Zulia state. At least one
 of the bodies showed signs of execution-style killing. The contents of the grave were
 sent to Caracas for forensic examination, although officials failed to identify the bod-
 ies positively or provide a definite count of them by the end of the year. Human
 rights activists placed the number at around 15 and asserted that the victims were
 likely poor farmers who had come into conflict with large-scale ranchers in the area.
 Although an ongoing government investigation produced no arrests or charges, a
 special rural contingent of the Zulia state police-which was being financially sub-
 sidized by the ranchers--was alleged to have committed the killings. The governor
 of Zulia disbanded the rural police largely as a result of this allegation. A number
 of persons have come forward with credible testimony in recent years that there are
 additional common graves in the Sierra de Perija and Catatumbo regions, and that
 the graves are the result of killings by security forces to intimidate the local popu-
 lation. Subsequent government investigations have produced no results. Human
 rights groups related that local farmers and indigenous people are afraid come for-
 ward with additional information out of fear of reprisals.
 In August an ad hoc military court acquitted 16 military and police officers who
 shot and killed 14 fishermen in 1988 near the border town of El Amparo. The deci-
 sion overturned an already suspect 1993 ruling sentencing the defendants to only
 72 years in prison for excessive use of force when the circumstances of the killings
 strongly indicated an execution rather than a military action. Human rights mon-
 itors, representatives of the victims, and the two survivors expressed extreme dis-
 satisfaction with the verdict, asserting that the military court had disregarded cru-
 cial evidence and testimony demonstrating that the event was a planned massacre.
 Their criticism of the verdict appears valid. Despite the acquittal only nine of the
 defendants in the case were released-the others remained in prison on charges of
 similar killings in other areas. Three other defendants did not stand trial as they
 had gone into hiding and were fugitives from the law.
 In January the Inter-American Court of Human Rights initiated a trial against
 the Government involving its alleged responsibility for not assuring justice in the
 El Amparo case. The case was referred to the court by the Inter-American Commis-
 sion on Human Rights (IACHR) which charged the Government with failure to com-
 ply with several provisions in the American Convention on Human Rights, including
 the obligation to protect the lives, physical integrity, and equality under the lawof
 all citizens. Prior to referring the case to the Court, the  C   reportedly made
 several recommendations which the Government did not heed, including that the
 Government ensure punishment for those responsible for the El Amparo killings,
 compensate the survivors and victims' families, and reform the military justice sys-
 tem to ensure independence and impartiality.
 On January 15, 1995, the Court began formal proceedings in the El Amparo case.
 Three days later the Foreign Minister acknowledged the State's responsibility and
 said the Government would pay indemnities to the victims. The Court then issued
 a judgment taking note of the Government's declaration of responsibility and in-
 structing the Government to pay a just indemnification to the surviving victims and
 the families of the other victims, with the amount to be determined by negotiations
 between the Government and the IACHR.
 The Government withdrew charges against the rebel military officers responsible
 for the two 1992 coup attempts. The authorities either released the military officers
 from jail or allowed them to return from self-imposed exile. No one was prosecuted
 for the 34 reported extrajudicial killings and other serious abuse, including torture,
 that occurred during the coup attempts. The Government failed to initiate a thor-
 
 
 522
 ough investigation of the human rights abuses perpetrated during the coup at-
 ternpt.
 Liewise, the authorities never prosecuted or held anyone responsible for the No-
 vember 1992 killing of at least 63 prisoners at Catia prison. The National Guard-
 erroneously claiming that-coup leaders had distributed arms there-stormed the
 prison, opened cells, and fired on inmates. The majority of bodies found were report-
 edly shot at close range, suggesting summary executions. Apart from the officially
 recorded 63 prisoners lled,-the fate of 25 others remains unknown-either their
 bodies were not found or they escaped during or near the time of the killings.
 Although almost 6 years have elapsed, no progress has been made on resolving
 the extrajudicial killings by security forces during and after the civil unrest of Feb-
 ruary-March 1989. The Government maintained that 276 people died, while human
 rights groups documented some 400 cases of persons deal or missing. The authori-
 ties buried at least 68 victims anonymously in mas graves. Some human rights or-
 ganizations accused the authorities of doing this to conceal the identity and manner
 of death of the victims and thus protect the perpetrators. Although the bodies were
 exhumed in 1991, only three have been positively identified.
 Approximately 300 cases stemming from the 1989 killings remained under consid-
 eratio n                    0military or civilian curts,but only 1 has been adjudicated. a police officer
 was found guilty in 1991 of homicide and sentenced to 1 year's imprisonment. The
 Committee of Family Members of Victims of the Riots (COFAVIC) continued to seek
 prosecutions and thorough investigations of the 1989 deaths. The Government still
 has mot initiated the effective investigation needed to resolve these killings.
 b. Disappearance.-In 1994 PROVFA reported the following three unresolved dis-
 appearances allegedly perpetrated by members of the security forces:
 In January members of the National Guard sto ped 20-year-old Elsida Ines Alva-
 rez while she was driving between the towns of an Cristbal and Valencia with
 her mother. When she was unable to produce her identity card, the National Guard
 took her into custody, and she has not been seen or heard from since. Alvarez' moth-
 er repeatedly visited National Guard headquarters to obtain information on her
 daughter's whereabouts without success. PROVEA was aware of no official acknowl-
 edgment or investigation of the disappearance.
 In March a group of armed men took 16-year-old Benjamin Vasquez from his
 home, saying they were searching for weapons stolen from the armed forces. A few
 hours later, several of the men returned to inform Vasquez' family that he had been
 detained, although they did not specify by whom. Vasquez has not been seen or
 heard from since. Through third parties, the family heard that Military Intelligence
 (DIM) had taken him into custody, but they were unable to find any record of his
 detention and received no official acknowledgment of the disappearance.
 In April an unidentified man believed to be a member of DISIP apprehended Fidel
 A. Sanabria in Tachira state. Sanabria's wife related that he was subsequently
 taken to the local PTJ headquarters, although there was no record of his detention
 by either DISIP or the PTJ. Sanabria's whereabouts were not known by the year's
 end.
 One 1993 disappearance remained unresolved and uninvestigated. According to
 Amnesty International (Al), 14-year-old Yolanda Landino disappeared on March 27
 following a military raid on her house in the state of Zulia. Her father Mario
 Landino, a peasant leader, and her brother Henry had disappeared the previous
 day. Soldiers interrogated the family, accused them of being guerrillas, and asked
 family members about Mario's activities. Although the family was under house de-
 tention, Yolanda managed to leave the house; but soldiers reportedly captured her
 the next day. She was never seen again. Her father and brother were brutally tor-
 tured while in military custody, including application of caustic substances to the
 eyes (Mario is now almost blind) and iection of an unknown substance that caused
 a burning sensation inside the body. Soldiers told him Yolanda had been arrested
 and would be killed if he did not confess. Under duress he signed papers he could
 not read-a "confession" to collaborating with guerrillas. Mr. Landino and his son
 were transferred to a police station on April 4, 1993. Mr. Landino remained inpris-
 on until March 1994 when he was provisionally released for lack of evidence. lie
 Landino remains in prison awaiting trial on the basis of the.confession extorted
 under torture. The public prosecutor/ ombudsman's office initiated an investigation
 of the Landino case in November. That office stated it was unaware of Landino's
 disappearance and of the allegations of torture until it received the AI information
 late in the year.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture, but security forces continue to abuse detainees physically.
 This abuse most commonly comprises beatings during arrest or interrogation, but
 there have been incidents when the security forces used caustic substances, electric
 
 
 523
 shock, near suffocation, and sexual abuse against detainees. In its November 1993
 report, A maintained that torture and ill-treatment are widespread and sometimes
 fatal Most victims come from the poorest and least influentia parts of society but
 political activists, student leaders, and members of grassroots oranizations have
 als been victimized for their activities. Red de Apoyo, a respectedhuman rights or-
 ganization, reported 534 incidents of maltreatment and torture from March 1993
 through February 1994. PROVEA, discriminating between maltreatment and the
 more severe forms of torture, documented 2.037 incidents of maltreatment and 39
 cases of torture from October 1993 through September 1994. Both organizations as-
 serted, however, that the actual numbers were higher, because many victims remain
 silent about abuse due to fear of retribution. According to PROVEA, the National
 Guard was responsible for 15 of the reported torture incidents; the State Police, 7-
 the PTJ, 6; the armed forces, 4; municipal police, 3; military intelligence, 3; nd
 DISIP, 1.
 Torture, like extrajudicial killings, continues because the Government does not
 ensure the independent investigation of complaints needed to bring those respon-
 sible to justice. In addition to lack of vigor by the judiciary, the Institute of Forensic
 Medicine is part of the PTJ, which prevents forensic doctors from being impartial
 in their examinations of cases where torture may have been involved Very few
 cases of torture have resulted in convictions.
 Four individuals arrested in August on charges of subversion claimed that offi-
 cials of the intelligence division of the Carabobo state police tortured them. Accord-
 ing to local human rights groups and the President of the Congressional Subcommit-
 tee on Human Rights, Jose Manuel Flores, Luben Sanchez, Jose Luis Sanchez, and
 Jose Gregorio Guedez were hung by handcuffs from a ceiling, beaten and subjected
 to electric shocks applied to their tongues, testicles, and feet. A local human rights
 monitor who visited the four in the days after the alleged abuse said their bodies
 were severely bruised and they had visible abrasions on their lips, seeming to con-
 firm the accusations. Family members of two of the victims filed complaints with
 the public prosecutor'ombudsman's office, although there was no known investiga-
 tion of the alleged torture by the end of the year.
 Prison conditions continued to be deplorable, due to underfunding, poorly trained
 staff, orruption among prison staff andNational Guard members, and overcrowding
 so severe as to constitute inhumane and degrading treatment. At year's end, 33
 prisons held 23,554 inmates, of whom the courts had sentenced only 7,508. The Ca-
 racas main jail holds three times its intended capacity. Extreme overcrowding, inad-
 equate diet, minimal health care, and severe physical abuse by guards and by other
 prisoners led to many prison riots. Inmates often have to pay guards as well as each
 other to obtain necessities such as space in a cell, a bed, and food. Guns, knives,
 and illegal drugs are easily smuggled into most prisons, and violence among pris-
 oners is very common.
 On January 3, a conflict between two gangs in Maracaibo's Sabaneta prison esca-
 lated into a riot that left at least 105 inmates dead and scores wounded. Most of
 the casualties occurred in a cellblock the prisoners set on fire, although there were
 additional deaths by shooting stabbing, and drowning in the sewage syste  Prison
 staff and the National Guard were generally unwilling to enter the facility in the
 months leading up to the riot, allowing a state of near anarchy to develop. In addi-
 tion, during the riot, the National Guard allegedly waited for at least 2 hours before
 entering to restore order, prmitting numerous additional casualties to occur. The
 government investigation of the incident led to charges against 52 inmates and only
 2 officials-i member of the National Guard and 1 prison employee. No officials
 were held responsible for the corruption and neglect that allowed conditions at
 Sabaneta to deteriorate to such a low level As a result of a Supreme Court ruling
 in September that the National Guard member must be tried by a military court,
 that court will also  the 53 other defendants. It had reachedno verdict in the
 Sabaneta case by year's end.
 Numerous other riots and incidents of violence resulted in deaths in prisons al-
 most daily. PROVEA registered a total of 498 prisoners killed and another 1,127
 wounded as a result of violence from October 1993 through September 1994. In Jan-
 uary 9 inmates were kille    d 11 wounded tryig to escape from Aragua prison.
 In Apr an insurrection in Caracas' Catia prison left 6 dead and 20 wounded, large-
 ly from a firebomb ignited by inmates.
 In December the Government announced it would temporarily amilitarizeu six of
 the most violent penitentiaries in order to prevent unrest during the holiday season,
 which usually is a period of increased prison violence. Consequently, the National
 Guard-which is primarily responsible for guarding the periphery of prisons--was
 ordered to maintain a strong presence inside the prisons. While the militarization
 was generally perceived as a positive action to ensure order and prevent additional
 
 
 524
 prison deaths, there were several reports of physical abuse of prisoners by members
 of the National Guard. Inmates in San Juan Los Carlos prison filed a complaint
 with the congressional human rights subcommittee and the public prosecutor/om-
 budsman alleging that senior Justice Ministry officials had ordered the National
 Guard to beat the prison population with clubs and blunt saber-like devices called
 "peinillas."
 Throughout the year, the Government acknowledged the poor state of prisons and
 announced several plans to improve conditions, including major construction and
 renovation projects due to begin in 1995. In addition, many prison administrators
 were replaced; the new prison director is a former human rights director in the pub-
 lic prosecutor/ombudsman's office. Nonetheless, funding for prisons remained ex-
 tremely low, and the Government's programs were not yet sufficient to improve the
 deplorable conditions in most penitentiaries.
 d.Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-In the days immediately after the June
 27 suspension of several constitutional guarantees-including the freedom from ar-
 bitrary arrest-the press and human rights groups reported the detention and ques-
 tioning of some 27 persons allegedly suspected of plotting subversion. The authori-
 ties hed 20 of the detainees for several hours, and the remaining 7 for over a week.
 Some of the detainees complained that the authorities intimidated them because of
 their affiliation with a movement led by the released leaders of the February 1992
 coup attempt.
 The press and human rights groups also reported a large number of arbitrary de-
 tentions during anticrime sweeps in impoverished areas by the Metropolitan Police,
 DISIP, the National Guard, and the PTJ. The authorities detained persons during
 the sweeps for from a few hours to up to 2 days while they checked criminal records-
 they released the majority without charges. While such sweeps had been conducted
 in previous years, the security forces greatly increased the frequency and size of the
 operations during the suspension of guarantees. PROVEA documented 6,306 people
 detained during sweeps from October 1993 through September 1994; there were 250
 such detentions in the previous 12-month period.
 The law provides for the right to judicial determination of the legality of deten-
 tion; however, the police may hold persons without an arrest warrant for up to 8
 days, and the courts may hold them up to an additional 8 days in court custody.
 In many reported cases, the police have physically and psychologically abused de-
 tainees during the initial 8-day period and illegally held them incommunicado. Dur-
 ing the second 8-day period a judge may, on the basis of the police investigation,
 order either a formal arrest or the person's release. Arbitrary arrests are common,
 and authorities sometimes exceed the time limits for holding suspects. Prisoners
 often have to pay fees extorted by prison officials for transportation to judicial pro-
 ceedings at which formal charges are made. Detainees unable to pay are frequently
 unable to get to their judicial hearings
 The 1939 Vagrancy Lawpermits the detention for up to 5 years, without warrant,
 trial, or judicial appeal, of people deemed by the police to be a danger to society
 but against whom there is no evidence of a punishable crime. This law is susceptible
 to arbitrary and discriminatory interpretation, and police often apply it against peo-
 ple with previous criminal records who are detained during police sweeps. AI noted
 that many detainees under this law, jailed merely on suspicion, are subjected to tor-
 ture In May the Interior Minister urged police to continue to use the Vagrancy Law
 as a deterrent against crime until the Government and Congress approve an alter-
 native. In October the Ministry of Justice reported there were 187 persons in jail
 under the Vagrancy Law. This figure did not reflect the total number arrested
 under the law and then released.
 Forced exile is illegal and is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The law provides for the right to a fair trial and
 considers the accused innocent until proven guilty in a court. The justice system,
 however, is overburdened, inefficient, afflictedby the corruption of some judges, and
 lacking in public credibility. Case backlogs and lengthy pretrial detentions averag-
 ing 4/i years are the norm. Judges are underpaid, poorly disciplined, and suscep-
 tible to political influence. The law provides for public defenders for those unable
 to afford an atrney, but there are not enough public defenders to handle the case-
 load. The Judicial Council, which governs the judicial branch, stated that there are
 150 public defense attorneys with an average of 170 active cases each, but some
 have as many as 250 cases.
 The judicial process is written, requiring the costly and time-consuming produc-
 tion of voluminous reports at every stage by judges, attorneys, and witnesses. The
 civilian judiciary is legally independent, but the major political parties influence the
 judicial selection process and decisions in particular cases.
 
 
 525
 Military courts can try civilians in cases of armed subversion and in cases which
 involve armed forces members. Military courts are subject to a requirement for a
 speedy trial and a statute of limitations similar to that of civilian courts.
 Persons convicted by a military court have the same right of appeal to the Su-
 preme Court as those under the civilian system. Military courts, however, are sig-
 nificantly different from civilian courts in that by law the President must review
 every case after the initial investigation stage and decide if that case will go to trial.
 Human rights groups assert that this gives the executive excessive power to inter-
 vene in military cases. In addition, the Supreme Court selects military judges from
 a list provided by the Minister of Defense, a process which links the careers of mili-
 tary judges to the high command. The tendencies of military judges to be responsive
 to the views of their military leaders, to maintain procedural secrecy, and to act
 slowly in high-profile cases in which the military is implicated make it unlikely that
 defendants undergo an impartial or timely prosecution. These factors can and do re-
 sult in military offenders evading punishment for extrajudicial killings and other
 human rights abuses.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Con-
 stitutional provisions prohibit arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, and
 correspondence. After the Government suspended the freedom from search without
 warrant on June 27, however, the press reported a number of incidents of searches
 without warrants by security forces. According to the media, DISIP searched the
 homes of a prominent Caracas businessman and of a noted intellectual, and the
 DIM similarly searched 30 homes in the city of Cumana. In recent years, there have
 been some complaints of telephone surveillance, and human rights monitors accused
 the security forces of illegal wiretapping. In September the -Interior Minister an-
 nounced that the telephones in his office were being wiretapped, apparently by
 former employees of his Ministry.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of the
 press and free speech, and in 1994, these liberties, along with academic freedom,
 were widely respected. Venezuela has a free and lively press, which frequently criti-
 cizes the Government and denounces government interference in the media.
 However, in December the Congress passed and the President signed a law which
 forbids persons without journalism degrees to practice the profession and requires
 journalists to be members of the National Association of Journalists. Media owners,
 the Catholic Church, and certain press groups criticized the bill as a violation of the
 right to freedom of expression contained in the Constitution and international agree-
 ments on human rights. The Newspaper Publishers' Association began a lawsuit
 challenging the constitutionality of nine articles in a 1972 law governing the prac-
 tice of journalism and said it will also challenge the new regulations.
 There were no prosecutions for the killing of two reporters, Maria Veronica
 Tessari and Virgilio Fernandez, by members of the security forces during the 1992
 coup attempts. The human rights committee of the National Association of Journal-
 ists, created in 1993, continued to seek a thorough investigation of the deaths and
 of other alleged abuses against journalists.
 PROVEA documented 48 violations of freedom of expression between September
 1993 and October 1994. These violations included incidents of physical abuse of re-
 porters by members of the security forces and incidents where the civilian and mili-
 tary courts sought to prevent the publication or broadcast of certain information.
 The figures for this period, however, represented a positive trend, since PROVEA
 had documented 125 such violations during the previous 12-month period. Moreover
 most of the reported instances took place at the end of 1993 or in early 1994, and
 were not characteristic of the situation after the new Government assumed power
 in February.
 Venezuela has a wide variety of electronic and print media. The Government is
 a significant source of advertising revenue for the media, but there appear to be no
 recent instances in which government advertising was channeled for political ends.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government normally re-
 spects the constitutional provision for freedom of peaceful assembly and association.
 Professional and academic associations operate without interference, and public
 meetings, including those of all political parties, are generally held unimpeded. The
 Government requires permits for public marches but does not deny them for politi-
 cal reasons.
 As in earlier years, a number of demonstrations turned violent and were then re-
 pressed by security forces. PROVEA reported, however, that the security forces also
 stopped 133 of 1,099 reportedly peaceful demonstrations from October 1993 through
 September 1994, during which 5 people were killed and about 657 detained.
 
 
 PROVEA noted, however, that the level of repression was much lower than in pre-
 vious years. From 1990 through September 1993, security forces had killed 35 peo-
 ple during peaceful protests.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for the right for everyone to
 profess and practice a religious faith, provided it is not contrary to public order or
 good custom. The authorities respect this in practice; all religious groups enjoy free-
 dom of worship. Foreign missionaries proselytize actively throughout the country.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens and legal residents are free to travel within the country and
 to go abroad and return. Venezuela traditionally has been a haven for refugees, ex-
 iles, and displaced persons from many European, Caribbean, and Latin American
 countries. They are given normal residence status and may be expelled only because
 of criminal activities.
 Despite the June suspension of the freedom to travel, there was only one report
 of an effort to restrict travel. In October immigration officials at the Caracas airport
 temporarily prevented an opposition Congressman from traveling outside the coun-
 try. The Interior Minister promptly apologized for the action and acknowledged that
 it was improper. The suspension, however, was still in effect at year's end.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Venezuela is a multiparty democracy with a government freely elected by secret
 ballot. Suffrage is mandatory for all those 18 years of age or older, and the political
 process is open to all. Elections for the President, both houses of Congress, and the
 state legislative assemblies are held every 5 years. President Rafael Caldera, elected
 in the December 1993 national elections, took office in February.
 Charges of irregularities and fraud which marred the 1992 state and local elec-
 tions, as well as the 1993 congressional elections, carried over into 1994. On the
 basis of such complaints, the Supreme Court ordered new gubernatorial elections in
 three states, which took place in April. The absence of automated vote counting ma-
 chines undermined public confidence in the fairness and transparency of the election
 process.
 Political views are freely expressed, and persons from the entire political spectrum
 contend for positions ranging from municipal council seats to the presidency. The
 Democratic Action Party (AD) and the Social Christian Party (COPED, both cen-
 trist, remain the two largest political parties. However, following the 1993 elections,
 political power in the Congress is effectively divided roughly equally among four
 parties: AD, COPEI, the Convergence/Movement towards Socialism Alliance (the
 group supporting President Caldera), and the Causa R party.
 Women and minorities participate fully in government and politics, but remain
 underrepresented. There are no legal impediments to their participation, but tradi-
 tional attitudes led to some de facto impediments. Women and minorities are pro-
 moted into high-level positions at a slower rate than nonminority men. There are
 12 female deputies in the lower house of Congress (out of a total of 203), 4 female
 Senators (out of 53) and 1 female governor (out of 23). Indigenous people have tradi-
 tionally not been fully integrated into the political system owing to their lack of
 knowledge of how it works, low voter turnout, and residency in areas far from the
 capital and other cities. Few indigenous people are in government and only one is
 a Deputy in Congress.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Numerous local human rights groups are active throughout the country and vigor-
 ously criticize perceived government inadequacies in redress    grievances. The
 groups operate free of government restriction and interference, although some have
 complained of occasional police harassment. In the summer and early autumn, the
 Red de Apoyo human rights group received a series of telephone threats after some
 of its members were interviewed on local radio and television programs. The nature
 of the threats led the group to believe that the perpetrator was a member of the
 police.
 Both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have released comprehen-
 sive reports on Venezuela's human rights problems. These received extensive press
 coverage, as have those produced by some local organizations. At various times in
 the year, several cabinet ministers, state governors, and members of the military
 met with representatives of local human rights groups to hear their concerns. In
 July President Caldera and a number of cabinet ministers also met with foreign rep-
 resentatives from AI. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs opened a special human rights
 
 
 527
 unit to address both domestic and international human rights concerns; it is too
 early to assess its effectiveness.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Rellgion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Government does not sufficiently enforce laws ensuring children's welfare,
 safeguarding the rights of indigenous peoples, and protecting women against soci-
 etal and domestic violence.
 Women.-The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender, and
 the Congress reformed the Civil Code in the 1980's to make women and men legally
 equal in marriage. Women comprise roughly half the student body of most umver-
 sities, have advanced in many professions, including medicine and law, and have
 gradually torn down many of the barriers to their full par tion in political and
 economic life. Nonetheless, women are still underrepresented in political positions
 and in the top ranks of labor unions and private industry
 The Labor Code specifies that employers must not dcriminate against women
 with regard to pay or working conditions, must not fire them during pregnancy and
 for a year after giving birth, must grant them unpaid leave (and compensation from
 the Social Security Agency) for 6 weeks before the birth of a child and 12 weeks
 after, and must provide them 10 weeks of unpaid leave if they legally adopt children
 under 3 years of age. According to the Ministry of Labor and the major labor federa-
 tion, these regulations are enTorced in the formal sector, although social security
 payments are often delayed.
 women face difficulty in countering institutional and societal prejudices regarding
 rape and domestic violence. The law makes rapeextremely difficult to prove requir-
 ing at a minimum a medical examination wi     48 hours of the violation. Few po-
 lice officers are trained in dealing responsibly with rape victims. The PTJ received
 3,985 repuorts of rape in the entire country in 1993. Women's organizations, however,
 assert that this figure is very low and dos not portray an accurate picture of the
 problem of rape, as the overwhelming majority of victims do not report the incident
 or prss charges due to societal pressure and feelings of guilt.
 There are very few laws to protect women against domestic violence other than
 statutes against assault and battery. Domestic violence against women, however, is
 very common and has been aggravated by the country's economic difficulties. Ac-
 cording to local monitors, the police are generally unwilling to intervene to prevent
 domestic violence, and the courts rarely prosecute those accused of such abuse. In
 addition, poor women are generally unaware of legal recourses and have little access
 to them.
 Children.-Many Venezuelan children face hardship. The Government scaled back
 its ependiture on education, health, and social services, leaving many impoverished
 children with no government assistance. While the law provi   or universal free
 education, children's rights groups assert that the Government dedicates insufficient
 funding to primary and secondary education. Many government agencies responsible
 for the welfare of children are plagued by corruption, and government funding often
 dos not reach the children it is intended to help. In addition, mn eomisiu
 tions for young delinquents are in deplorable condition.      y       isiu
 According to children's rights groups, the recent increase in poverty has increased
 stress on families and led to a rise in child abuse. Neighbors are oftn hesitant to
 report cases of child abuse, however, due to a fear of becoming involved with au-
 thorities and ingrained attitudes regarding family privacy. The overburdened judi-
 cial system, though very slow, generally assures that in most situations children are
 removed from abusive households once a case has been reported. A representative
 from the leading children's right group in Caracas, however, asserted tat in many
 cases a child is better off even in an abusive household than in a public facility,
 where staff are often pooly trained and funding is low.
 Indigenous People.-Although the law prohibits discrimination based on ethnic or-
 igin, members of the country's indigenous population frequently suffer from inatten-
 tion to and violation of their human rights. Venezuela is home to about 315,000 in-
 digenous people in 25 ethnic groups, according to a special 1992 census.
 The Constitution provides for ecial laws governing "the protection of indigenous
 communities and their progressive incorporation into the life of the nation." None-
 theless, indigenous people are not able to protect their civil and political rights or
 to influence decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, and the allocation
 of natural resources. For example, indigenous groups were not successful in obtain-
 ing the legislation they sought to preserve ancestral lands and cultures, or to enact
 proportional representation to provide more ethnic minorities in the country's legis-
 lative bodies, Indian rights advocates have noted that few indigenous people work
 in government agencies responsible for Indian affairs.
 
 
 528
 Many of the country's indigenous people live isolated from modern civilization and
 lack access to basic health and educational facilities theoretically available to all
 Venezuelans. High rates of cholera, hepatitis-B, malaria, and other diseases plague
 their communities. Tourists and other outsiders inadvertently introduce new viruses
 to Indian populations with unprepared immune systems: the common cold often be-
 comes bronchitis, and chicken pox can be fatal. In addition, few indigenous commu-
 nities hold title to their lands, and many have been displaced in recent years by
 government-sponsored proects. Fertilizer and machinery have polluted rivera, while
 strip mining and large-me farming have destroyed habitats.
 The Yanomami, the most primitive of the indigenous people in Venezuela, have
 been subject to persistent incursions into their territory by illegal Brazilian gold
 miners. The miners have not only brought diseases but reportedly coerced some of
 the Indians to be servants and prostitutes. In August 1993, miners killed at least
 16 Yanomami in a remote area of Amazonas state. An indigenous people's group re-
 ported two similar k      in 1994. The Government began to bomb illegal airstri
 used by the miners and to use force to try to prevent  he miners' entry along e
 porous border. Indigenous peoples' groups, however, strongly criticized the Govern-
 ment for not forcefully seeking the proection of the perpetrators of the 1993 mas-
 sacre who had retreated into Baiian territory.
 In February members of the army shot and killed three members of the Yucpa
 ethnic group after women in the group tried to block the soldiers from taking wood
 they had cut. The military allegedly responded by firing indiscriminately. To protest
 the killing, a large group of Yucpas temporarily took over several ranches and
 blocked rads. The investigation of the killings was impeded in March due to a ju-
 risdictional dispute between military and civilian courts. There were no arrests by
 the end of the year.
 People With Disabilities.-In 1993 the Government passed the first comprehensive
 law to protect the rights of the disabled. The new law requires that all newly con-
 structed or renovated public parks and buildings provide access for the disabled.
 Among other important provisions, the law forbids discrimination in employment
 practices and in the provi'sion of public services. However, the Government idnot
 make a significant effort to implement the law, to inform the public of the new law,
 or to try to change societal prejudice against the disabled.
 The physically impaired still have minimal access to public transportation, and
 ramps are practically nonexistent, even in government buildings. According to local
 advocates, the disabled are discriminated against in many sectors, including edu-
 cation, health care, and employment. There have been a few reported incidents in
 which public university programs expelled disabled people and hospitals turned
 them away, even for the treatment of afflictions unrelat ed to their disability.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Both the Constitution and labor law recognize and
 encourage the right of unions to exist. The comprehensive 1990 Labor Code extends
 to all private sector and public sector employees (except members of the armed
 forces) the right to form and join unions of their choosing. The Code mandates reg-
 istration of unions with the Ministry of Labor, but it reduces the Ministry's discre-
 tion by specifying that registration may not be denied if the proper documents (a
 record of the founding meeting, the statutes, and the membership list) are submit-
 ted. Only a judge may dissolve a union, and then ony for reasons listed in the law,
 such as the dissolution of a firm or by agreement of two-thirds of the membership.
 One major union confederation, the Venezuelan Confederation of Workers (CTV),
 and three small nes as well as a number of independent unions, operate freely.
 About 25 percent of the national labor force is unionized. There are no restrictions
 on affyiation with international labor organizations, and many union organizations
 Sactive international roles. The CTV's top leadership includes members of sev-
 eavoticalparties. The majority are afuiiated with the country's largest party,
 AD, and the CTV and the Al reciprocally influence each other.
 The law recognizes the right of public and private sector employees to strike.
 However, public servants may only exercise it if it does not cause irremediable
 dame to the population or to institutions." The Labor Code allows the President
 to order public or private sector strikers back to work and to submit their dispute
 to arbitration if the strike "puts in immediate danger the lives or security of all or
 part of the population. During 1994 most stries occurred among government em-
 ployees. With the exception of a prolonged strike by public school teachers, which
 was settled through Labor Ministry mediation, the threat to strie was sufficient
 in most cases to achieve a resolution satisfactory to the workers.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargin Collectivey.-The Labor Code protects and
 encourages collective bargaining, which is freely practiced. According to the Cod,
 
 
 529
 employers "must negotiate" a collective contract with the union that represents the
 majority of their workers. The Code also contains a provision stating that wages
 may be raised by administrative decree, provided that the Congress approves the
 decree.
 The law prohibits employers from interfering with the formation of unions or with
 their activities and from stipulating as a condition of employment that new workers
 must abstain from union activity or must join a specified union. Ministry of Labor
 inspectors hear complaints regarding violations of these regulations, and they can
 impose a maximum fine of twice the minimum monthly wage for a first infraction.
 Under the Code, union officials have special protection from firing. If a judge deter-
 mines that any worker was fired for union activity, the worker is entitled to back
 pay plus either reinstatement or payment of a substantial sum of money, which var-
 ies according to his years of seniority.
 Labor law and practice is the same in the sole export processing zone as in the
 rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There is no forced or compulsory
 labor. The Labor Code states that no one may "obligate others to work against their
 will."
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code allows children
 between the ages of 12 and 14 to work only if the National Institute for Minors or
 the Labor Ministry grant special permission. It states that children between the
 ages of 14 and 16 may not work without permission from their legal guardians .
 Minors may not work in mines, smelters, in occupations "that risk life or health"
 or could damage intellectual or moral development, or in "public spectacles."
 Those under 16 years of age must by law work no more than 6 hours a day or
 30 hours a week. Minors under age 18 may work only during the hours between
 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. The Ministry of Labor and the National Institute for Minors en-
 force the law effectively in the formal sector of the economy but much less so in the
 informal sector, which accounts for 55 percent of total employment. According to a
 1993 study, some 1 million children work in the informal sector, mostly as street
 vendors there is no other occupation in which employment of children is believed
 to be substantial.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Venezuela has a national urban minimum
 wage and a national rural minimum wage. The monthly minimum wage was $90
 for urban workers and $60 for rural workers. Mandatory fringe benefits are added
 to these minimum figures; they vary with the workers' individual circumstances, but
 in general increase wages by about one-third. In the past, this combined income pro-
 vided a living wage. However, unions now argue that purchasing power has declined
 enough over the last several years to call for a doubling of the minimum wage. The
 law excludes only domestic workers and concierges from coverage under the mini-
 mum wage decrees. Under the Labor Code, the rates are set by administrative de-
 cree, which Congress may either suspend or ratify but may not change. The Min-
 istry of Labor enforces minimum wage requirements effectively in the formal sector
 of the economy but generally does not enforce them in the infor-mal sector.
 The 1990 Labor Code reduced the standard workweek to a maximum of 44 hours,
 and requires "2 complete days of rest each week." Some unions, such as the petro-
 leum workers, have negotiated a 40-hour week. Overtime may not exceed 2 hours
 daily, 10 hours weekly, or 100 hours annually, and may not be paid at a rate less
 than time and a half. The Ministry of Labor effectively enforces these standards in
 the formal sector.
 The 1986 Health and Safety Law still awaits imalementing regulations and is not
 enforced. The delays are due largely to concern that the law provides penal sanc-
 tions against management when violations of health and safety occur and to ambi-
 guity in the law over what constitutes a violation. The Labor Code states that em-
 ployers are obligated to pay Specifid amounts (up to a maximum of 25 times the
 minimum monthly salary) to workers for accidents or occupational illnesses, regard-
 less of who is responsible for the injury.
 It also requires that workplaces must maintain "sufficient protection for health
 and life against sicknesses and accidents," and it imposes fines of from one-quarter
 to twice the minimum monthly salary for first infractions. Inspectors from the Min-
 istry of Labor appear to enforce the law effectively. Workers can remove themselves
 from dangerous workplace situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
