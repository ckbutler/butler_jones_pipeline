 ZIMBABWE
 Zimbabwe is governed by President Robert G. Mugabe and his Zimbabwe African
 National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party, which has dominated the legisla-
 tive and executive branches of government since independence in 1980. The Con-
 stitution allows for multiple parties, and several small parties exist-for the most
 part, weak and poorly financed and subject to periodic intimidation by the Govern-
 ment. These parties pose little serious challenge to ZANU-PF's control of govern-
 ment.
 The Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) is responsible for maintaining law and order.
 The Central Intelligence Organization (CIO) and the Police Internal Security and
 Intelligence (PISI) units are attached to the Presidents office. In 1991 the President
 relieved the CIO and PISI of their powers to arrest, detain, and interrogate suspects
 in internal security cases. In some cases the CIO and the PISI violated the restric-
 tions on their powers. The PISI was disbanded in November 1992. The CIO has
 been credibly accused of human rights abuses, including the use of torture in pre-
 vious years. In recent years there have been a number of suspicious deaths involv-
 ing military or police and complaints of official complicity or a failure to investigate
 these incidents. Zimbabwe's total military expenditures for 1989, the last year for
 which the US. Arms Control and Disarmament Any onducted a detailed analy-
 sis, were $386 million. Members of Pariament (M.P.) have called on the Govern-
 ment to reduce military spending now that Zimbabwe is prepared to withdraw its
 forces from Mozambique. Over the past few years, the armed forces have declined
 from 51,000 to perhaps 48,000 men and women.
 Zimbabwe's economy has strong agricultural and mining sectors and a diversified
 industrial base. Since independence economic growth has generally matched the
 rate of population growth, but new investment has been inadequate to generate jobs
 for the large number of secondary school graduates. Unemployment in 1992 was
 over 30 percent and growing, and millions of people became dependent on food aid
 as a result of the worst drought in living memory.
 The year 1992 witnessed some progress with the appearance of the first independ-
 ent daily newspaper in October, the founding of a political think tank focused on
 democratic reform and several new political parties, and the launching of a multira-
 cial, multiethnic human ri.ghts watch group. However, a number of human rights
 violations continued, including deaths in police custody, police mistreatment of inno-
 cent people and detainees, the Government's failure to investigate, convict, and ap-
 propriately punish those who commit human rights abuses, postponement of nomi-
 nations for elections, and efforts to weaken the labor confederation. There were re-
 strictions on freedom of assembly and association, and government domination of
 the electronic media continued to impede the free flow of information. Traditional,
 often illegal, discrimination against women continued.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no confirmed political
 killings or summary executions by government security forces in 1992. Since 1988
 at least 13 people have been killed by the security forces or have died while in their
 custody. There were unconfirmed reports that Forum for Democratic Reform official
 Mthandazo Ndema Ngwenya and another man died after an army vehicle forced
 their car off the road in October 1992. The other deaths include: Mrs. Namombo,
 who was reportedly beaten to death by three special constables in September, Ms.
 Miria Chizhengeya, who died in June under unexplained circumstances after alleg-
 edly being beaten by two ZRP officers while in police custody, and at least nine oth-
 ers who died in previous years. In addition, Edwin Nleya, a captain in the
 
 
 Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA), died in 1988, and Shepard Chisango, a lieutenant
 in the ZNA died following a June 1991 traffic accident in which he was probably
 pushed off an Army vehicle while in custody. In both cases, their deaths occurred
 shortly after they had implicated the Army in wildlife poaching and smuggling.
 As a result of the outcry over these deaths, the Ministry of Home Affairs
 reinstituted a policy of mandatory postmortems and inquess after any deaths to
 clarify and facilitate future investigations. In April a pliceman was charged with
 culpable homicide in the 1991 death of Clever Magwera. Two CIO officers were
 charged with the March 1990 shooting of candidate for Parliament Patrick Kombayi
 and flight lieutenant Michael Banana was charged with the 1988 murder of Donald
 Kalinda. However, in the cases of Nleya and Chisango, Attorney General
 Chinamasa announced that there was insufficient evidence that either had been
 murdered; both cases were therefore closed in spite of widespread concern that nei-
 ther had been thoroughly nor independently investigated.
 On September 30, human remains were found near the CIO headquarters in
 Harare; some reportedly had been at the site less than 5 years. The Government
 vigorously denied any indication of wrongdoing, but at year's end no official inves-
 tigation had been completed. During 1992 human remains were also found near
 Silobela, Kezi, Nkayi, and Taholotsho, which residents said were the remains of peo-
 ple killed by the Zimbabwe National Army's 5th Brigade between 1982 and 1986.
 An investigation of alleged atrocities in the Tsholotsho area north of Bulawayo was
 undertaken by an independent magazine, Horizon, which carried interviews with
 villagers who gave detailed accounts of killings by 5th Brigade troops. Government
 officials said further investigation of the disappearances was unnecessary, given the
 general amnesty declared by President Mugabe. Some suggested addressing the
 public anger by acknowledging the dead as victims of war, which would entitle the
 survivors to death benefits and financial help with relocation and burial of remains,
 and a certain dignity, but President Mugabe ruled this out.
 The summary shooting of poachers by park rangers became a human rights issue
 in 1992. One authoritative report indicated that at least 163 suspected poachers had
 been summarily executed between 1984 and 1991. In fact, the Department of Na-
 tional Parks and Wildlife Management adopted a "shoot-to-kill" policy to stop poach-
 ing in 1981. In September the High Court held that the Protection of Wildlife (In-
 demnity) Act No. 21 of 1980 was not in violation of the Constitution in the case of
 a National Parks officer who shot and killed two unarmed men who apparently
 walked into a trap set for a gang of armed poachers in Gonarezhou. Two poachers
 were killed at the same site but at a different time.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no disappearances in 1992. However, the July de-
 cision to drop all charges against the three suspects in the Rashiwe Guzha kidnap-
 ing and possible murder case aroused considerable criticism of the Government.
 Guzha disappeared in May 1990. Among the suspects were her former boeyfriend,
 a senior member of the Central Intelligence Organization (CIO), another CIO em-
 ployee, and a former CIO employee. The Attorney General's office dropped charges
 because of insufficient evidence. The Guzha family, the Catholic Commission for
 Justice and Peace (CCJP), and the Zimbabwe Human Rights Association
 (ZIMRIGHTS) all called for further investigation, and the Minister of Home Affairs
 asked the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) to launch a new probe.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and police brutality have long been problem in Zimbabwe. Under the State
 of Emergency (SOE), detainees were often held incommunicado and tortured by CIO
 officials. While the SQE was lifted in 1990, firsthand reports in 1991 indicated that
 torture continued to be employed in some security cases, especially cases involving
 suspected South African agents. Senior government officials strongly deny that tor-
 ture is condoned but admit that isolated, unauthorized instances have occurred in
 recent years. No CIO officials were prosecuted for such abuses in 1992. Police bru-
 tality in political and ordinary cases is also a problem. A 16-year-old by was killed
 and another wounded in November, when plice officers opened fire to disperse a
 disorderly crowd in Seke. At the end of 1992, at least nine police officers were facing
 prosecution stemming from two cases of brutality and two cases of murder.
 Zimbabwean prisons are overcrowded, and the treatment of prisoners is dehuman-
 izing. Due to prison procedures and the physical structure of the prisons, even mini-
 mal respect for individual privacy is often lacking. The normal rate of prison popu-
 lation increase is 8 percent, but in the first half of 1992, prisonfpepulations rose
 25 percent. Officials attributed this to the huge jump in robberies due to unemploy-
 ment caused by the drought and the economic structural adjustment program
 (ESAP).
 
 
 310
 In 1992 the Legal Resources Foundation (LRF) continued conducting seminars for
 police officers that were intended to help the ZRP to learn to act within the frame-
 work of the law-, it was denied permission to provide similar training for the CIO.
 d. Arbitrar7 Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-No warrant is required for arrest. How-
 ever, the police must by law inform an arrested person of the charges against him
 before he is taken into custody and must arrange a preliminary hearing before a
 mags*trate within 48 hours. The law is often disregarded in practice if a person is
 not legally represented. At the hearing, the magistrate decides whether the arrested
 person should be released on bail or held in custody until trial. Pretrial rights are
 generally respected, but magistrates and police officers do not always inform defend-
 ants of their rights. Remands and requests for bail are often dealt with in a cursory
 manner.
 It is still possible for the Government to apply a wide range of legal powers under
 the Law and Order (Maintenance) Act (LOMA) or the Official Secrets Act (OSA).
 Oriinally promulgated 30 years ago and widely used to prosecute political oppo-
 nents, the LOMA has extremely wide and vague sections on political and security
 crimes and gives extensive powers to the police and to the Minister of Home Affairs
 and the President.
 The Government does not invoke the LOMA frequently, fearing that its oppressive
 previsions might be declared unconstitutional. People may be prosecuted under the
 OSA if they are suspected of spying or of passing classified material or information
 about military matters. In recent years, at least seven people have been arrested
 on suspicion of being South African agents, and in 1991 two were prosecuted and
 sentenced under the OSA. No one was prosecuted under the OSA in 1992.
 The Criminal Procedure and Evidence Amendment Bill became law in September.
 It empowered courts to order criminals to compensate their victims in a larger range
 of cases; restricted magistrates frm  a  bail for certain offenses such as rape,
 robbery housebreaking, theft, car thef, an  murder, incorporated Saturday as a
 "court day," excluding only Sundays and public holidays from the calculation of the
 48 hours in which an uncharged person may be held; and reinstated the imposition
 of "moderate " corporal punishment not exceeding six lashes to males under the age
 of 18.
 Exile is not used as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Zimbabwe's legal system is based on a mixture
 of Roman-Dutch law, English common law, and customary law. Every defendant has
 the right to select a lawyer of his or her choosing. In civil cases an indigent may
 apply to have the Government supply an attorney, while in capital cases the Gov-
 ernment will provide an attorney for all defendants unable to afford one. In practice,
 however, approximately 90 percent of defendants are not represented by counsel.
 The right to appeal exists in all cases and is automatic in cases where the death
 penalty is imposed. Trials are open to the public except in certain security cases,
 e.g., those involving alleged South African agents.
 The Customary Law and Lcal Courts Act of 1990 expanded the court system by
 adding Headmen's and Chiefs' courts, which have yet to become operational, to the
 system of Magistrates' courts, the High Court, and the Supreme Court. With the
 restructuring of the courts, customary law cases can be heard at all levels of the
 judicia, including the Supreme Court, but all important cases begin in the Mag-
 istrates courts or the High Court. The village and community courts were replaced
 by Assistant Magistrates courts, Chiefs' courts, and Headmen's courts. Headmen
 and chiefs can hear limited categories of customary law cases in disputes not ex-
 ceeding $100 and $200, respectively.
 The oudiciary is generally independent although the judicial system lacks struc-
 tures to guarantee its independence, suc as life terms for judges. Judges are not
 fired or transferred for political reasons, and the Government generally abides by
 court decisions even when it is strongly opposed to the rulings.
 Zimbabwe's judicial system is hard pressed to cope with ordinary criminal cases.
 Although there are at present over 500 lawyers in Zimbabwe, there is a severe
 shortage of experiened magistrates. To address this prblem, the Legal Resources
 Foundation (LRF) onduted magistrates' training seminars in September and Octo-
 ber. The previous lag in case and law reporting ended in 1990 as the Legal Re-
 sources Foundation (LRF) received a government contract and brought the cases up
 to date. However the production of records for review and appeal remains a prob-
 lem.
 No political prisoners remained in 1992. However, in 1991 the CCJP expressed
 concern about the continued imprisonment of 38 alleged former dissidents. Most of
 them are former guerrillas from current v icersnt and former PF-ZAPU leader
 Joshua Nkome's IPRA (Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army). Another is the
 former chauffeur for Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole, the leader of the ZANU-Ndonga
 
 
 311
 party who returned to Zimbabwe in January. The CCJP has argued that if these
 6 men were dissidents, they should have been released under the amnesty; In Oc-
 tober 1991, one was released, and three were released in March 1992. The cases of
 the remaining 32 were still being reviewed at year's end.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family. Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution formally protects citizens from arbitrary search or entry, and since the
 lifting of the SOE these protections generally have been respected. The Government
 monitors private correspondence and telephones, particularly international commu-
 nications. In March Parliament unanimously passed the controversial Land Acquisi-
 tion Bill setting the stage for government acquisition of up to 5 million hectares
 of land 1or resettlement. Approximately 11 million hectares are currently owned by
 the country's 4,300 commercial farmers, most of them white. Government critics are
 concerned that these acquisitions will be arbitrary and that landowners will not
 have adequate legal protection or compensation.
 Hard economic times focused government attention on squatters and illegal
 aliens. During 1992 almost 3,000 squatters were forcibly evicted by police around
 Zimbabwe, including over 500 in Masvingo, 200 families from a farm in
 Mashonaland Central, over 1,200 squatters and destitutes in Harare, and over 1,000
 from a squatter camp in Victoria Falls. No provision was made for many of these
 squatters and human rights groups protested the evictions and the destruction of
 people's sielters and belongings.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion but allows for legislation to limit this freedom in the 'interest of defense public
 safety, public order, state economic interests, public morality, and public health." In
 practice, the Government interprets broadly its power to discourage free speech. At
 public events it is generally assumed that speakers are under surveillance and may
 esubject to followup questioning by the CI  if their remarks are judged too critical
 of the Government. Although the LOMA provides for the prosecution of persons who
 make racially inflammatory remarks, no one was prosecuted for such an offense in
 1992.
 In 1992 government domination of the mass media tended to restrict the free flow
 of information and to impede the emergence of an informed public. The Government
 controls mainstream print media through indirect ownership, editorial appoint-
 ments directives to editors, and removal of wayward editors. Progovernment media
 officials generally hew to the Government and party line. Seven English-languag
 newspapers and one vernacular broadsheet belong to the Mass Media Trust, a hold-
 ing company heavily influenced by the Government and ruling party. The govern.
 ment-influenced press in 1992 carried more critical articles and editorials than in
 previous years.
 There is no opposition press per se, but a modest independent press, consisting
 of an economic weekly, a political daily, a Sunday tabloid, and three monthly maga-
 zines, carefully monitors government policies and opens its pages to opposition crit-
 ic. The political weekly became a daly newspaper in October. Despite its displeas-
 ur with these publications, including public condemnation of them as a threat by
 the Minister of State for National Security, the Government took no punitive meas-
 urea against them. However, all are plagued by chronic rnancial woes and the
 shortage of governmentcontrolled newsprnnt, in September editor of the Financial
 Gazette Trevor Ncube divulged the source of an article on alleged corruption after
 a parliamentary committee threatened him with a fine of up to $800, 2 years' im-
 prsnment, or bth. Radio and television, the most influential of the media in
 reaching the public, are entirely government owned.
 Academic freedom has been affed by the University of Zimbabwe Amendment
 Act and the National University of Science and Technology Act, both passed in 1990.
 Together they greatly restrict the independene of these Universities and extend the
 disciplinary powers of the university authorities against staff and students. In May
 thousands of students boycotted classes at the University of Zimbabwe (UZ) and the
 National University of Science and Technology in Bulawayo. Riot police were called
 out twice to quell student disturbances in Harare; in one case the police sealed the
 UZ campus and used tear gas to disperse students. Later, riot police broke up a
 demonstration in the city center when students began overturning parked cars. In
 the first use of the controversial University Amendment Act, the government-backed
 University Council expelled all students, required them to sign a loyalty oath and
 to reapply for admission for the second trimester, and banned the Student Rep-
 resentative Council (SRC). After the legality of the actions was challenged in the
 High Court, the University of Zimbabwe proceeded to suspend three of the SRC
 leaders in Sentember.
 
 
 312
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution formally pro-
 vides for the right of assembly and association for political and nonpolitical organi-
 zations, including a broad spectrum of economic, social, professional, and rec-
 reational activities. In law and in practice, however, there are serious obstacles to
 the full exercise of this right, particularly in the case of political associations. The
 broadest authority for restricting these freedoms is contained in the LOMA. Since
 the lifting of the SOE, the Government has relied on the LOMA to limit freedom
 of association or assembly.
 * The SOE's expiration means that organizations, including political parties, are no
 longer required to request police approval to hold political meetings or stage rallies.
 The police need only be given 7 days' notice of public meetings; private meetings
 do not require notification. Nevertheless, in May police prevented a student protest
 march on Parliament and the Ministry of Finance, Economic Planning, and Develop-
 ment, confined all Zimbabwean students to the campus, and later broke up a violent
 student demonstration in downtown Harare (see Section 2.a.). In June the
 Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) defied a government ban and at-
 tem pted to demonstrate against the Labor Relations Amendment Bill and the
 ESA. Police arrested suspected marchers as they began to assemble in Harare.
 Demonstrations called for Bulawayo, Mutare, and Masvingo failed to take place as
 heavily armed riot police prevented trade unionists and their supporters from
 marching. The ZCTU has used the arrests and the bans to challenge the constitu-
 tionality of the LOMA in court, and the case is still pending.
 Nonpolitical organizations are generally free of governmental interference.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is respected in Zimbabwe. There is
 no state religion. Denominations are permitted to worship openly, pursue social and
 charitable activities, and maintain ties with affiliates and coreligionists abroad. Re.
 ligious belief is neither a handicap nor an advantage in terms of professional or po-
 litical advancement.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Travel at home and abroad is not generally subject to official restric-
 tions.
 People who leave Zimbabwe, including those born in Zimbabwe before independ-
 ence are not guaranteed the right to return. At the end of the year a case was pend-
 ing iefore the Supreme Court in which the court had been asked to rule on this
 issue. Some repatriates from South Africa have been suspected of being in the em-
 ployment of the South African intelligence services. The Government, generally
 makes it difficult to immigrate or to repatriate to Zimbabwe.
 In December the registered refugee population was estimated at 135,000; 134,000
 were Mozambicans located in rural camps along the northern and eastern borders.
 The remainder, mainly South Africans, were located in Harare and Bulawayo. The
 Government permitted officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees unrestricted access
 to Mozambican refugee camps. Another 130,000 Mozambicans, many of them mi-
 grant farmers, settled themselves in rural areas in the east. At the end of the year,
 Mozambicans fleeing famine were entering Zimbabwe at the rate of 100 per week.
 In July more than 800 Mozambicans were rounded up in Mutare and Chipinge
 and screened, and 500 were sent to refugee camps. The remaining 300 were either
 jailed or deported. In August nearly 100 foreigners, mostly Nigerians, Pakistanis,
 and Indians, were detained in a search for narcotics and stolen passports in the
 Harare area, and 70 were deported. The Government subsequently decided to re-
 quire Nigerians and Indians to obtain entry visas.
 The Government abandoned the practice of returning Mozambican males of mili-
 tary age to their country of origin and worked with the ICRC to identify RENAMO
 deserters; approximately 100 such deserters were confined to the Chambuta refugee
 camp inside Zimbabwe during the year. In 1992 Zimbabwe refused to grant refugee
 status to one RENAMO leader, who was repatriated to Mozambique. His family
 was, however, allowed to stay in Zimbabwe.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the legal right to change their government through democratic
 means, but the March 1990 elections--with intimidation by the security forces, lop-
 sided media coverage, inaccuracies in the voters rolls, and irreoularities in some
 constituencies--called into question their ability to exercise that right. In those elec-
 tions, 274 candidates from 5 parties and 11 independent candidates were duly nomi-
 nated for the 120 contestable seats. As a consequence of the ruling party's capture
 of 117 of these seats, there is still no effective parliamentary opposition (see below).
 
 
 313
 President Mugabe and his Cabinet are the preeminent political forces, and the
 ruling party-ANU -PF-is the dominant political organization in the country. Fol-
 lowing the amendment of the Constitution in 1987 to create a strong executive pres-
 idency, Robert G. Mugabe, who previously served as Prime Minister, became in 1988
 both Head of State and Head of Government, and in 1990 the executive President
 was selected by popular election to a term of 6 years. The President appoints both
 vice presidents and the rest of the Cabinet, who serve at his pleasure.
 The net result of several constitutional amendments has been the concentration
 of power in the executive branch of government. M.P.'s who "cross the floor," e.g.,
 change party allegiance or ar declared to have ceased to represent party interests,
 immediately lose their seats, and by-elections must be held.
 However, 1992 saw increasingly frequent challenges to the Government by ZANU-
 PF backbenchers, creation of a think-tank dedicated to democratic reform, launching
 of several new political parties-bringing the total number to at least 18-and more
 critical media coverage of public issues and government leadership.
 The Political Parties (Finance) Bill passed in September will provide government
 funds to any registered political party with at least 15 seats in Parliament (instead
 of providing money as heretofore, for the ruling party through the defunct Ministry
 of   itical ffairs). With 117 of the 120 seats, the ruling party thus voted not only
 to continue to fund itself from the national treasury, but also to make it difficult
 for public funds to go to opposition parties.
 In rural areas, only homeowners may vote in council elections. Farmworkers, who
 predominate in the areas, do not have the right to vote in these local elections, en-
 suring that commercial farmers, overwhelmingly white, are elected to represent
 them in rural councils. In metropolitan areas, save Bulawayo, a similar situation
 exists. In the wealthy suburbs, only homeowners may vote, but in the high density
 areas renters are accorded the right to vote in municipal elections. Wealthy areas
 are accorded 1 council representative per 3,000 voters, while high density districts
 have 1 council person per 8,000 voters. Although the Zimbabwean Constitution pro-
 vides for one person, one vote and although the Senior Minister of Local Govern-
 ment, Rural and Urban Development has the right to change the regulations con-
 cerning voting rights in council elections, he has not chosen to exercise his power,
 and no one has challenged these discriminatory voting regulations.
 There are no restrictions in law on women in politics and government. Of the 152
 M.P.'s, 13 are women; women occupy 6 of the 36 posts in the Cabinet; of the 18
 High Court justices, 2 are women; and over 32 percent of assistant secretaries in
 the civil service are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government permits private local human rights groups to operate in
 Zimbabwe. However, the Minister of State for National Security in an address to
 police recruits condemned "individuals masquerading as human rights activists,"
 among others, as posing the greatest threat to Zimbabwe's security. The Govern-
 ment monitors their activities, in particular those of the Catholic Commission for
 Justice and Peace (CCJP) and the Zimbabwe Human Rights Association (Zimrights)
 which investigate complaints from private persons about human rights abuses in
 Zimbabwe and convey their findings to the Government. Other groups which pro-
 mote human rights include the Central and Southern African Legal Assistance
 Foundation, the Southern African Human Rights Foundation, and the Harare-based
 Legal Resources Foundation. The latter oversees the operation of the Bulawayo,
 Gweru, and Masvingo Legal Projects Centers with their libraries and information
 centers, legal aid clinics, and paralegal programs. Zimrights, a multiracial,
 multiethnic human rights watch group, was launched in August. Its primary goal
 will be education in the rural areas.
 The Government has been critical of nongovernmental organizations but does tol-
 erate them. An Amnesty International, CCJP, and Zimrights investigation of 13
 deaths in police and army custody resulted in the Government reinstituting a policy
 of mandatory postmortems.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 In theory, government services are provided on a non-discriminatory basis, includ-
 ing in urban areas where there had previously been a "whites only" infrastructure.
 Zimbabwe remains racially stratified despite legal prohibitions against official dis-
 crimination with limited but increasing social interaction among racial groups. The
 mixed-race community has complained of discrimination in the allocation of civil
 service jobs and in the purchase of government-controlled housing, which are exclu-
 sively reserved for blacks by the Harare City Council. There were, however, two
 
 
 314
 mixed-race ministerial-level appointees in 1992. The ethnic cleavage between the
 Shona and the Ndebele appears to influence government appointments and services,
 as does subgroup origin within the Shona-speaking majority and political affiliation.
 In many rural areas, the neglect of the preindependence period still leaves the Gov-
 ernment struggling to provide minimal care. Blacks on most commercial farms are
 still mainly dependent on white farmers to meet basic health care and educational
 needs.
 Zimbabwe is host to at least six minority ethnic groups-the Dema, Kalanga,
 Shangan, Sotho, Tonga, and Venda peoples-who make up less than 10 percent of
 Zimbabwe's population. Their civil and political rights are protected by the Constitu-
 tion, and these rights ae respected, as are their lands, cultures, traditions and re-
 sources. The Kalanga, Sotho, Tonga, and Venda have complained about the Govern-
 ment's failure to teach their languages in schools in spite of a government policy
 reiring "minority languages" tobe taught in grades one through three.
 The actual status of women in Zimbabwe contrasts with their legal status. Since
 independence the Government has enacted major laws aimed at enhancing women's
 rights and countering certain traditional practices, some of which are based on the
 view of women as dependents or minors. For example, the Legal Age of Majority
 Act and the Matrimonial Causes Act recognize the capacity of women to act inde-
 pendently of their husbands or fathers to own property. High Court judges have ad.
 judicatedcases upholding women's rights, including the right of women to inherit
 property as mandted in the Deceased Persons Family Maintenance Act of 1987.
 The Minister of State for National Affairs, Employment Creation and Cooperatives
 Fay Chung announced that more than 60 percent of the projects to be undertaken
 by her Ministry would be for women.
 Nevertheless, many women, especially in rural areas, remain disadvantaged by ig-
 norance of reforms, illiteracy, economic dependency, and prevailing social norms.
 Women are still vulnerable to entrenched customary practices such as: "kuzvarira,"
 the practice of pledging a young woman to marriage with a partner not of her choos-
 ing; "lobola," the customary obliation of a groom to pay a bride price to the parents
 of a would-be wife; and 'ngozi, the customary practice of offering a young girl as
 compensatory payment in interfamily disputes. In December ngozi became a crime.
 The Zimbabwean Marriage Guidance Society has described lobola as the biggest ob-
 stacle to the establishment of equality between men and women. Lobola haseme
 a commercial venture as many parents, mostly fathers, charge huge sums of money
 for their daughters. In 1991 the Child Protection Society issued a report which stat-
 ed that the prevalence of ngozi beliefs among Zimbabweans remains high and that
 women are deliberately exploited and regarded as currency that can be a medium
 as circumstances demand. The vernacular newspaper in July reported cases of par.
 ents selling daughters to husbands who could feed them (and the brides' families).
 Although a considerable expansion of the nation's education system has resulted
 in an increase in the number of females being educated, males dominate the higher
 levels of education. Legislation prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis
 of gender, but women are concentrated in the lower echelons of the work force and
 face sexual harassment in the workplace. Fear of losing employment prevents
 women from reporting sexual harassment at work. Nongovernmental organizations
 have spoken out against the public harassment of women, especially the police cam-
 paigns against prostitution which affect innocent women as well.
 Domestic violence against women, especially wife beating, is common and crosses
 all racial and economic lines in Zimbabwe. Conseuentlyseveral social welfare or-
 ganizations, including the Harare-based Musasa  rject, have organized counseling
 and research programs aimed at stemming violence against women. In Harare
 alone, reported cases of wife beating increased from 418 in 1988 to 5,000 in 1990.
 Harare hospitals reported 1,763 cases of women being beaten during the first 10
 months of 1991. At the end of 1992, the Musasa project was handling an average
 of 15 cases of wife beating each day. Women's rights monitors have noted that every
 police station in Zimbabwe has handled at least one case of a woman killed by her
 usband. According to official figures, 76 women were beaten to death by their
 spouses in 1991.
 The number of reported rape cases is increasing. The latest figures show that
 2,776 reports of rape were made to the police countrywide during 1991, with the
 majority involving girls under 14. In 1991 a Bulawayo Magistrate disclosed he was
 dealing with an average of five rape cases per week involving subteenage girls, and
 the problem has apparently increased in 1992. When a well-known, blind musician
 called Dr. Love was convicted of raping a woman and then pardoned by the Presi-
 dent after serving only 4 months of his sentence, public awareness and debate on
 the crime (and punishment) of rape increased. The Government has assigned com-
 
 
 315
 munity relations liaison officers to police precincts to counsel victims of sexual as-
 sault.
 Police statistics indicated a steady increase in the number of women appearing
 before the courts charged with killing their babies over the past 4 years. Police vig-
 orously enforce the infanticide law. In 1991 women were prosecuted in 618 cases
 of infanticide, up from 472 in 1990 and from 176 in 1989. At the end of September,
 192 cases of infanticide had been reported for 1992, but the number of prosecutions
 during the year was not available. A court official in Bulawayo said nearly three-
 quarters of the cases heard in courts involved married women whose husbands are
 working in South Africa, a marked difference from the teenagers and single mothers
 convicted in the past. Deteriorating social and economic conditions were seen as the
 primary factors; families were separated as men left to find work and those at
 home were financially unable to maintain more children. Under the Infanticide Act
 of 1990, the crime carries a sentence of up to 5 years' imprisonment.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Assocktion.-The Labor Relations Act provides workers freedom
 of association, the right to elect their own representatives, publish newsletters, and
 set programs and policies which reflect the political and economic interests of labor.
 Workers are free to form or join unions without prior authorization, subject to gov-
 ernment registration.
 The system of industrial relations in Zimbabwe is in a state of flux as the Govern-
 ment restructures the economy. In late September, the President signed into law
 the Labor Relations Amendment Act. The worker rights content of this Act appears
 mixed, probably as part of an effort to attract foreign investment. While fewer sec-
 tors are deemed 'essential services," strikes in a number of sectors remain illegal.
 The Minister of Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare also retained the power
 to set maximum as well as minimum wage levels and to decide union dues. How-
 ever, the Amendment Act relaxed a previous restriction which only permitted collec-
 tive bargaining during a specific period of the year and removed the previous re-
 striction of only one union per industry, bringing the law into line with the
 Zimbabwean Constitution. Labor leaders believe that the Amendment Act was en-
 acted by the Government to weaken the power of the unions and minimize the
 threat of a labor-led political opposition.
 The Labor Relations Act specifies that workers may establish worker committees,
 which exist side by side with unions in each plant. Worker committees and trade
 unions must be registered with the Ministry of Public Service, Labor, and Social
 Welfare (MPSLSW), which is free to refuse registration. The Zimbabwe High Court
 ruled in 1991 that this Act does not give the Minister the power to suspend or
 deregister the national umbrella labor confederation, the Zimbabwe Congress of
 Trade Unions (ZCTU). The Government may, however, deregister individual unions,
 as it did in January, when the Zimbabwe Amalgamated Railwaymen's Union
 (ZARU) engaged in an illegal strike.
 About 21 percent of the salaried work force are members of the 35 unions which
 form the ZCTU. While trade union centrals other than the ZCTU have been prohi-
 ited in practice, some employee associations, the Public Service Association (PSA)
 for one, are not affiliated with the ZCTU. Public servants and their association are
 not protected by the provisions of the 1985 Labor Relations Act since their condi-
 tions of employment are provided for under the Constitution. They are thus con-
 stitutionally barred from forming unions and their association is, likewise, forbidden
 from affiliating with the ZCTU.
 ZCTU officers are elected by the delegates of affiliated trade unions at congresses
 held every 5 years. Although the ZCTU's formation was encouraged by the Govern-
 ment to be the labor arm of ZANU-PF, the Government does not have a preponder-
 ant influence in the trade union movement today. In fact, the ZCTU ana te Gov-
 ernment have increasingly clashed over economic and political issues. In June the
 Government refused to permit the ZCTU to hold demonstrations to protest the
 Amendment Bill and the removal of subsidies on basic commodities. Six unionists
 were arrested. Workers in sectors deemed "nonessential" have the right to strike
 grovided the union advises the Government 2 weeks in advance of its intention to
 080.
 Two strikes at the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) In January 1992 re-
 suited in significantly different settlements for artisans, who gained a 13.5-percent
 salary increase, and semiskilled workers who received only a 7 percent wage hike.
 The NRZ also promptly fired 5,400 semiskilled workers who staged a wildeat strike.
 Labor leaders claim that in its inconsistent response to these job actions the Gov-
 ernment was intentionally attempting to drive a wedge between the semiskilled and
 skilled NRZ employees.

 The ZCTU and its officials are free to associate with international labor organiza-
 tions and do so actively. In 1992 the ZCTU affiliated itself with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions. However, the Government refused to renew a
 work permit for the Harare-based African American Labor Center regional rep-
 resentative for southern Africa leaving the position vacant as of year'. end.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectivelv.-The 1985 Labor Relations Act
 provides workers with the right to organize and, implicitly, to bargain collectively.
 Worker committees, which are by law not organically part of the unions or the
 ZCTU, are empowered to negotiate with the management of a particular plant the
 conditions of labor in the workplace, except for wages. Wage negotiations take place
 on an industrywide basis between the relevant ZCTU union and employer organiza-
 tion sitting in joint boards or councils. These bodies submit their agreements to the
 registrar in the MPSISW. Under the Labor Relations Amendment Act, the Govern-
 ment retains the power to veto agreements that it believes would harm the econ-
 omy. When there is no trade union representing a specific industry, representatives
 of the organized workers, i.e., the professional associations, meet with the employ-
 ers' association under the mediation of labor officers from the MPSLSW. Public sec-
 tor wages are determined by the salary service department of the MPSLSW, subject
 to the approval of the Public Service Commission (PSC). As part of its economic re-
 covery program, the Government announced in 1990 the commencement of free col-
 lective bargaining between workers and employers. The Government has largely im-
 plemented this policy.
 Under the provisions of the 1992 Labor Relations Amendment Act relating to col-
 lective bargaining, labor relations officers, now called "managerial employees," were
 excluded from the collective bargaining process, and the presence of the Z&TU or
 specific national unions in individual shop-floor negotiations was no longer man-
 dated. As the economy contracted under the ESAP and the drought, workers argued
 for shorter days, job rotation and sharing, and other schemes to avoid mass layoffs,
 with little success. Instead, individual concession packages were agreed to as the
 unions! collective bargaining power and financial base were eroded. As the financial
 position of employers has progressively worsened, severance packages given to re-
 trenched workers in some sectors have become less generous. The Labor Relations
 Amendment Act also streamlines the procedure for acudicating disputes by abolish-
 ing the hearing officer level and the Labor Relations Board.
 The Government is still studying the possibility of introducing export processing
 zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Compulsory labor is prohibited by
 law and is not practiced. To minimize abuse of food handout programs, some district
 councils introdiced food-for-work plans, which were loudly criticized as throwbacks
 to indentured labor.
 d. Miwnium Age for Employment of Children.-The labor regulations stipulate the
 minimum age for employment in the formal sector at 18 years, but it is possible
 to begin an apprenticeship at age 16. In this sector, minimum age regulations are
 generally enforced by the Ministry of Labor. However, the Government does not at-
 tempt to enforce these regulations for children employed in household enterprises,
 such as family farms. Minister John Nkomo, at an ILO-sponsored workshop in No-
 vember, and President Robert Mugabe, at an economic summit in Senegal in the
 same month, both acknowledged and decried the problem of child labor in
 Zimbabwe.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.--Conditions of labor are regulated by the Gov-
 ernment according to industry. The Constitution empowers the PSC to set condi-
 tions of employment in the public sector. Government regulations for each of the 22
 industrial sectors specify minimum wages, hours, holidays, and required safety
 measures. In 1992, as part of its effort to opt out of the wage bargaining system,
 the Government did not mandate wage parameters and specified minimum wage in-
 creases only for domestics and gardeners, but due to an ineffective monitoring sys-
 tem many such workers are remunerated below the minimum wage. The maximum
 legal workweek is 54 hours, -and the law prescribes a minimum of one 24-hour rest
 period per week. The employer also usually provides housing and food to workers.
 On commercial farms, the employer may provide schooling for the workers' children.
 The minimum wage is not sufficient to sustain a decent standard of living, and the
 lowest paid workers received a 1992 wage increase which covers less than one quar-
 ter of the 45 percent inflation rate.
 Labor Relations Officers from the MPSISW are assigned to monitor developments
 in each plant to assure that government minimum wage policy and occupational
 health and safety regulations are observed. Safety in the workplace is a major prob-
 lem, however, due primarily to too few inspectors; furthermore, many of the basic
 legal protections do not apply to the vast majority of the farm, mine, and domestic

 workers. Panning for alluvial gold was legalized in 1991, but there was no regulated
 marketing system for the panners, and working conditions were dangerous. Numer-
 ous gold panners died in 1992, when their pits collapsed on them. Unpredictable
 electricity cuts also introduced an inflated level of risk of injury to workers in the
 mining sector. Unions charge that there are no general standards for the work envi-
 ronment, such as threshold limits for manually lifted weights or conditions for preg-
 nant workers.
