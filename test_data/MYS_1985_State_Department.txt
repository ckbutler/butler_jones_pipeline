 MALAYSIA
 Malaysia has a parliamentary system of government based on
 free elections contested by a number of parties representing a
 range of political opinion. The ruling National Front
 (composed of three major and several minor community-based
 parties) has won a two-thirds or better majority in the
 Federal Parliament in every election since Malaysia achieved
 independence, but opposition parties are active and vocal
 participants in the political system and have occasionally
 held power at the state level. Malaysia is a multiethnic
 society. The politically dominant Malay community comprises a
 bare majority of the population. There are also large Chinese
 and Indian minorities and many smaller communities. Most of
 the latter are indigenous to the East Malaysian states of
 Sabah and Sarawak.
 A strong free market economy, abundant natural resources, and
 a relatively small population have helped Malaysia become one
 of the most prosperous of the developing countries.
 Internal security in Malaysia has been seriously threatened
 twice. A major Communist insurrection began in 1948 and
 peaked in the early i950's; it still smolders in a few border
 areas. In 1969, in intercommunal rioting following national
 elections, several hundred persons were reported to have
 died. In addition, the Government explicitly classifies the
 country's current serious drug problem as a threat to national
 security. The remnants of the Communist insurgency, the
 possibility of renewed communal conflict, and escalating drug
 abuse are cited by the Government as justification for laws
 that allow preventive detention of persons suspected of
 subversive activity or of other activities, including drug
 crimes.
 Prime Minister Mahathir's administration has been relatively
 restrained in its use of Malaysia's internal security
 legislation to deal with political offenses in comparison to
 previous regimes. The number detained under security
 legislation reportedly has been sharply reduced to 64, from
 about 500 when Mahathir took office in 1981. However, the
 Government has made clear its intention to continue to use
 security legislation when necessary in the future. Important
 developments in 1985 include passage of a new drug law
 providing a specific basis for preventive detention in drug
 cases, and the arrests o-f two well-known journalists under the
 Official Secrets Act and of a prominent lawyer (and human
 rights activist) under the seldom-used Sedition Act.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports during 1985 of political killing by the
 Government or by any other organization.
 b. Disappearance
 During 1985 there was no evidence of abduction, secret
 arrests, or clandestine detention attributable to the
 Government or to nongovernmental or opposition forces.

 MALAYSIA
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There is no evidence of torture. Allegations of cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are rare.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Government can detain suspects without benefit of judicial
 review under three legislative acts.
 The 1960 Internal Security Act (ISA), spawned by the Communist
 insurgency of the 1950's, is aimed at controlling internal
 subversion. Detainees must be informed of the charges against
 them and given the opportunity to protest those charges to an
 advisory board. The advisory board must also review each case
 at least every 6 months. However, neither advisory board
 decisions nor recommendations are binding on the Government.
 The Government has the power to extend detention indefinitely,
 in 2-year increments. According to the Home Minister, the
 number of ISA detainees was reduced from 168 in September 1984
 to 64 in June 1985. Most of these are long-term detainees
 alleged to be members of the Communist Party'of Malaysia,
 although members of legal'opposition parties (at least two
 during 1985) have also been detained under the ISA.
 The Emergency Ordinance of 1969 stemmed from that year's
 comunal riots. The state of emergency has never been
 rescinded, although Parliament regained its legislative power,
 suspended as part of the emergency, in 1971. The Emergency
 Ordinance gives the Government the power to detain anyone "in
 the interests of the public safety or the defense of
 Malaysia." As under the ISA, detainees must be informed of
 the charges against them, and they can appeal to an advisory
 board. In contrast to the ISA, however, the Emergency
 Ordinance allows the Government to detain suspects for a
 maximum of two years, although upon release it can put them
 under "restricted residence" for an additional 2-year period.
 The Government has relied on the Emergency Ordinance to detain
 suspected major narcotics traffickers when it has insufficient
 evidence to prosecute them under drug laws. Based on figures
 provided by the Malaysian Government, it appears that about
 900 suspects are presently in detention, including 250 taken
 into custody in the first 9 months of 1985.
 The Dangerous Drugs Act of 1985, adopted in May after
 extensive public hearings by a parliamentary select committee,
 gives the Government a specific act under which to detain
 suspected drug traffickers. It strengthens the Government's
 hand in that suspects can be held indefinitely for successive
 2-year periods. However, certain due process safeguards not
 found in the Emergency Ordinance were incorporated in the
 anti-drug law. An "inquiry officer" must both receive a copy
 of the police report to the Minister of Home Affairs which
 recommends detention and also submit his views to the
 Minister. Also, the opinion of the advisory board, following
 either its initial hearing or its periodic reviews of each
 case, is binding rather than optional on the Minister.
 Finally, the act expires after 5 years unless reaffirmed by
 Parliament.
 Malaysia subscribes to International Labor Organization
 Convention 105 which prohibits forced or compulsory labor.
 
 
 825
 MALAYSIA
 Some observers think conditions for some plantation contract
 workers amount to forced labor. However, Malaysia has
 effective legal sanctions, and forced labor does not appear to
 be practiced. (See further reference in last section of this
 report.)
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Malaysian judiciary is generally regarded by the public
 and the legal community as committed to the rule of law.
 Although the courts have rarely challenged legislation, they
 have not hesitated to rule against government prosecutors in
 specific cases, both civil and criminal.
 Ordinary (nonsecurity-related) civil and criminal cases are
 tried under a fair and open judicial system derived from
 British jurisprudence. Charges must be levied against a
 defendant within 24 hours of arrest, and police must decide
 within 14 days whether to bring the case to court. Defendants
 have the right to counsel, and lawyers are able to represent
 clients without penalty to themselves. Bail is available, and
 strict rules of evidence apply in court. Defendants may
 appeal lower court decisions to the federal courts and, in
 criminal cases, may also appeal for clemency to the King or
 local state rulers, as appropriate.
 Persons detained under security legislation and for certain
 classes of crimes, if their cases are brought to trial, are
 tried under special procedures contained in the essential
 (security cases) regulation of 1975. The accused is allowed
 counsel but does not receive a statement of the evidence;
 trial is by a single judge without a jury; and witnesses may
 be examined in the absence of the accused. Admissible
 evidence includes hearsay and secondary evidence, testimony of
 children and spouses, self-incriminating statements to police,
 and information from seized records or communications. If the
 accused is found guilty, the judge must impose the maximum
 penalty. For certain internal security crimes, including the
 possession of firearms, the mandatory sentence is death. In
 1985, at least three persons were executed after conviction
 under the ISA for illegal possession of firearms. A fourth,
 Sim Kie Chon, convicted in 1983 under the ISA for the same
 crime, is under a stay of execution pending appeal.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under the ISA, the police may enter and search without warrant
 the homes of persons suspected of threatening national
 security and confiscate evidence from them.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Government permits individuals and the media a
 relatively large degree of freedom of expression, a number of
 important restrictions exist. The statements and activities
 of domestic political figures are reported in some detail;
 opposition politicians get significantly less coverage. The
 Government is particularly sensitive to criticism of the
 constitutionally-guaranteed special position of Malays in
 society and, closely related to this, any statement that
 threatens public order by promoting ill-feeling between
 
 
 826
 MALAYSIA
 races. Under the Sedition Act of 1948, strengthened by
 amendment after the 1969 rioting, such public criticism is
 considered seditious, as is criticism of the Government's
 administration of justice and other matters. A prominent
 lawyer who commented on the Sim Kie Chon case, as noted in
 Section i.e., has been charged under the Sedition Act for
 pointing out publicly that the pardons board did not grant
 clemency to Sim, a Chinese, even though he did not use his
 gun, while it did commute the sentence of a prominent Malay
 who was convicted of using a gun to commit murder. Both Haji
 Suhaimi Said, legal advisor to the Islamic Party PAS, and Fan
 Yew Teng, Secretary-General of the Socialist Democratic Party,
 were charged with publishing books containing material judged
 inimical to communal harmony.
 The media are further constrained by ownership and
 legislation. All radio stations and two of the three
 television stations are government owned. The other
 television station, which began broadcasting in 1984, and most
 of the press are owned by groups close to the Government.
 Government control over publishing licenses, reinforced in
 1984 by the passage of the Printing and Publications Act, has
 moved the press towards considerable self-censorship. This
 act also allows the Government to restrict the importation of
 foreign publications, a right exercised during 1985 when
 several issues of a prominent regional newspaper were denied
 distribution. Also, an expatriate reporter from a well-known
 regional publication was questioned by police regarding his
 sources for a report on a confidential Malaysian foreign
 policy document, and he was prosecuted, convicted, and fined
 under the Official Secrets Act. In November, a Malaysian
 reporter was arrested under the Official Secrets Act and
 charged with receiving and writing a story based on an
 official document on the force structure of the Malaysian Air
 Force. He faces a maximum sentence of 7 years' imprisonment
 or a substantial fine, or both.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Malaysian Constitution guarantees the rights of freedom of
 peaceful assembly and association. It also grants the
 Government extensive powers to limit those rights by
 legislation in the interest of security and public order.
 After the 1969 communal riots, the Government passed laws
 greatly limiting the right to public assembly by large
 groups. In recent years, however, these laws have been
 selectively enforced. "Political meetings," which the
 Government alleged were being used by the opposition party PAS
 to sow division within the Malay community, were banned for
 short periods in late 1984 and again in late 1985. The
 controversial Societies Act empowers the Government in effect
 to prohibit societies which comment unfavorably on political
 or public issues; this act is used by the Government to set
 limits to lobbying by groups although not to suppress it
 entirely. Under the Universities and University Colleges Act,
 student associations must be approved by the Ministry of
 Education and are prohibited from engaging in political
 activity.
 The Trade Unions Act of 1959 and the Industrial Relations Act
 of 1967 govern the rights of workers to engage in trade union
 activity. The latter specifically prohibits any person from
 interfering with, restraining, or coercing a worker in the
 exercise of the right to form or participate in the lawful
 
 
 827
 MALAYSIA
 activities of a trade union. Unions may bargain collectively
 with an employer, form federations, and join international
 labor organizations. The Government promotes the settlement
 of disputes between unions and employers through the Ministry
 of Labor conciliation service, the industrial court, and the
 public service tribunal.
 Although labor standards in Free Trade Zones are the same as
 those in the rest of Malaysia, there has been a problem about
 the recognition of unions in electronic component
 manufacturing plants, most of which are located in Free Trade
 Zones. (Conditions of employment and wages in electronic
 component manufacturing plants are among the best in
 Malaysia's manufacturing sector.) When the plants were first
 established in the mid-1970's, an attempt was made to organize
 the workers by the Electrical Industry Worker's Union (EIWU).
 The Government determined that a distinction should be drawn
 between the electrical product manufacturing industry and the
 electronic component industry, and that therefore the
 electronic component workers would have to establish their own
 union. A second legal challenge was mounted by the Malaysian
 Trades Union Congress (MTUC) in the early 1980's when it
 attempted to organize electronic component workers. The High
 Court determined early in 1985 that the MTUC did not have
 standing in this matter, as it does not represent electronic
 workers and is not a trade union. Although it appears
 Malaysian unions will continue their efforts to organize
 electronic component workers, it is widely understood that the
 Government, as an inducement to electronic component
 manufacturers in Free Trade Zones, has offered such firms
 varying periods of union-free operation.
 Labor legislation grants the right to strike to Malaysian
 workers. However, union leaders complain that 1980 amendments
 to the two acts noted above interfere with their right to
 strike and to bargain collectively without fear of coercion.
 Specific union charges about government interference with the
 right to strike and bargain collectively are contained in a
 complaint presented to the ILO by the MTUC. The MTUC alleged
 that the amendments to the Trade Unions Ordinance of 1959 and
 the Industrial Relations Act of 1967, passed in May 1980,
 contain prohibitive and oppressive anti-union provisions which
 erode the basic rights of workers, restrict union activities,
 and result in government and employer interference in the
 internal administration of trade unions. In 1983, the ILO
 urged the Malaysian Government to amend these laws further to
 bring them into conformity with the convention on the right to
 organize and to bargain collectively. In 1985, the MTUC and
 the Malaysian Employers Federation conducted a joint seminar
 on Malaysia's labor laws in which Ministry of Labor personnel
 participated. As a result of this seminar, Malaysia's labor
 laws may eventually be amended to expand the right to organize
 and bargain collectively.
 According to the Ministry of Labor, there are 386 trade unions
 in Malaysia representing about 620,000 workers, or about 10
 percent of the work force. While unions do not engage in
 political activity, individual trade union leaders have served
 in the Parliament, and individual union members may belong to
 political parties.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The official religion of Malaysia is Islam, and Malays are
 legally bound in some civil matters, e.g., family relations,
 
 
 828
 MALAYSIA
 diet, etc., by Islamic religious laws administered by state
 rather than by Federal authorities. Nonetheless, the
 Constitution guarantees freedom of religion for all.
 Religious minorities, which include large Hindu, Buddhist,
 Sikh, and Christian communities, are free to practice their
 faith without interference by the Government. Conversion is
 permitted, but proselytizing of Muslims is strongly
 discouraged. Although an Islamic religious establishment is
 supported by government funds and it is government policy to
 infuse "Islamic values" into the administration of Malaysia,
 the Government has refused to accede to demands for the
 imposition of Islamic religious law in cases involving
 non-Muslims. Non-Muslims are excused from public school
 instruction in the Muslim religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Persons wishing to travel abroad must obtain passports, which
 have been denied in a few cases on what the Government terms
 security grounds. Travel to the Soviet Union and several
 Eastern Bloc countries is closely restricted, although
 recently controls on travel to some East European countries
 have been reduced. Traditionally tight controls on travel of
 Malaysian Chinese to China have also recently been loosened.
 They can visit China for medical treatment, to see relatives,
 to tour (if over age 60), and for business trips when they can
 satisfy the Government that such commerce will be of "net
 benefit" to Malaysia.
 Malaysia has provided first asylum to 200,000 Vietnamese
 refugees since 1975. It has cooperated closely with
 international organizations and resettlement countries in
 facilitating the eventual movement of the refugees to those
 countries. Malaysia itself has resettled over 7,000 Khmer
 Muslim refugees but has not accepted non-Muslim refugees for
 permanent settlement. About 40,000 Philippine Muslims have
 permanently settled in Sabah since 1975, although they have
 not yet been offered citizenship.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Malaysia's parliamentary system is based on the British
 model. The Prime Minister and Cabinet are responsible to
 Parliament. Elections must be held at least once every 5
 years. The opposition concedes that elections to date have
 been free and fair; votes are cast secretly and recorded
 accurately.
 Through the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), Malays
 dominate the ruling National Front coalition of ethnic-based
 parties which has controlled Parliament since independence.
 Malays fill most important cabinet posts. The National Front
 parties benefit substantially from gerrymandered electoral
 districts. In April 1982 the National Front won 132 of the
 154 seats in the House of Representatives. Although the
 opposition regularly criticizes the Government in Parliament,
 it rarely succeeds in influencing legislation.
 
 
 829
 MALAYSIA
 Section 4   Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Malaysian Government is not a member of any international
 or regional human rights body. The Government was not the
 subject of resolutions, investigations, or other action by
 human rights organizations in 1985. Although Amnesty
 International has noted that most detainees held under the ISA
 have been released in recent years, a March 1985 summary of
 its concerns in Malaysia again criticized the Government for
 detention under this act and called for the unconditional
 release of specific "long-term" detainees. The Government has
 taken the position that Malaysia is the best and sole judge of
 its security needs and that the act will remain in effect. In
 its 1985 Report, Amnesty International also criticized
 conditions and treatment in Taiping detention camp and at
 interrogation and "rehabilitation" centers. Freedom House
 rates Malaysia as "partly free."
 There are no government or private organizations in Malaysia
 which deal specifically with protection of individual
 liberties. The bar council, a Muslim youth movement, and a
 social reform group all devote some time to the subject,
 usually in response to government actions they believe
 endanger civil liberties. The bar council also investigates
 some cases of possible violation of human rights, but more on
 an ad hoc basis than through set procedures.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The population of Malaysia in 1985 was reported to be
 approximately 15.3 million, and the population growth rate
 about 2.0 percent. Government policy encourages a high birth
 rate. Malaysia's abundant natural resources (tin, rubber,
 palm oil, petroleum, gas, and timber) have helped to make its
 economy one of the more prosperous ones in Asia for the last
 two decades. Manufacturing is on the rise, with textiles,
 electronic components, and other manufactures increasingly
 being exported. Gross national product per capita was
 estimated at $1,981 for 1984.
 In 1985 life expectancy at birth was 67.7 years and infant
 mortality about 25 deaths per 1,000 births. In 1980 an
 estimated 63 percent of the population had access to safe
 drinking water. The per capita calorie supply in 1982 met 120
 percent of nutritional requirements. Education is free,
 compulsory for 9 years, and available to all. The Government
 provides scholarships at special boarding schools and at
 universities abroad for gifted students, particularly Malays.
 The primary school enrollment ratio is 96 percent. The
 estimated adult literacy rate in 1980 was 72 percent.
 Various government regulations are designed to ensure that
 workers enjoy acceptable conditions of work. Work hours are
 not to exceed 8 hours per day or 48 hours per week, and
 vacation time must be granted. Factories must maintain
 minimum standards of industrial safety and insurance plans.
 Employers must provide severance pay and maintain a retirement
 fund. However, there is no minimum wage except in a few minor
 occupations.
 Plantation work is increasingly being done by contract
 workers, many of whom may be illegal immigrants from
 
 
 830
 MALAYSIA
 Indonesia. Working conditions for contract workers are
 significantly below those of direct hire plantation workers,
 many of whom belong to the National Union of Plantation
 Workers. Additionally, many of the immigrant workers,
 particularly the illegal ones, may not have access to
 Malaysia's excellent juridical labor system.
 Employment of children is covered by the Children and Young
 Persons (Employment) Act of 1966, which stipulates that no
 child under 14 may be engaged in any employment except light
 work in a family enterprise, in public entertainment, work
 performed by the Government in a school or training
 institution, or employment as an approved apprentice. It is
 illegal for children to work more than 6 hours per day or 6
 days per week, or at night.
 There are no restrictions on the political rights of Malaysian
 women. Government policy supports their full and equal
 participation in government, education, and the work force.
 The position of women in society is conditioned by the
 cultural and religious traditions of the country's major
 ethnic groups. With a general resurgence of Islamic piety
 among Malays, Malay women have in recent years tended toward
 close conformity with Koranic stipulations on women's roles.
 The Government implements on an extensive scale programs
 designed to boost the economic position of the ethnic Malay
 majority which remains poorer, on average, than other
 Malaysians despite its political dominance. As a result of
 these discriminatory government programs and policies,
 non-Malay opportunities for education, government employment,
 and ownership of new homesteads are limited. Virtually all
 institutions of higher learning are required to use the
 national language, Malay, as the medium of instruction for
 nontechnical courses.
