 CHINA
 The People's Republic of China (PRC) is ruled by the Chinese
 Communist Party (CCP), which sets political and economic
 policy and is the final arbiter of all social, cultural, and
 moral questions. Power within the party is shared among a
 small group of leaders in several key organizations, including
 the Politburo and its five-member Standing Committee, the
 Military Commission, and the Secretariat. Politburo Standing
 Committee member Deng Xiaoping is China's preeminent leader.
 Since achieving power in 1949, the CCP has continued China's
 long tradition of autocratic rule, justifying it by Leninist
 principles and strengthening it by use of the resources
 available to the modern state. The leadership now also
 exploits the popular desire for stability resulting from the
 1966-76 Cultural Revolution by equating any perceived threat
 to its control with a threat to social order that justifies a
 strong reaction. Since the late 1970's, the leadership has
 taken steps aimed at rejuvenating institutions ravaged by the
 Cultural Revolution, restoring party prestige among the
 population, and creating stability to facilitate economic
 growth. The legal system, abandoned during the Cultural
 Revolution, has been resurrected and is being strengthened.
 The authorities have promulgated many laws, including the
 first full-scale criminal law and criminal procedure code in
 the history of the People's Republic. However, the party
 continues to place significant restrictions on fundamental
 political and civil rights such as freedom of speech, the
 press, religion, association, and travel. The Government does
 not tolerate fundamental criticism of the CCP or the Socialist
 system, and deals swiftly and harshly with those who engage in
 such criticism.
 China is one of the world's poorer developing countries.
 However, its economy has shown rapid growth in the last
 several years as the result of the introduction of incentives
 rewarding good performance. As modernization of China's
 economy has progressed, the leadership has repudiated more and
 more aspects of the Soviet economic model, the basis on which
 China's Socialist economy was originally structured.
 The human rights situation in China improved marginally in
 1985, with only some movement toward realization of the 1982
 Constitution's formal guarantees of individual rights and a
 structure for dispersal of political power within the
 Government which, by implication of the preamble, remains
 subordinate to the party. While not relinquishing its
 decisionmaking power, the party has made a gesture towards
 broader participation in the political process through
 reinvigoration of the National People's Congress and the
 Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as well as
 by holding multiple-candidate elections to local
 representative bodies. The party has also changed Cultural
 Revolution policies which sought the destruction of religion
 in favor of a policy of limited toleration. Some growth in
 officially sanctioned religious activities has occurred,
 including return of, or compensation for, church properties,
 and there have been cautious contacts with foreign religious
 organizations.
 During 1985 a campaign to "strengthen the people's concept of
 rights" received moderate press coverage. Training programs
 were established for persons engaged in legal work, and there
 
 
 738
 CHINA
 were also programs to popularize knowledge of laws. However,
 significant areas of life remain basically unprotected by law.
 An extensive and frequently controversial family planning
 program is carried on under brief provisions in the
 Constitution, the marriage law, and various administrative and
 party fiats at national, provincial, and local levels.
 Implementation has varied widely from place to place.
 Although coercive family planning is contrary to official
 Chinese policy, there have been numerous reliable reports of
 coercive birth control practices, including forced abortions
 and sterilizations. Another apparent result of the
 Government's effort to limit most families to one child has
 been the resort by some persons who desire a male descendant
 to the traditional practice of female infanticide.
 An important part of China's evolution towards a less tightly
 controlled society is the leadership's policy of opening up to
 the outside world. The Government has made the promotion of
 foreign trade and investment an integral part of its
 modernization drive. Travel and emigration controls have been
 loosened significantly in recent years. Tens of thousands of
 Chinese go abroad every year to study, conduct business, or
 visit relatives, while millions of overseas Chinese and
 hundreds of thousands of other foreigners visit China. At the
 same time that it promotes China's opening to the outside, the
 party seeks to block unwelcome foreign influences. Chinese
 contacts with foreigners continue to be monitored by an
 extensive security apparatus.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 A crime suppression campaign launched in the fall of 1983
 continued in 1985, although at a less intensive level. The
 authorities claimed that the campaign had reduced the crime
 rate by 30 percent, and that it would continue through 1986.
 During this anticrime campaign, the death penalty has been
 applied frequently. The great majority of the 5,000-10,000
 persons estimated to have been executed since the crackdown on
 crime began were charged with serious nonpolitical crimes. As
 in 1983 and 1984, however, some of those executed in 1985 were
 charged with "counter-revolutionary" crimes (usually
 espionage).
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports in 1985 of persons being abducted or
 disappearing permanently at the hands of the security
 services. There has been no information, however, regarding
 some of the scores of dissidents arrested in the aftermath of
 the Democracy Wall movement in Beijing and elsewhere in 1979,
 and during a crackdown on unauthorized publications in 1981.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment
 or Punishment
 China's Code of Criminal Procedure specifically prohibits the
 use of torture. However, to indoctrinate the public and deter
 crime, the authorities sometimes subject persons convicted of
 
 
 739
 CHINA
 serious crimes to public denunciation and humiliation at "mass
 sentencing rallies." At these rallies, often attended by
 thousands of people (including the families and neighbors of
 the accused), the accused are denounced and their sentences
 revealed to the crowd. Policemen force prisoners to keep
 their heads bowed as a mark of contrition. "Mass sentencing
 rallies" were rare in 1985, but at least one report spoke of a
 person sentenced to die at a mass rally and being led to the
 execution grounds afterward. Another person at the same rally
 was sentenced to death with sentence suspended for 2 years.
 In such cases, the death sentence may be commuted to life
 imprisonment or less if the prisoner shows good behavior.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although Chinese law details a series of procedures to be
 observed in the handling of suspects, including use of arrest
 warrants and time limits for detention during investigation
 and trial, these safeguards are not always honored in
 practice. There is no provision for preventive detention.
 Other guarantees in the law include the right to counsel.
 However, a defense attorney normally does not enter a case
 until after the police and procurator have finished their
 investigation and the defendant has been formally charged.
 In July 1984 the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing
 Committee approved amendments extending the period of
 detention during investigation from 2 to 4 months and the time
 limit for trials from 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 months. In principle,
 these changes applied only to "serious" cases and required
 that extensions be approved by provincial procuratorates or
 courts. Since Standing Committee decisions in 1980 and 1981
 had granted temporary authority to provinces to set their own
 time limits, the NPC's action represented both a return to a
 national standard and a probable reduction in the time limits
 earlier specified by the provinces. The new regulations also
 authorized the use of bail for accused persons not considered
 "dangerous," but there have been no reports about its
 implementation, notwithstanding claims in the Chinese press
 that these amendments would "promote human rights." It
 remained unclear how strictly they would be enforced since
 detainees have been held indefinitely in the past despite
 existing legal limits.
 Sentencing to prison or labor reform usually entails
 participation in compulsory labor. Prison and labor reform
 camps are expected to be partially self-supporting if not
 operating at a profit.
 Under "labor education" provisions, those who commit "minor
 theft or fraud" or who have been expelled from their work
 units may be deprived of their civil liberties and subjected
 to "education through labor" for up to 4 years without trial.
 This nonjudicial sentencing procedure has been used frequently
 against political dissidents. Judgments are handed down by a
 public security office in consultation with representatives of
 local civil affairs units. The authorities made extensive use
 of this provision during the initial phases of the crime
 suppression campaign in 1983. In 1984 they continued to
 transfer more serious offenders (sentenced to "reform through
 labor") from prisons in coastal areas to labor camps in remote
 areas of Xinjiang and Qinghai. Even after they complete their
 sentences, most of these prisoners will be denied permission
 to return to their homes in the East and will be expected to
 
 
 740
 CHINA
 find employment and establish themselves as permanent
 residents of these underpopulated regions.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 China's judiciary is nominally independent but in practice
 follows party policy. Although there are presently no
 standing special political or security courts, the party has
 in the past stage-managed trials having political significance
 such as those involving prominent Cultural Revolution
 political figures.
 Most Chinese trials are essentially sentencing hearings where
 defense representatives plead for clemency for their clients
 whose guilt, with very few exceptions, is not contested. The
 trials are preceded by extensive pretrial investigation and
 corroboration of testimony, and it is assumed that any person
 brought to trial is guilty. Defendants in criminal cases may
 appeal both verdicts and sentences to the next higher court.
 Appeals have resulted in both stiffer and reduced sentences
 for the accused.
 The criminal procedure code requires that all trials be held
 in public, except those involving state secrets, juveniles,
 and "personal secrets." In practice, attendance at public
 trials requires an admission ticket obtained from
 organizations selected by the authorities. According to
 Amnesty International's 1984 special report on China, most
 trials of those it classifies as prisoners of conscience were
 held without advance notification of their families.
 No reliable figures exist for the number of political
 prisoners in China, nor are there sufficient data to make an
 accurate estimate. The Government denies that it has any
 political prisoners and insists that it imprisons only
 criminals and '"counter-revolutionaries." The latter group
 includes some who had no clear political motive in breaking
 the law, but whose offenses (such as jailbreak or attacks on
 public buildings) were nonetheless classified as
 "counter-revolutionary." Overall, the number of such
 prisoners has dropped since the late 1970's, with the
 "reversal of verdicts" (often initiated through extrajudicial
 channels) of hundreds of thousands of persons sentenced as
 "counter-revolutionaries" during the Cultural Revolution, and
 through natural attrition.
 However, total inmate population in labor camps and prisons
 has increased since the beginning of the anticrime campaign,
 as tens of thousands of common criminals and persons
 considered socially undesirable have been processed through
 the courts. Estimates of outside observers on the number of
 labor camp inmates range from 100,000 to 10 million. Because
 of the large numbers released in the aftermath of the Cultural
 Revolution, estimates on the lower end of the scale appear
 more plausible.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or
 Correspondence
 Extensive regulation of individual and family life is one of
 the distinctive features of the Chinese sociopolitical
 system. For most Chinese (particularly urban residents), life
 revolves around the work unit, which provides not only
 employment, but also housing, ration coupons, permission to
 
 
 741
 CHINA
 marry and have a child, and other aspects of ordinary life.
 The unit, along with personnel in "neighborhood committees,"
 monitors a person's attitude and behavior and may report
 suspicious activity to the authorities. The unit-is the
 party's-enforcer at the local level, but its considerable
 autonomy may also be used to ignore or obstruct directives
 from the top.
 Faced with one-fifth of the world's population squeezed onto 7
 percent of the world's arable land, China's leaders have made
 family planning a top national priority. They believe that
 economic modernization goals will be unattainable without a
 low birth rate, particularly given the current*:high number of
 females of childbearing age, traditionally high Chinese birth
 rates, and recent medical advances leading to longer
 life expectancies. To achieve its goal of limiting China's
 population to 1.2 billion in the year 2000, the Government is
 discouraging early marriage and promoting as an ideal a norm
 of one child per family, backed by a massive, grassroots
 institutional effort involving education, contraceptive
 counseling, free contraceptive devices, and economic and
 social incentives and disincentives.
 The authorities have instituted various controls on marriage
 and childbearing. The minimum age for marriage is 22 for men
 and 20 for women, high by world standards but lower than
 previous Chinese requirements. Each province sets guidelines
 for the desired number of children to.be born during the
 year. For instance, in border regions and minority areas,
 where population densities are low, governmental control is
 weak and traditional attitudes strong, population growth
 guidelines are looser, allowing a second and sometimes third
 child per family. In other areas, central guidelines are
 often translated into rigid quotas at the unit level.
 Couples who sign a pledge to have only one child get a number
 of incentives: free health care for the child, a 5 percent
 increase in their pensions, priority in housing, schooling,
 and medical treatment, and a monthly bonus of about $2.
 Couples who insist on having a second child reportedly have
 the right to do so in most cases. However, in addition to
 losing their monthly bonus, they may be required to repay any
 bonuses already received, and, in some instances, give up or
 return other benefits as well. Women are expected to apply
 for permission from their unit to have a child. Although
 contrary to announced central government policy, significant
 numbers of those becoming pregnant without permission are
 coerced into having abortions, even in the later stages of
 pregnancy. Authorities have recently clarified that after the
 sixth month of pregnancy abortions should not be performed,
 unless the health of the mother is endangered. Reported
 instances of family planning malpractice occur for the most
 part in less developed rural areas, where central guidelines
 have sometimes been translated into rigid quotas by local
 officials. Chinese authorities say they take measures against
 local officials who violate the Government's policy in this
 regard, but there have been few reports of punishment of such
 offenders. Guidelines for local-level family planning
 personnel have not been made public, nor have the limits, if
 any, on their authority. Chinese family planning officials
 have reiterated that the Chinese Government does not condone
 forced abortions or sterilizations, but admitted that
 coercion, even though counter to official policy, may occur in
 
 
 742
 CHINA
 some instances. Chinese officials have claimed that abortion
 ends about 25-33 percent of pregnancies. Infanticide is
 illegal, and the press has published cases of persons punished
 for infanticide.
 Although contacts between Chinese.and foreigners have
 increased considerably, the authorities closely scrutinize
 such association. Chinese citizens whose work does not
 require or permit contact with foreigners may be warned or
 detained and questioned if they persist in meeting foreign
 acquaintances. On the other hand, Chinese seem less hesitant
 than in the recent past to strike up conversations with
 foreigners. "English corners," where Chinese and foreigners
 can meet to talk in English, have appeared in public places.
 The authorities in principle permit marriages between
 foreigners and Chinese but specifically prohibit Chinese
 citizens involved in confidential and other "important" work
 (such as diplomats and military personnel), as well as those
 serving prison sentences, from marrying foreigners. In
 practice, romantic liaisons between Chinese citizens and
 foreigners are strongly discouraged.
 The Criminal Procedure Code requires the use of search
 warrants for gathering evidence. There is no reliable
 information on whether this proviso is carried out in
 practice. There were reports several years ago of the use of
 electronic eavesdropping equipment to monitor suspected
 political dissidents.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and the press,
 but in practice open criticism of the CCP or Chinese socialism
 is not permitted. The party's policy of carefully controlling
 the print and broadcast media was restated in a 1985 speech by
 party General Secretary Hu Yaobang who said "Journalism work
 is the party's mouthpiece." Degrees of control vary from
 absolute, in the case of party organs such as the People's
 Daily, to "guided," for specialized publications dealing with
 nonpolitical topics. With party sanction, newspapers
 routinely publish "letters to the editor" and feature articles
 exposing incompetence or corruption by low- or middle-ranking
 officials.
 In place of the earlier "spiritual pollution" campaign, by the
 latter part of 1985 authorities were stressing a theme of
 building a Socialist "spiritual civilization." This seems to
 be a positive attempt to build morale, encourage high
 standards of personal and public behavior, and avoid one-sided
 overemphasis on seeking personal profit. Associated with this
 was a crackdown on apparently widespread tabloids, smuggled
 pornographic publications and videotapes, and cadres who
 engaged in corrupt or questionable business deals, including
 use of false trademarks and improper use of authority or
 connections. A national writers' conference held in Beijing
 in late December 1984 promised greater creative freedom. At
 the conference, a CCP official criticized excessive party
 interference in literary affairs and said that writers must be
 free to choose their subjects and ways of expression, though
 he also made it clear that criticism of the social system
 would remain off-limits.
 
 
 743
 CHINA
 Despite official distrust of foreign influence, the leadership
 has permitted greater, albeit still limited, access to various
 aspects of foreign culture. More foreign books and artistic
 works are available now than in past years, foreign films are
 shown more frequently, and visits by foreign artistic groups
 have become more common. Selected subscribers in universities
 and other institutions receive foreign periodicals. Tens of
 millions of Chinese read the Reference News, an officially
 controlled selection of largely uncensored translations from
 the foreign press. Coverage of foreign news in the open media
 has become more extensive and professional. Chinese listen
 freely to foreign broadcasts, and many universities use the
 Voice of American (VOA) and other foreign radio broadcasts in
 their language courses. Contrary to earlier practice, there
 is no jamming. In its weekly programming, Chinese television
 includes some programs from Western and other countries.
 Audiences in some major cities enjoy Chinese-language
 renditions of classical and contemporary Western plays.
 b.   Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of peaceful assembly and
 association; in practice, however, the authorities
 circumscribe these rights. China has a wide variety and
 increasing number of professional and other associations, such
 as the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Women's
 Federation, the Chinese Writers' Association, and the
 All-China Sports Federation. These groups operate under party
 control. The authorities suppress groups which attempt to
 function independently.
 China's trade unions are closely controlled by the CCP. The
 All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) is the umbrella
 organization with which all trade unions must affiliate. With
 over 74 million members, the ACFTU enrolls about two-thirds of
 the urban work force. The Federation's prime function is to
 serve the State's interest by promoting labor discipline,
 enhancing labor productivity, conducting political and
 ideological indoctrination, and improving workers' educational
 and technical skills. Unions also perform a variety of social
 and welfare functions such as operating clubs, eating
 facilities, nurseries, schools, and sanatoriums. Their duties
 also include the promotion of workers' safety. Although
 government officials may consult trade union leaders on wage
 policy, unions have no power to engage in collective
 bargaining.
 Chinese workers are not guaranteed the right to strike.
 Included in the 1978 State Constitution, this right was
 omitted in the 1982 revision as well as in the 1983 trade
 union constitution. However, a trade union spokesman said in
 1983 that this omission did not necessarily mean that strikes
 were illegal. He then described a narrow range of
 circumstances (e.g., workers' safety at risk) where strikes
 might be permitted for a brief time. There are no known
 instances of strikes on these issues.
 In the last several years, the ACFTU has moved actively to
 expand its international ties. Claiming to have contacts with
 trade unions in over 120 countries or regions, the Federation
 has stated its desire to establish links with foreign unions
 regardless of their affiliation with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions, the Soviet-dominated World
 Federation of Trade Unions, or other organizations. The
 
 
 744
 CHINA
 ACFTU's busiest bilateral program is with the Japanese labor
 federations Domei and Sohyo. Since China activated its
 membership in the International Labor Organization (ILO) in
 1983, an ACFTU official has served as China's workers'
 delegate to that body. This representative was elected to an
 alternate seat on the ILO Governing Body in 1984. The ILO
 opened a regional office in Beijing in January 1985.
 Since 1981, workers' congresses have been established in most
 of China's large and medium-sized enterprises. Created in
 principle to permit workers a role in enterprise management
 and selection of plant officials, the congresses have to date
 been largely quiescent. The October 1984 Party Plenum's
 decision on economic reform, while calling for "centralized
 and unilateral leadership" of enterprises and "strict labor
 discipline," also says that worker participation in management
 must be ensured, but no specific steps to accomplish this have
 yet been announced.
 c.   Freedom of Religion
 Reversing Cultural Revolution-era attempts to eliminate all
 religious practice, China's reformist leadership changed in
 1978 to a policy of limited religious toleration. The
 Constitution guarantees freedom of religious belief and
 specifies that no organization or person may compel citizens
 to believe or disbelieve in religion or discriminate against
 them because of religious preference. The Constitution also
 provides that religious bodies must not be subject to foreign
 domination. Aside from these provisions, official policy
 forbids religious proselytizing outside places of worship or
 believers' homes. Earlier, unpublished regulations reportedly
 also limited religious freedom to those over 18, but church
 associations denied this in 1985.
 The authorities have required all religious bodies to
 affiliate with eight national organizations representing four
 religions--Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, and Daoism. Of the
 five Christian associations, two are Protestant (the
 Protestant Three Self Movement and the China Christian
 Council), and three are Catholic (the Patriotic Catholic
 Association, the National Administrative Council of the
 Catholic Church, and the Catholic Bishops College). Together,
 these associations--with different functional responsibilities
 but overlapping leaderships--constitute the officially
 sanctioned national Protestant and Catholic Churches.
 Although all Protestant denominations were required to merge
 in the 1950's, congregations and individuals may follow
 preferences on such matters as forms of baptism. Since its
 separation from Rome 30 years ago, the Chinese Catholic Church
 has developed an independent theology and doctrines; for
 example, it rejects Papal infallibility, continues to conduct
 services in Latin, and supports the State's policy on birth
 control, provided church-approved methods are used. These
 five Christian associations and three organizations
 representing the other religions ensure that religious bodies
 accept the leadership of the State and party.
 Within the limits of official policy, religieus-activities
 have expanded considerably in the last few years. Many
 religious institutions which were closed during the Cultural
 Revolution have reopened. In 1985 officials said there were
 2,600 churches and over 20,000 mosques in service in the
 country. Many Buddhist and Daoist temples have reopened,
 
 
 745
 CHINA
 often after being refurbished at government expense. In
 Tibet, nearly 500 Lamaistic monasteries have been restored,
 many with government funds--still just a fraction of the 2,700
 monasteries open before the Chinese suppression of the 1959
 Tibetan uprising. Similarly, only a small number of monks
 have returned to monastic life in Tibet, although more are
 being trained at a government-funded institute in Lhasa. In
 Sichuan a reported 550 lamaseries were reopened.
 Since 1981 the authorities have permitted the establishment of
 seminaries to train a limited number of young people in
 religious orders. The Catholic Church has seven seminaries
 and three minor seminaries in operation. The Protestant
 church, apart from its national seminary in Nanjing, operates
 nine other theological institutes, the newest in Shanghai. In
 June, the Nanjing Theological Seminary held its first
 graduation since reopening in 1981, with 95 graduates, who
 will go to Protestant churches in different parts of China.
 The Islamic Association operates a National Theological
 Institute in Beijing, and another Islamic Institute opened in
 Ningxia in September 1985, with an initial enrollment of 20.
 The Buddhist Association has institutes in Beijing, Suzhou,
 and Nanjing, as well as Lhasa. The religious associations
 publish a variety of religious materials for believers,
 including scriptures, teaching material, theological journals,
 and hymnbooks. Since 1980, for example, the Protestant China
 Christian Council has printed and distributed over 1.3 million
 Bibles. Aside from appropriating funds for extensive
 renovation of temples, the Government provides other forms of
 direct and indirect financial support for religious bodies
 (e.g., tax exemptions for their rental income and cash
 subsidies to Muslims for observance of dietary law).
 The number of Christians has increased since 1978, with
 estimates ranging from the official figure of 6 million to a
 more likely 10-20 million. This increase in believers has
 resulted in a severe shortage of places of worship, given the
 continued occupation of many pre-Cultural Revolution churches
 and temples by factories, the military, and other units. As a
 result, many congregations are forced to meet in believers'
 homes. Officials say there are 15 million actively practicing
 Muslims and that practitioners of Buddhism and Daoism run into
 the millions. Because the older generation of religious
 leaders is slowly dying off, and the number of recent
 graduates of religious training institutions is still
 inadequate, there is a pressing shortage of priests,
 ministers, monks, and imams.
 Despite the greater freedom of recent years, the authorities
 still react harshly to unsanctioned religious activity. Some
 Christians prefer to worship outside the officially recognized
 "patriotic" church system and instead meet in unsanctioned
 "house churches." The public security authorities have in the
 past harassed these underground churches with measures
 including arrests in an attempt to force worshipers into an
 official church. In 1983, there were reports of arrests of 30
 "house church" leaders in central China, 100 Christians in
 Henan province, and 2 ethnic Koreans active in the evangelical
 church movement in Shanghai. There have been no recent
 reports of harassment of "house church" leaders or
 congregations. In 1983 the NPC Standing Committee authorized
 the death penalty for those organizing secret sects which
 spread "feudal and superstitious ideas." However, this
 
 
 CHINA
 provision did not appear aimed at mainstream religious
 activities, but rather at traditional animist and cult
 practices or plain criminal activity.
 Because of concern over divided loyalties, the authorities
 carefully monitor and control contacts between Chinese and
 foreign religious organizations. On the one hand, they
 encourage Chinese religious leaders to meet foreign
 counterparts and take part in international meetings. In
 1985, for example, the Chinese Buddhist Association and the
 Indian Embassy sponsored a photo exhibition on Sakyamuni, the
 founder of Buddhism, in a Beijing temple, attended by 250
 monks and nuns from Beijing and an Indian Buddhist
 delegation. In addition, a Hungarian church delegation
 visited Protestant churches in China. To gain support from
 important minority groups and create goodwill with Islamic
 nations, China in 1979 resumed giving permission to Muslim
 citizens to make the Hajj. Over 2,100 Chinese made the
 pilgrimage to Mecca in 1985, nearly double the 1984 figure.
 There are some indications that Chinese religious
 organizations may again be permitted to receive funds or gifts
 from foreign religious organizations--if no strings are
 attached.
 On the other hand, the Government insists that the country's
 religious bodies must be independent of foreign control and
 warns against foreign attempts to interfere in Chinese
 religious affairs. The Government prohibits missionaries from
 practicing among Chinese citizens but has allowed some foreign
 clergymen to enter for brief periods to serve the resident
 foreign community. Foreigners with acknowledged ties to
 overseas religious institutions are permitted to work in
 China, often as English teachers, with the understanding that
 they not engage in open proselytizing of their beliefs.
 The authorities' principal concern with alleged foreign
 interference lies with the Vatican. Relations continue to be
 estranged because of Rome's recognition of the Taiwan
 authorities as the "Republic of China" and because the
 officially sanctioned Chinese church does not recognize the
 *Vatican's authority. Chinese priests who maintain their
 loyalty to the Pope are subject to arrest and imprisonment.
 The most recent case occurred in late 1983 when a provincial
 court sentenced the 76-year-old Bishop of Baoding, Peter
 Joseph Fan Xueyan, and his 70-year-old Vicar-General,
 Monsignor Hua Binzhang, to 10 years' imprisonment for
 maintaining links with the Vatican. Gong Pinmei, former
 Bishop of Shanghai and a prominent Catholic clergyman loyal to
 Rome, incarcerated since 1955, was released in July 1985.
 d.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel within China is subject to various formal and informal
 restrictions. Chinese citizens must have a written letter of
 introduction from their work unit to buy airplane tickets,
 secure hotel accommodations, or acquire ration coupons for
 purchase of basic food items in areas outside their places of
 residence. Those traveling by rail who plan to stay with
 relatives need not obtain letters of introduction but are
 still required to register with local police during their
 visits. With their higher income levels (particularly in the
 countryside), Chinese are traveling ever more frequently
 
 
 747
 CHINA
 within the country, sometimes ignoring these bureaucratic
 requirements without much difficulty. This increased mobility
 prompted the authorities, out of concern for social order and
 public security, to announce in April 1985 the adoption of the
 country's first nationwide identity card system. This plan
 went into effect on September 6, 1985 under the auspices of
 the NPC Standing Committee. Local committees are working out
 details for eventual implementation.
 Chinese citizens cannot freely change their locality of
 residence or workplace. They are registered as residents of a
 particular jurisdiction. The authorities normally grant
 permission to move to another locality only for a change in
 employment. In practice, rigid personnel policies, most
 notably the unwillingness of units to sanction an employee's
 transfer, make it difficult to change jobs. The authorities
 have called for and taken some steps towards reform of the
 personnel system, aiming at greater mobility among scientists,
 technicians, and certain other professionals. As part of
 efforts to develop commerce and industry in rural areas, the
 State Council issued a circular in October 1984 which
 authorized peasants to establish business in rural towns.
 Strict policies restricting rural-to-urban migration continue.
 With the relaxation of controls on foreign travel and
 emigration since the late 1970's, tens of thousands of Chinese
 now go overseas every year to study, conduct business, or
 visit relatives. The trend toward looser controls continued
 in 1985. The Government announced that the number of state-
 financed students sent abroad would be increased by 1,000 to
 4,000 in 1985. Some of the restrictions applicable to
 students able to secure financial support for studies abroad
 from nongovernmental sources were abolished. The trend
 towards looser controls on foreign travel notwithstanding,
 Chinese cannot go abroad as a matter of right. In November
 1985 the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
 passed the "Citizens Exit and Entry Control Law," due to go
 into effect February 1, 1986. The law states: "A Chinese
 citizen may leave, or enter, the territory without visa
 processing by showing a valid passport, or other valid
 certificates..." With some exceptions, "all applications for
 exit on account of personal affairs.. .will be approved." The
 law will deny exit to four categories of people--those
 involved in unsettled criminal or civil cases, serving
 sentences, placed under "education through labor," or whose
 exit may harm China's national security or interests. Under
 the law, Chinese citizens living overseas will no longer need
 a visa to enter China. Chinese permitted to leave the country
 are allowed to return. China relaxed restrictions on internal
 travel by foreigners in February 1985 by more than doubling
 the number of areas (cities and counties) open to foreign
 visitors without special permission. Several additional areas
 have been opened since then, including some suburban areas
 around Beijing. At present just over 100 cities or counties
 are open to visitors, including all of China's largest cities,
 and another 150-plus areas are open but require first
 obtaining special travel permits. Nevertheless, about 90
 percent of Chinese counties and cities remain officially
 closed.
 China does not revoke the citizenship of political
 dissidents. The authorities have welcomed the return for
 permanent residence of Chinese who had fled their homeland
 
 
 CHINA
 earlier in fear of Communist rule; such persons are also
 welcomed back for brief visits or to establish residence. An
 estimated 10 million overseas Chinese, including some
 political opponents and former refugees from the regime,
 visited China in 1984; the number of foreign visitors not of
 Chinese ancestry has also increased dramatically in recent
 years. More than 270,000 refugees and displaced persons from
 Vietnam and Laos have resettled in China since 1978. The
 number of new arrivals has dropped to around 100 per month.
 The authorities have also resettled over 2,000 ethnic Chinese
 permanent residents of the Mongolian People's Republic since
 1983, after they were expelled by that country's Government.
 There were no known cases of forced repatriation of refugees,
 nor have the authorities sought to obstruct voluntary
 repatriation or resettlement abroad by refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The CCP is the paramount source of political authority and
 decisionmaking in the country. Within the party, power is
 divided among a group of top leaders in several key
 organizations, including the Politburo and its five-member
 Standing Committee, the Military Commission, and the
 Secretariat. Under the doctrine of "Democratic Centralism,"
 leaders at the top, after consultation within the party, make
 policy decisions which all party members are expected to
 support. Political debate and conflict usually take place
 only before a decision is made; once announced, all party
 members are expected to follow the party line. Nevertheless,
 there are means by which party members and others can debate
 established policies. These include the presentation of
 alternate points of view or criticism through thinly veiled
 allusions in the party-controlled press, the use of academic
 journals to present differing views on supposedly theoretical
 matters, selective enforcement of policies, exploitation of
 policy ambiguities, manipulation of news coverage, and
 informal and unpublicized debate at party and government
 meetings. In 1985, however, Chinese economists and political
 theoreticians openly debated in academic journals and a
 national newspaper a key national issue--the limits of
 economic reform. Parties or groups which oppose the CCP are
 forbidden.
 Over the past five years, however, the CCP has promoted a
 modest rejuvenation of eight "democratic" parties (formed
 before 1949) as agents of its "United Front" policy.
 Admittedly subservient to the CCP, the parties function as
 channels through which the authorities seek to mobilize
 support among various constituencies the parties claim to
 represent: intellectuals, former industrialists, returned
 overseas Chinese, former KMT (Nationalist Party, the dominant
 party of Taiwan) military and civilian officials, and
 Taiwanese living on the mainland. As part of its efforts to
 give more visibility to these parties, the CCP increased their
 representation in the NPC and at the Chinese People's
 Political Consultative Conference in 1983, and they have been
 allowed to reestablish party newspapers and to recruit new
 members. Although the CCP periodically consults with the
 representatives of these minor parties on important issues,
 the parties, whose membership totals only 120,000, and whose
 leaders are superannuated, have little discernible impact.
 The NPC meets once a year for about two weeks to debate and
 
 
 749
 CHINA
 approve government policies and personnel changes determined
 in advance by the CPP. The NPC has never rejected a
 government policy, although some have been modified as a
 result of delegates' concerns expressed behind the scenes.
 More important than the NPC as a whole is its Standing
 Committee, which meets several times a year and has the power
 to approve laws.
 Women have scored few breakthroughs in the male-dominated
 political establishment. At present, none of the 20 full
 members of the Politburo is female (although an alternate
 member is female), while just three women serve among the 45
 ministers and commission directors in the central Government.
 About 20 percent of NPC delegates are female. At present
 there is one female provincial governor and one female
 provincial party secretary.
 Minority ethnic groups--who account for 6.7 percent of the
 population and are concentrated in border areas like Xinjiang,
 Tibet, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Inner Mongolia--are permitted a
 limited degree of autonomy. At its 1984 plenary session, the
 NPC adopted a national minorities law, essentially a
 compilation of post-Cultural Revolution policies and practices
 with few new departures. Like the State Constitution, the new
 law provides that government heads of autonomous regions,
 prefectures, or countries should be members of the locally
 prevalent minority. Although vague on the extent of political
 autonomy for minority areas, the law clearly sets forth their
 rights to enjoy and develop their own cultural traditions, use
 their own language, and practice their own religion. CCP
 policies have reportedly been designed to increase minority
 representation in the Government and party in minority areas
 to levels reflecting the minority's share of the population,
 and to assign senior positions to minority persons.
 Nevertheless, the great majority of party first secretaries in
 the autonomous regions as well as some other key officers are
 Han Chinese.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 China has not been the subject of human rights investigations
 by official international organizations. There are no known
 organizations within China which monitor or comment on human
 rights conditions. The Chinese regard their human rights
 record as an internal matter, and see no justification for
 foreign concern about it. However, Chinese officials have
 been increasingly willing to meet with U.S. Government
 officials and members of professional groups to discuss birth
 control policies, and they have provided increasing amounts of
 information, including statistical data and visits to
 localities. In its 1985 Report, Amnesty International noted
 that its principal concerns with regard to China were the
 extensive use of the death penalty and the continued
 imprisonment of prisoners of conscience. Freedom House rated
 China as "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 One of the poorer developing countries, with a 1983 per capita
 gross national product (GNP) of $300 and a population of 1.04
 billion, China has nonetheless experienced rapid economic
 
 
 750
 CHINA
 growth in recent years. In 1983, national income rose by 9
 percent. The official cost-of-living index rose by 2 percent
 in 1983, although many foreign observers believe the rate may
 have been closer to 10 percent. Urban employment and
 unemployment are a serious problem, particularly among youth.
 The rapid growth in the number of lower-level collectives
 (production units owned by employees) and of the self-employed
 has helped to alleviate unemployment. Together, these two
 categories of workers accounted for 56 percent of the 1983
 increase in urban employment, although the state sector
 (accounting for 75 percent of the urban work force) remains
 dominant. The CCP announced a new "urban economic reform
 program" at the Central Committee's October 1984 plenum,
 intended to introduce market mechanisms into China's state
 sector. Based on the success of earlier agricultural reforms,
 the new reform plan envisions a relaxation of direct state
 control over the industrial sector, and greater reliance on
 small-scale collective and private enterprise in the
 commercial and service sectors. In theory, the State will
 move from direct administrative control on the Soviet-model
 toward a new mixture of "administrative guidance" and
 macroeconomic fiscal and financial signals, including tax and
 credit rate adjustments. Chinese leaders have emphasized that
 the economy will remain Socialist, but, if carried out as
 planned in outline, the new policies will move China towards a
 more decentralized economy with greater scope for market
 forces and individual initiative. The "urban economic reform
 program" would also lead to increased prices and wages as well
 as to increasing disparities in personal incomes, a
 controversial process which has already begun.
 China's billion-plus people-enjoy health care and nutrition at
 a level much higher than is typical for low-income countries.
 State-provided medical services are available widely at little
 or no cost to the user. Invalids receive public help often
 not provided by low-income countries. High rates of early
 death from rampant infectious, parasitic, and respiratory
 diseases, and high rates of infant mortality, have been
 dramatically lowered. The 1982 infant mortality rate varied
 from 13 per 1,000 live births in the cities to 22 per 1,000 in
 the countryside. Life expectancy is 68 years, above the world
 average. Regional variation in life expectancy ranges from 72
 years in some northern and eastern cities and provinces
 (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Liaoning) to 59 in the
 southwest (Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan). China's leading
 causes of death now are heart disease, strokes, and cancer,
 the same as in high-income countries.
 China's current food situation is very unusual for a
 low-income country, and reflects a recent break with a long
 historical pattern. Total food intake, in terms of both
 protein and calories, is above the average for middle-income
 countries, although the proportion of animal products in the
 Chinese diet remains similar to the low-income country
 average. From a historical situation in which food provision
 hovered around subsistence levels, China has made recent
 progress in feeding its population, due to the post-1979 surge
 in Chinese agricultural production. However, standards remain
 significantly better in urban areas than in the countryside,
 and better in coastal provinces than inland.
 With 94 percent of eligible children enrolled in the first
 year of primary school, China is progressing toward its goal
 
 
 751
 CHINA
 of universal 9 years of compulsory education by 1990. The
 quality of rural education, which mainly consists of primary
 education, lags far behind that available in the cities.
 Furthermore, rural primary and secondary school enrollment
 ratios remain low, especially in poor areas. This problem
 has been aggravated in recent years by decollectivization,
 with many rural families keeping their children out of school
 to work on family farms, and by rising school fees in some
 areas. Recent government efforts have begun to reverse this
 situation. However, from a high point of 46 percent in 1979,
 by the mid-1980's secondary school enrollment nationwide had
 dropped to about 30 percent, below the developing-country
 average of 39 percent. Only about 5 percent of high school
 graduates attend college. The 1982 census placed adult
 literates (defined as persons knowing more than 1,500 Chinese
 characters) at 76.9 percent of the population.
 While there is no legislation which establishes a minimum age
 for employment, state enterprises in practice will not hire
 anyone who is not a high school graduate or lacks equivalent
 certification. Employment standards in the countryside,
 however, are hard to monitor and may be considerably more
 lax. Schools try to schedule some sort of "productive"
 activity as part of the curriculum, and children in rural
 areas often help out in farm activities. In the course of
 trying to universalize a system of compulsory 9 years'
 education, the Government is attempting to close off full-time
 employment opportunities (and thus the temptation to drop out
 of school)-for those who have not finished minimum schooling.
 Conditions of work vary widely. In some impoverished areas,
 long toilsome hours do not return even a bare living, and
 subsidies are required for survival. There is no minimum wage
 law. The Government is attempting to encourage productivity
 in state and collective enterprises, encouraging
 experimentation with various incentive systems.
 The Constitution endorses the principle that all citizens are
 equal. In the socioeconomic realm as in politics, however,
 women lag behind men despite progress in recent years. Female
 participation in the labor force has increased rapidly in
 recent years, reaching 36.5 percent of urban workers in 1983.
 Yet, women are concentrated in sectors such as light industry,
 where wage rates are lower. Despite increased educational
 opportunities, the percentage of females in school drops from
 43 in primary grades to 26.2 percent of all students in
 universities; 70 percent of illiterates are women.
 Notwithstanding stiff punishment and official discouragement,
 selling of women and other traditional practices, such as
 arranged marriages and heavy dowries, continue to be reported
 from time to time.
 Minorities have benefited from the party's more liberal
 programs for them, which include special treatment in marriage
 and family planning, employment, and university admission.
 Nonetheless, the standard of living of minorities--many of
 whom live in poor, remote areas--remains below that of most
 Han Chinese. Social and other discrimination against former
 opponents of the CCP, intellectual critics of party
 leadership, and former capitalists has been significantly
 curtailed in recent years.
 The leadership's liberalization of political, economic, and
 social policies towards Tibet was reiterated by a February
 
 
 752
 CHINA
 1984 forum convened by the Secretariat. One result has been
 the rehabilitation of many members of former Tibetan
 .aristocratic families, whose property is being restored, and
 who are given figurehead positions in the Tibetan regional
 government. Three representatives of the Dalai Lama visited
 Beijing during October and November 1984 to discuss a possible
 visit by the exiled spiritual leader. At the conclusion of
 their-vlsit, the representatives issued a statement ruling out
 a 1985 visit by the Dalai Lama to Tibet, but leaving open the
 possibility of a trip to other parts of China, including areas
 where =ethnic Tibetans live. These discussions took place
 against the background of arrests and executions in 1983 of
 some Tibetans, which the Dalai Lama's representatives said
 included-political dissidents. The Chinese Government denied
 these allegations, saying the arrests and executions were part
 of a nationwide crackdown on common crime.
