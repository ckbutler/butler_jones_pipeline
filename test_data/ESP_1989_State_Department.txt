 Spain is a parliamentary democracy with a constitutional
 monarch, Juan Carlos I. In free and open parliamentary
 elections in October, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez was
 elected to a third term. The fundamental rights of speech,
 assembly, press, religion, movement, and participation in the
 political process are guaranteed in the Constitution of 1978
 and are respected in practice.
 The security forces are under the full control of the
 Government. This was last demonstrated in 1988 when three
 police officers were each sentenced to 29 years in prison for
 their role in the 1983 disappearance and presumed death of a
 prisoner.
 The Spanish economy is mixed, with primary reliance on private
 in'tiative and market mechanisms. Spain continues to
 experience high unemployment, although the economy Is growing
 and unemployment dropped in August to its lowest .level since
 October 1983. High unemployment is due in part to the entry
 of new workers into the labor force. Women and youth are
 disproportionately affected by the high level of unemployment.
 In 1989 the human rights'situation continued-to be dominated
 by the protracted campaign of terrorism waged by the Basque
 separatist group ETA (Basque Fatherland and Freedom). The  --
 Government continued its efforts to bring individual
 terrorists to justice while adhering to democratic standards
 of due process and civil rights. Suspected terrorists
 arrested and charged with crimes frequently assert that they
 were abused by police. In 1989 there were no confirmed cases
 of police abuse.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political arid Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were approximately 42 terrorist-related incidents from
 January through September 1989 in which'12 people were killed
 and 18 injured.* Of those killed, five were Spanish National
 Police,. one a civil guard, three military-personnel, and three
 civilians. All of the deaths and most'of-the injuries
 occurred during actions claimed by or attributable to ETA. In
 July ETA shot to death two military officers as they drove
 down a-street in Madrid.' In September, also in Madrid, ETA
 gunmen assassinated a public prosecutor'involved in the cases
 of several ETA terrorist suspects. Several days later, two
 ETA members were killed in an armed confrontation with members
 of the Guardia Civil. In a subsequent series of raids and
 arrests, Spanish authorities claimed to have effectively
 dismantled the "Araba Command,, one'of ETA's most violent
 cells. In September two civil guards were gravely %ounded in
 a bomb attack on their barracks in Gerona by the Catalan
 *separatist group Terra Lliure.
 The Government held intermittent talks with ETA in Algeria
 during the past several years in an attempt to end the
 violence. The talks broke down in early 1989, however. On
 April 7, a 3-month truce by ETA effectively came to an end
 when the group set off a series of bombs. Since then, ETA has
 continued an intermittent campaign of bombings. Since 1987
 there has been close and effective cooperation between the
 
 
 1244
 Spanish and French Governments in the fight against ETA
 terrorism.
 Two ranking police officers arc in prison awaiting trial on
 charges that they organized a secret antiterrorist    -
 assassination band, the Antiterrorist Liberation Group (GAL),
 which took credit for the killings of alleged Spanish Basque
 terrorists in Southern France from 1983 to 1986. They were
 arrested in May 1988. The delay in bringing the two policemen
 to trial is not unusual for a criminal case. The law provides
 for maximum imprisonment of 2 years before trial.
 b. Disappearance
 Kidnapings for ransom are occasionally carried out by ETA.
 There are no claims that police or government security forces
 carried out secret arrests or kidnapings.
 .c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were no documented instances of police abuse during
 1989, although ETA detainees routinely charge that they are
 abused during detention. An improved police attitude with
 respect to human rights over the past several years may be
 attributed to enhanced police discipline, the willingness of
 the Government to punish improper police behavior, publicity
 in the press, and concern by the police unions themselves with
 denunciations of police misconduct.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Constitution, a person is free from arbitrary arrest
 and detention, and normally a suspect may not be held more
 than 72 hours without a hearing. The Penal Code, as reformed
 in 1988, permits a suspected terrorist to be held an additional
 2 days without a hearing.
 Exile is not practiced in Spain. With regard to forced or
 compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e.  Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary and the
 right to a fair public trial. This right is observed in
 practice. Defendants have the right to be represented by an
 attorney, at state expense for the indigent. The right to be
 released on bail is guaranteed, unless the court has reason to
 believe a suspect may flee or constitute a serious threat to
 public safety. The law provides for an expeditious judicial
 hearing following arrest. Suspects may not-be imprisoned for
 more than 2 years before being brought to trial. In practice,
 the delay generally is less than 1 year. In cases of petty
 crime, suspects released on bail may face a wait of as long as
 5 years before their trial comes up. Following a conviction,
 defendants may always appeal to the next highest court. The
 European Court of Human Rights is the final arbiter in cases
 concerning human rights..
 f.. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution protects the privacy of the home and
 correspondence. Under-the Criminal Code, government
 authorities must obtain court approval before searching
 
 
 1245
 SPIN
 private property, wiretapping, or interfering with private
 correspondence. The present antiterrorist law gives
 discretionary authority to the Minister of Interior to act
 prior to obtaining court approval "in cases of emergency."
 There have been no complaints that the Minister has abused
 this authority.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government scrupulously observes the guarantees of free
 speech and press provided for in the Constitution. Opposition
 viewpoints are freely expressed in speech and through the
 media. In 1989 the Government approved a law allowing three
 new private television stations to begin broadcasts.
 b. Freedofi of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 As provided in the Constitution, all groups have the right of
 free assembly and association for political or other
 purposes. This right is fully respected and freely practiced.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Spain. Roman Catholicism is the
 predominant religion, but other religions are represented and
 function with full freedom. Adherence to a particular faith
 neither enhances nor diminishes a person's status.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Spanish citizens have complete freedom to travel within and
 outside the country. The Government restricts neither
 emigration nor repatriation. The law on aliens permits
 detention of a person for up to 40 days prior to expulsion but
 specifies that the detention may not take place in a
 prison-like setting, Spain has a liberal refugee law.
 Generally, the Government grants refugee status on the
 recommendation of the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Spain is a multiparty democracy with open elections in which
 all citizens over the age of 18 have the right to vote. At
 all levels of government, elections must be held every
 4 years. Opposition parties and groups take an active part in
 the political process.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government cooperates readily with international human
 rights- groups, such as Amnesty International and the
 International Committee of the Red Cross, as well as with
 independent national groups, such as the Spanish Human Rights
 Association. The Foreign Ministry, through an Office of Human
 
 
 1246
 SAINl
 Rights Affairs, takes an active interest in human rights
 issues internationally.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based. on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for equal rights for all citizens.
 Education and economic and social services are generally
 available to all without discrimination of any kind. An
 independent ombudsman actively investigates complaints of
 human rights abuses by the authorities. The Constitution
 promises equal rights to women, and the Government has
 indicated its intent to eliminate discrimination against women
 wherever it occurs.
 The Women's Institute, a government agency under the Ministry
 of Social Affairs, actively promotes social equality, women's
 mobility, and the participation of women in political,
 cultural, economic, and social life. However, traditional
 attitudes result in de facto discrimination against women in a
 number of areas.
 The Government and the largest labor union confederation are
 actiye in trying to increase public awareness of sexual
 harassment as a problem in the workplace. In February the
 Government passed a law making it easier for women to file
 charges of sexual harassment. The Government also funded a
 project to develop new schoolteaching materials designed to
 eliminate sexually stereotyped job roles.
 The Government has identified domestic violence against women,
 especially wife beating, as a social problem. The Women's
 Institute reports that, in 1988, 14,711 complaints were filed
 by women against their husbands and that 11,060 of these
 complaints involved charges of physical abuse. Spanish law
 treats wife beating as a form of assault and battery.
 Punishment is accordingly meted out according to damage done.
 In 1987 a law was passed recognizing the concept of marital
 rape. This law took effect in 1988.
 Several levels of government provide a number of institutional
 remedies, such as shelters for battered women. The Government
 also is attempting through education to change public
 attitudes that contribute to violence against women. The
 Women's Institute has charged that some judges are reluctant
 to get involved in what they feel should remain a domestic
 problem. Similarly, in smaller towns some police officers
 have been reluctant to accept complaints from battered women.
 To deal with this problem, the Ministry of the Interior
 initiated a program in 1986 that created special sections
 within police departments to deal with violence against women,
 staffed by specially trained women.
 Gypsies are a minority group representing 3 percent of the
 Spanish population. Despite their constitutional rights, they
 suffer de facto discrimination in housing, schools, and jobs.
 Legal mechanisms exist by which they can seek redress, for
 example, from discrimination by an employer. As a practical
 matter, however, Gypsies do not normally seek such redress.
 The Government has stated its commitment to securing equal
 rights and treatment for Gypsies. A representative of the
 Gypsy community serves as special advisor to the Minister of
 Interior.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 All workers except those in the military services are entitled
 to form or join unions of their own choosing without previous
 authorization. The only requisites for forming a union are a
 group of more than two persons and registration with the
 Ministry of Labor and Social Security. There are no
 limitations on the right of association for workers in special
 economic zones. According to the European Commission, 11
 percent of the Spanish work force is unionized.
 Under the Constitution, trade unions are free to choose their
 own representatives, determine their own policies, represent
 their members, interests, and strike. They are not restricted
 or harassed by the Government. A strike is legal when it
 fulfills the requirement of 3 days' prior notice in the .
 private sector and 5 days in the public sector.. Illegal
 strikes are rare. Strikes affecting essential services must.
 respect legal minimum service requirements, which are
 negotiated between the Government and the unions.
 Spanish unions.'are free to form or join federations,
 confederations, and international bodies. Two major unions,
 the General Workers Union and the, Basque Solidarity Union
 (ELA/STV) are members of the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions and the European Trade Union Confederation.
 ELA/STV and the United Workers Union are also members of the
 World Confederation of Labor.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and bargain collectively was established
 by the Workers Statute of 1980. Trade union and collective
 bargaining rights were extended to all workers in the public
 sector, except the military services, in 1986. Public sector
 collective bargaining is restricted in those aspects that
 require approval of Parliament, i.e., salaries and employment
 levels. Collective bargaining is widespread in both the
 private and public sectors. Sixty percent of the working
 population is covered by private sector collective bargaining
 agreements, although only a minority are actually union
 members. Labor regulations in free trade zones and export
 processing zones are the same as in the rest of the country.
 There are no restrictions on the right to organize or on
 collective bargaining in such areas.
 The law prohibits discrimination by employers against union
 members and organizers. Discrimination cases have priority in
 the labor courts. No statistics are available on the number
 of antiunion.discrimination complaints. One practice which
 the unions consider discriminatory is the use by employers of
 temporary employment contracts. Around 26 percent of the work
 force is employed under this type of contract. The unions
 believe that employees engaging in union organizing under this
 type of contract are frequently not allowed to renew their
 contracts. This issue is the subject of a union complaint
 pending before the International Labor Organization.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is outlawed in Spain and is not
 practiced. Legislation is effectively enforced.
 
 
 1248
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The legal minimum age of employment as established by the
 Workers Statute is 16 years. The Ministry of Labor and Social
 Security is primarily responsible for enforcement. The
 minimum age is effectively enforced in major industries and in
 the service sector. It is more difficult to control on small
 farms and in family-owned businesses. Legislation prohibiting
 child labor is effectively enforced in the special economic
 zones. The Workers Statute also prohibits the employment of
 persons under 18 years of age at night, for overtime work, or
 in sectors considered hazardous by the Ministry of Labor and
 Social Security and the unions.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Workers in general have substantial, well-defined rights. A
 40-hour workweek is established by law. Spanish workers enjoy
 12 paid holidays a year and a month's paid vacation. All
 workers receive 12 monthly paychecks a year plus 2 bonus
 checks equivalent to an additional 2 months' salary. The
 legal minimum wage for workers over age 18 is 14 "monthly"
 paychecks amounting to $5,320 a year, which is sufficient for
 a worker's decent standard of living. Minimum wages for those
 aged 16 and 17 are less. The minimum wage rate is revised
 every year in accordance with the consumer price index.
 Government mechanisms exist for enforcing'working conditions
 and occupational health and safety conditions, but
 bureaucratic procedures- are cumbersome and inefficient.
