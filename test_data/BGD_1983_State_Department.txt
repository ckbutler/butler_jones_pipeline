 BANGLADESH
 
 Throughout 1983, Bangladesh continued to be governed by the
 Martial Law Administration, headed by Lieutenant General H. M.
 Ershad, which took power through a bloodless coup d'etat in
 March 1982. The military suspended the Constitution, dissolved
 the Parliament, and dismissed the popularly elected President,
 Abdus Sattar. Martial law regulations gave unchecked and
 unchallengeable powers to General Ershad as Chief Martial Law
 Administrator and to a three-level structure of martial law
 courts. The principal reasons given for the imposition of
 martial law included the need to eradicate corruption,
 reinvigorate the economy, and lay a stable foundation for a
 promised return to democratic institutions.
 The actions taken by the Martial Law Administration since its
 inception have generally been more restrained than its initial
 verbal assertion of unchecked powers would imply. A less
 authoritarian style of government, based in part on political
 negotiation, gradually superseded the more summary and rigorous
 features of martial law. As the military government became
 less preoccupied with eradicating corruption and more concerned
 with economic development, administrative decentralization and
 reform, and attracting civilian political support, public
 reference to the draconian martial law regulations virtually
 ended by the autumn of 1983. In November, however, martial law
 regulations were suddenly reimposed with renewed vigor as a
 result of political unrest, and the trend toward liberalization
 which had characterized most of 1983 suffered a setback.
 In 1983, the Government announced a series of elections
 designed to restore participatory politics gradually. It
 scheduled local, nonpartisan elections for December 1983
 through March 1984, a Presidential election for May 1984, and
 national parliamentary elections to be held on a party basis
 for November 1984. Having relaxed the ban on political
 activity in April 1983, the Martial Law Administration lifted
 the remaining restrictions in November but reimposed them
 following violent confrontations between political protestors
 and security forces. In December, General Ershad proclaimed
 himself President, a move which made him head of state in
 addition to head of government but which did not significantly
 increase his existing authority. The Martial Law
 Administration continues to assert, however, that elections
 will take place as previously announced.
 Local-level martial law courts continue to function, but
 formerly banned writs against the Government are in use again
 in the legal system. A somewhat reformed and substantially
 extended civilian court system, which continues to operate
 parallel to the martial law courts, has effectively resumed its
 full civil and criminal judicial responsibilities.
 With a per capita gross domestic product of only $120 and a
 peasant agricultural population of 95 million living in an area
 about the size of Wisconsin, Bangladesh is one of the poorest
 and most densely populated countries in the world. Devoted
 primarily to rice and jute culture, its deltaic land is fertile
 but vulnerable to flood and drought. Its population, the
 median age of which is only 16 years old, continues to grow at
 a rapid rate of 2.5 percent annually. Between one-third and
 one-half of its families are effectively landless, and 74
 percent of its inhabitants are illiterate. Deeply entrenched
 
 (1211)
 
 
 1212
 Muslim traditions, reinforced by illiteracy and the physical
 isolation of the villages, decree a pronounced subordination of
 women.
 Just after independence in 1972, and again between 1976 and
 1982, members of Bangladesh's elite endeavored to establish a
 democratic form of government by framing a constitution and
 experimenting with parliamentary and presidential systems.
 Nonetheless, the fact that Bangladesh has spent seven of its 12
 years since independence under martial law reflects the
 weakness of its political institutions, the staggering
 magnitude of its economic problems, and a belief among the
 military that it should share authority and responsibility for
 national affairs.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Killing for directly political motives is not common or routine
 in Bangladesh, although violence, including killing, between
 factions, gangs, and economic adversaries is sometimes given a
 political coloration. Several persons were killed during the
 confrontations between students, opposition political elements,
 and government security forces in February and November 1983.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no confirmed reports of disappearances resulting from
 official action. According to unconfirmed reports, however,
 approximately 60 tribal women from the Chittagong Hill Tracts
 have disappeared during army raids on their villages and may
 now be held in local garrisons.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or-Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 In 1983, there were private allegations of the use of torture
 by government security elements in Bangladesh. Police and
 soldiers do not appear well supervised when they handle
 prisoners. Threats of physical abuse and perhaps actual
 beating are occasionally employed to intimidate suspects
 detained in connection with such crimes as theft. Widespread
 or systematic torture is not, however, characteristic of
 Bangladesh, nor does the Government condone such practices.
 The press has reported sporadic police brutality, particularly
 in provincial areas, and there appears to have been substantial
 brutalization, believed to include beating and deprivation of
 food and water, of the approximately 1,500 students briefly
 detained after a confrontation with government forces in
 February. Political figures arrested at that time were
 interrogated while blindfolded. It is likely that up to 1,000
 people from various social groups--laborers, students,
 professionals, and politicians--were detained following the
 demonstrations and clashes in Dhaka and other cities in late
 November. The majority of those arrested were probably
 released quickly but approximately 25 political leaders
 remained in custody or under house arrest in December, and a
 somewhat larger number were likely evading arrest.
 
 
 1213
 According to one human rights activist, punishment of police
 and jail officials involved in mistreating a prisoner, takes
 place in case where a victim or his friends and family can
 attract publicity, but most mistreatment of obscure victims
 goes unpunished. According to the local press, in June four
 officers at a Dhaka police station were suspended after the
 death of a person in their custody. An inquiry committee was
 established to investigate the case; the result of the
 investigation is not known.
 Bangladesh's overcrowded jails reflect the extremely poor
 living conditions prevalent in that country. Prominent
 individuals who have been jailed say that, although
 uncomfortable, they were not mistreated. In at least the
 larger prisons, however, the conditions under which prominent
 persons and political prisoners (*class A' prisoners) are held
 are markedly better than those afforded ordinary criminals. On
 several occasions in 1983, inmates initiated hunger strikes to
 dramatize demands for better diets, better medical attention,
 and speedier trials. On at least two occasions, the Martial
 Law Administration responded with efforts to remedy
 conditions. In April 1983, it announced a commission to study
 penal reform with an eventual goal of improving facilities and
 evolving from a penal to a correctional system. Due primarily
 to resource constraints, prospects for rapid implementation of
 prison reforms are slight.
 Official punishment for offenses against martial law
 regulations range from fines to death, but no known executions
 have resulted from convictions under these regulations. In
 cases of corruption, sentences have included imprisonment up to
 14 years, fines, and confiscation of property. During 1983,
 however, a substantial number of prominent individuals
 convicted under martial law in 1982 were released, with illness
 being the most frequently cited reason. Six former ministers
 and 12 other major figures are now reportedly held in Dhaka's
 postgraduate hospital, and their terms may be shortened as
 well. Reliable figures are not available on how many lesser
 known individuals imprisoned with or without trial under
 martial law are still in custody. Observers estimate, however,
 that the number of persons in custody for offenses other than
 common-law ones may be in the low hundreds.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In 1983, the Government sought to notify families expeditiously
 of arrests and of detainees' whereabouts in corruption cases.
 Many of the approximately 1,500 students and politicians
 arrested following the student-government confrontations in
 February, were released within 10 days; virtually all were
 freed on or before March 25. In September, after demoting two
 influential members of the senior military leadership who were
 believed to oppose both civilianization of the regime and an
 investigation into the February student-government clashes, an
 inquiry commission headed by a Supreme Court judge was
 appointed to examine the Government's handling of the
 confrontation with the students. It is now taking testimony
 from experts and eyewitnesses. Following the episode of
 violent political unrest in November, the Government reported
 that it had detained or placed under house arrest 160 persons,
 including leaders of the major opposition political parties.
 At least 75 of these persons were released within two weeks.
 
 
 1214
 Martial law regulations authorize arrest for reasonable
 suspicion of having committed an offense and do not provide for
 habeas corpus. Offenses under these regulations include, among
 others, criticism of martial law, creation of panic, political
 activity, interference with the defense services, corruption,
 and smuggling. In practice, the Martial Law Administration has
 not fully exercised the broad authority it assumed. The
 suspended rights of habeas corpus and of bringing writs of any
 kind against the Government have, in practice, been largely
 reinstated in 1983.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Special Powers Act of 1974 remains in effect-and probably
 will continue to do so even after the end of martial law. The
 Act was reportedly invoked as the legal authority under which
 prominent political leaders were detained following the
 November disturbances. Under this law, persons may be detained
 without charge for 24 hours, held with the consent of a
 magistrate for 30 days, and held indefinitely with government
 approval.
 Several cases of people arrested on minor charges who have
 remained in jail without trial, forgotten for five to 10 years,
 have been brought to light by Bangladeshi human rights
 activists. In the past, over one-half of the prison population
 was reportedly undergoing or awaiting trial. Under new
 regulations which apply to civilian courts, if investigation
 has not been completed and charges have not been filed in an
 ordinary case within 90 days, the case must be dismissed and
 the prisoner freed. The regulations reflect an effort on the
 part of the Martial Law Administration to remedy one of the
 great abuses of the legal and penal system. To accomplish the
 goal of speedy justice, these changes also broaden the powers
 of the police and lower courts and limit appeal rights in minor
 cases. There have been no indications that these enlarged
 powers and more summary procedures have been misused by the
 police or lower magistrates.
 The Martial Law Administration has demonstrated a commitment to
 bring justice to 'the door steps of the public." Among the
 most significant steps in this program in 1983 was the
 dispersal of magistrate courts to the newly invigorated
 upazilla (subdistrict) level of government, an administrative
 unit of about 200,000 people. This follows last year's
 decentralization of the appellate judiciary, benches of which
 currently sit in six principal cities outside Dhaka.
 Decentralization of both criminal and civil judical functions
 has already reportedly resulted in a marked increase in the
 number of cases introduced to the docket. It is not clear that
 the backlog of cases will increase, however, since the new
 regulations emphasize expeditious processing.
 A three-level hierarchy of martial law courts continues to
 operate parallel to the civilian courts, but most civil and
 criminal cases are still heard by civilian courts in public
 trials in which the right to counsel is respected. A large
 backlog of perhaps 100,000 may still exist, but the courts
 appear to be functioning normally.
 
 
 1215
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Bangladesh authorities do not normally engage in arbitrary
 invasion of the home. For the civil court system, a judicial
 warrant is required before authorities enter a home, and courts
 require evidence of a reasonable basis of suspicion of
 involvement in a crime before issuing such a warrant. Martial
 law regulations provide for entry and search of the home under
 the same set of conditions but extend these powers to both
 military and police authorities.
 Wiretaps are not widely employed in Bangladesh, although they
 are probably used occasionally and selectively. Correspondence
 is not routinely monitored. The Bangladesh Government does
 maintain civilian and military intelligence services which
 concern themselves, in part, with domestic events but whose
 influence and capability are not pervasive.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech
 The Government owns and operates all radio and television
 facilities and owns and controls two of the four
 English-language dailies, two vernacular dailies, and two
 weeklies. Many privately owned Bengali-language periodicals
 circulate. Before martial law, many non-governmental
 newspapers were supported by political parties and reflected
 various political views. This practice continued under martial
 law, initially in a muted fashion, but then with increasing
 openness. The Bangladesh news media practice a certain degree
 of self-censorship by avoiding explicit criticism of the
 Government on topics perceived as particularly sensitive. The
 Government has in several instances detained and tried
 journalists for writing articles critical of martial law (an
 offense under martial law regulations), and some of these
 individuals are currently serving prison sentences.
 The Government exercises authority to ban foreign and domestic
 publications. The publication of five Bengali-language
 magazines was suspended in 1983. A daily newspaper, Dainik
 Desh, was closed on November 30 for publishing reports of
 politicians' remarks threatening the martial law authorities,
 but it was allowed to reopen in early December. Several books
 critical of Islam were also banned in the course of the year,
 and issues of foreign magazines have been banned or their
 circulation delayed in about a dozen cases.
 Although the February 1983 clashes between highly politicized
 student groups and government authorities resulted in the
 closure of universities for several months, and the November
 1983 confrontation between political parties and the Government
 led.to the indefinite closure of universities and colleges, the
 Martial Law Administration has promulgated no decrees which
 specifically reduce academic freedom. Academics and students
 are subject, however, to the same martial law restrictions as
 other citizens, and many university faculty members and
 students who oppose martial law have felt intimidated by this
 situation.
 
 
 1216
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The original martial law regulations prohibited any activity of
 a political party, any meeting of a political nature, and any
 gathering of over 100 people with the exception of cultural,
 literary, or religious events. The Government relaxed this ban
 in April 1983 by authorizing indoor political gatherings.
 Then, it tacitly and later officially lifted the remaining
 restrictions and allowed free political activity in preparation
 for the various local and national elections slated for late
 1983 through 1985. Between September and November, opposition
 political parties held meetings and rallies without incident
 and with police protection. The Government reimposed the ban
 on political activity, however, in late November as a result of
 violent political unrest.
 Given low wages and massive unemployment, labor unions in
 Bangladesh represent no more than three percent of the work
 force. These urban-based unions mainly serve as fronts for
 political parties and, thus, are subject to the same
 restraints. Labor unions have generally shown little effective
 activism on workers' issues. As a result of the Martial Law
 Administration's 1982 Industrial Relations Ordinance, which
 prohibited strikes, lockouts, and union meetings, labor union
 activity in 1983 has been nonconfrontational. The Ordinance
 provides for peaceful settlement of industrial disputes by
 negotiation, followed by binding arbitration, with referral of
 appeals to a labor court. Wage disputes are sometimes referred
 to wage boards.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 In predominantly Muslim Bangladesh, conversion from one
 religion to another is permitted, but proselytizing is not.
 Certain Islamic organizations have voiced concern over
 Christian missionary activities and the conversion of Muslims
 to Christianity. Present and preceding governments have all
 stated to Hindu, Buddhist, and Christian minorities, who
 combined constitute approximately 10 percent of the population,
 that national policy provides equality of treatment and freedom
 of worship for all groups. Although this policy is
 substantially respected, the numerical predominance of Muslims
 and South Asia's history of communal antagonism contribute to
 resentments. Members of minority religious groups are clearly
 disadvantaged in their access to government positions and
 political influence. Members of some minorities, principally
 Hindus, have lost or had serious difficulty retaining their
 properties as a result of prejudicial administration of
 Bangladesh's vested property laws. These laws provide that
 property belonging to persons who left Bangladesh between 1965
 and 1971 shall be managed by the Government. In October 1983,
 the Government announced the establishment of three religious
 welfare trusts to lend special support to Hindu, Buddhist, and
 Christian religious groups.
 An insurgent movement continued through most of 1983 among the
 approximately 500,000 tribal people who inhabit the Chittagong
 Hill Tracts, a geographically and socially atypical part of an
 otherwise generally homogeneous country. The predominantly
 Buddhist tribal population has been alienated by the
 Government's claim to land which the indigenous people regard
 as tribal property. Over the past decade, successive
 
 
 1217
 governments have settled close to 500,000 ethnic Bengalis in
 that territory.
 Clashes pitting police, army, and border patrol units against
 tribal insurgents continue. Although the number of deaths is
 believed to be low, reliable statistics are not available. In
 an attempt to end the insurgency, the Government announced in
 October 1983 an amnesty for all insurgents effective through
 February 1984. The Government says it will provide guerrillas
 who surrender with land, a year's income, food, education, and
 civil rights within Bangladesh. Simultaneously, the Government
 announced a special five-year intensified development plan for
 the Chittagong Hill Tracts which aims at integrating it
 econcmically and culturally into Bangladesh. Although the
 Government considers its new policy a generous one, the
 antigovernment tribal leadership continues to demand the
 preservation of the antonomous culture of the Chakmas and other
 tribes rather than integration into Bengali Muslim culture. In
 particular, insurgents continue to call for an end to Bengali
 settlement in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, a topic not mentioned
 in the Government's recent announcement of its new policy for
 that area.
 d.- Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Bangladesh citizens are free to move within the country, but
 there are designated 'protected areas" near the borders and
 certain other locations from which all nonresidents may be
 banned. Bangladeshis regarded as 'loyal' citizens, such as
 those against whom no criminal charges are pending, are
 generally free to visit or emigrate abroad, subject to foreign
 exchange controls. In some instances, persons deemed by the
 Government to be security risks have not been allowed to travel
 abroad at will. Ultimately, the martial law authorities
 determine who is a loyal citizen. Civil servants must obtain
 .no-objection certificates* from the ministry in which they are
 employed before traveling abroad, and citizens going overseas
 to work in the Middle East and elsewhere must register with the
 ministry responsible for manpower exports. The right of
 repatriation is observed in Bangladesh. Although the
 Government has no stated policy on refugee and asylum matters,
 it has in the past provided temporary asylum to sizable groups
 of Arakanese Muslim refugees from Burma.
 Approximately 250,000 non-Bengal Muslim Biharis remain in camps
 in Bangladesh, in principle pending resettlement in India or
 Pakistan. After independence in 1971, these Biharis opted for
 Pakistani citizenship. As neither Pakistan nor Bangladesh
 recognizes them as citizens, the issue remains unresolved, and
 the people are effectively stateless. Camp dwellers may seek
 employment and conduct other activities but face disadvantages
 as noncitizens. Some Biharis have lost property as a result of
 laws confiscating Pakistani holdings. On the other hand, those
 Biharis who chose to become Bangladeshi citizens in 1971 are
 entitled to full rights as such.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 The martial law declaration of March 25, 1982, suspended the
 Constitution and its electoral provisions, banned political
 
 
 1218
 activities (but not political parties), dissolved the Parliament,
 dismissed the elected President, and prohibited criticism of
 martial law or the spreading of 'prejudicial reports.' From the
 outset, however, the martial law authorities stated publicly
 their intention to return the country to representative
 government. During 1983, a timetable for local, Presidential,
 and parliamentary elections was announced. Despite an outbreak
 of political unrest late in the year, the Government continues to
 assert that it intends to meet this election timetable and to
 reinstate the Constitution in a largely unaltered form in 1984.
 As a key element of its overall reform efforts, the Martial Law
 Administration has announced and partially implemented plans to
 devolve power and responsibility to elected township and
 subdistrict councils, particularly in development matters.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Several international non-governmental human rights
 organizations, including Amnesty International, the International
 League for Human Rights, and the International Commission of
 Jurists are represented in Bangladesh. The Bangladesh Government
 has not obstructed independent outside investigations of alleged
 human rights violations, but no external missions have made
 inquiries in Bangladesh in 1983. In its 1983 report, Amnesty
 International expressed concern about the lack of procedural
 safeguards in the martial law courts, the trial of civilians in
 these courts, ill-treatment of political prisoners, the existence
 of the death penalty, and treatment of tribal groups in the
 Chittagong Bill Tracts. Freedom House rates Bangladesh 'partly
 free.* Several Bangladeshi organizations and individual lawyers
 are active in defending human rights issues through publicity
 designed to inform people of their rights, through the provision
 of legal aid to the poor, and through challenges in the courts.
 The majority of cases brought to and handled by these
 organizations involve the rights of pretrial prisoners and the
 treatment of women.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Present beliefs and underlying social barriers circumscribing the
 participation of women in activities beyond the home are strongly
 entrenched and show few signs of weakening. For the 90 percent
 of Bangladeshi women who live in rural areas, early marriage,
 high childbearing rates, and long hours of household labor leave
 little opportunity for nonfamily interests or outside
 employment. No culturally acceptable alternative to marriage
 exists for women, and childlessness is viewed as a personal
 catastrophe. Even in urban areas and among the affluent, the
 traditional social system simultaneously protects women and makes
 them economically dependent on their husbands or other male
 relatives.
 By custom and Muslim-influenced tradition, women occupy a
 subordinate, dependent place and receive unequal treatment before
 the law on a widespread and systematic basis. The ability of a
 family to seclude its women is a key symbol of middle or high
 social status. The daily press testifies to a pattern of
 domestic violence (murder, rape, torture), breach of matrimonial
 contract, denial of inheritance rights, and desertion, which
 victimizes women in Bangladesh and which is particularly acute
 
 
 1219
 among the poor. The rate of suicide among women is reported to
 be almost three times higher than among men. In an effort to
 recognize and remedy this situation, Dhaka's Voluntary Society
 for the Enforcement of Human Rights sponsored a well-attended and
 -publicized conference on *femicide" in February 1983. In
 October 1983, the Government promulgated a stringent Cruelty to
 Women Deterrent Punishment Ordinance. To check murder,
 kidnapping, abduction, and trafficking (including international
 trafficking) in women, the ordinance brings together the various
 statutes applicable to women and stiffens the penalties for
 abuse. It provides the death penalty for those directly
 responsible for a 'dowry killing' or for killing of a woman in
 the course of rape, although it does not address the abuse of a'
 woman stopping short of murder or rape or taking place within the
 family or home. "Dowry killings,* as reported in the press,
 usually share a common theme: the bride's family has not made
 full payment of a supposedly promised dowry, so the husband or
 his family attacks and often murders the bride.
 Since an estimated 60 percent of Bangladeshis subsist below an
 absolute poverty level, the Martial Law Administration's avowed
 priority is economic development. Its stated objective is to
 involve the entire population in economic advancement. Its key
 programs aim at increased agricultural yields, reduced population
 growth, administrative decentralization, and private sector
 development. The Martial Law Administration considers the
 eradication of corruption and inefficiency as necessary for the
 success of these efforts.
 In Bangladesh, efforts to induce economic growth confront serious
 obstacles. The 95 million people who live in 55,000 square miles
 have a population growth rate of 2.5 percent per year.
 Forty-five percent of the population is under 14 years of age.
 With the exception of natural gas and fertile alluvial soil, the
 country lacks natural resources. Annual per capita income
 amounts to only about $120 per year. Funds for investment, as
 well as the transportation and communications infrastructure, are
 limited. Literacy stands overall at approximately 25 percent,
 with a marked disparity between males and females and between
 urban and rural dwellers. Despite the Government's commitment to
 expand primary, secondary, and technical schooling, broad-based
 modern education is far from a reality. The technological level
 of capital and human assets is rudimentary, and the outward flow
 of educated and trained persons is substantial.
 Bangladesh's agricultural sector accounts for approximately 70
 percent of employment and 53 percent of gross domestic product.
 The economy is highly susceptible to fluctuations in the world
 market, commodity prices, and the vagaries of nature. The
 low-lying land and dependence on monsoon rains, combined with
 extremely simple farming methods, mean that a tropical storm or a
 few weeks variation in rainfall patterns can change subsistence
 into famine in a particular locality.
 The difficulties presented by the nature of the land and climate
 are compounded by social factors. One-half of the rural
 population is effectively landless. The average farm covers
 approximately two acres, but the several plots constituting a
 small holding may be widely separated from one another. Gains in
 food production have been offset in large part by population
 growth, and Bangladesh still experiences an annual food deficit.
 
 
 1220
 Bangladesh's industrial and service sectors are small, employing
 approximately 13 percent of the labor force and contributing only
 about nine percent to gross domestic product. While no accurate
 measurements of unemployment and underemployment exist, both are
 pervasive. Women are virtually absent from the cash work force.
 In addition to its large development program, which includes
 agricultural modernization, road building, and rural
 electrification, the Martial Law Administration has instituted
 industrial and tax policies to strengthen the private sector in
 an effort to encourage growth of productive industry. Despite
 government inducements, relatively few industries have located in
 rural areas, and it is unlikely that many will do so in the near
 future.
 The poverty of Bangladesh is evident in the poor health and
 nutritional standards of the country. Life expectancy at birth
 is 46 years. The infant mortality rate averages 143 deaths per
 1,000 live births. Only 53 percent of the population has access
 to safe water. Health and nutritional programs represent about
 3.7 percent of the government budget. On a per capita basis,
 nutritional intake currently amounts to 1,870 calories per day,
 indicating a downward trend over the last 15 years.
