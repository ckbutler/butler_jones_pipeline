 UZBEKISTAN
 With the breakup of the Soviet Union, the Republic of Uzbekistan declared its
 independence in August 1991. The most populous of the Central Asian states with
 about 21 million people, Uzbekistan is engaged in what has proven to be a difficult
 transition from a  uthoritarian legacy to a pluralistic democracy.
 The National Democratic Party of Uzbekistan (NDPU), in many respects the suc-
 cessar organization to the Communist Party, controls the political system  Islam
 Karimov the First Secretary of the Communist Party during Soviet rule, won elec-
 tion in december 1991 as the country's first President. Along with the NDPU, he
 continues to dominate the political life of the country. Despite the Government's offi-
 cially stated goal of a multiparty democracy, it has been slowto put democratic re-
 forms into practice.
 The Committee for State Security (KGB), renamed the National Security Service,
 and the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) retained their traditional roles as impor-
 tant instruments for maintaining the Government's control over society, especially
 the political opposition. In that role, they were responsible for significant human
 rights abuses. Uzbekistan began establishing its own armed forces in 1992, using
 staff and equipment remaining from the still sizable Soviet military forces in the
 country. The Government also began to establish an armed border service.
 Uzbekistan is the world's fourth largest producer of cotton, and its industry is
 geared to support cotton harvesting and processing. It is also a major producer of
 minerals, such as gold and uranium, as well as natural gas. The Government took
 some steps in 1992 towards introducing a free market economy, mainly through leg-
 islative changes, but the vast majority of enterprises remained in state hands. Gov-
 ernment efforts to attract foreign investment were handicapped by the cautious jpri-
 v   tation policy and a sometimes unpredictable business climate. While the Gov-
 ernment continued to subsidize energy products and basic consumer goods such as
 bread, it freed other prices, and inflation increased.
 Relative to the Soviet era, Uzbekistan made some progress in human rights in
 1992. The Parliament adopted a relatively pregressive Constitution on December 8
 which estabishes a number of important rights for individuals and groups, although
 in most cases implementing legislation will also be required. A number of new laws
 were passed, such as those defining citizenship and minority ri hts and protecting
 religious freedom. The regime's heavy-handed control of the political process, how-
 ever, was a major impediment to further progress and ft in doubt its commitment
 to democratization.
 In several cases, unknown persons assaulted opposition activists, sometimes se-
 verly, and a promised governmental investigation of one serious case did not iden-
 tifr the perpetrators. Despite government denials, the frequency of assaults on oppo-
 sition political figures, wlth the assailants never being apprehended, suggested gov-
 
 
 ernment involvement. Security forces frequently detained or arrested opposition ac-
 tivists arbitrarily for their political activity.
 The Government refused to register a number of political groups and parties and
 harassed some of those it did register. The ban on outdoor public meetings was en.
 forced by the security services, which broke up some unauthorized meetings and
 prevented others. Government censorship of the media prevented effective criticism
 of government policies and activities. The security services continued to interfere
 with the privacy of persons through surveillance and telephone tapping. Someoppo.
 sition activists were dismissed from places of employment due to their political be.
 liefs.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Extrajudicial Kiling.-There were no reported incidents of politi-
 cally motivated killings in 1992. During the January 16-17 student demonstrations
 over bread price rises, security forces opened fire on an unarmed crowd and killed
 theeparticipants
 bt  Disapperanc.-There were no reported cases of abductions by official forces
 or politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no reports of torture in 1992. There were credible reports that police
 occasionally beat detainees while they were taking them into custody or in the pe-
 riod between arrest and trial.
 The number of opposition figures beaten on the streets in 1992 by persons who
 were never caught indicated a calculated government effort to intimidate the opposi-
 tion. The most serious incident was the beating of Chairman Abdurahim Pulatov
 of the Birlik (Unity) movement on June 29 in Tashkent. After emerging from the
 local Ministry of the Interior headquarters where he had been called for question-
 ing, Pulatov was severely beaten with metal clubs by a group of young persons who
 fractured his skull. The Government denied responsibility and promised an inves-
 tigation; by year's end, however, they had not produced a report. In separate beating
 incidents other victims from the opposition included the Khorezm Regional Chair-
 man of Airlik, Abdulla Yusupov, Birlik Presidium member Miralym Adylov, who
 was attacked three times this year, the leader of Birlik's youth movement Ravhan
 Dzuraev the journalist Abdurashid Sharipov, and the leader of the People's Move-
 ment of Turkestan, Bahram Gaib.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-According to law, a person suspected of
 committing a crime may be held by the police for questioning for up to 3 days. At
 the end or this period, the suspect must be either officially charged or released. A
 court case must be scheduled within 15 days of arrest and begin by the 22nd day.
 These deadlines have sometimes been overltked in cases with political overtones.
 A number of opposition figures complained of legal irregularities in the handling of
 their cases, including arrest without proper prosecutorial warrants and detention
 beyond the legally sanctioned 15-day period. These complaints appear to be borne
 out by the facts. Prosecutorial orders are required for arrests, but such orders or
 warrants are not required for detentions. In the absence of bail, detainees who are
 deemed not to be violent may be released on their own recognizance pending trial.
 The legal provision permitting detention for 3 days without charges led to dozens
 of instances in which opposition figures were detained arbitrarily for questioning
 and then released witheut being charged. In most cases, opposition figures were ar-
 rested on nonpolitical charges such as drunkenness or disorderliness rather than for
 criticizing government policy. For example, Birlik activist Pulat Akhunov was
 charged with hooliganism, and the leader of the People's Movement of Turkestan,
 Bahram Gaib, was charged with drunkenness. These charges appear to have been
 fabricated as part of a systematic effort to silence the opposition. Defendants may
 not have access to defense counsel during detention. Only after they are formally
 arrested may they have such access.
 Three human rights activists were' seized from a conference in Bishkek
 Kyrguzstan, by the National Security Service. Two of the three have been released
 (see Section 3).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-Uzbekistan inherited the Soviet judicial system
 which features trial by a panel of three judges: one professional judge and two "peo-
 pie's assessors" who are chosen by workers collectives for a period of 2V years.
 Judges may be removed for crimes or for failure to fulfill their obligations, but the
 procedure or dismissing judges is complicated. No evidence has appeared that any
 judges have been removed for political reasons. The new Constitution provides for
 appointment of all judges for 10-year terms by the President but, according to inter-
 
 
 972
 
 national legal experts, does not seem to provide mechanisms to ensure the judges'
 independence once they are appointed.
 There is a three-tiered court system: the People's Court on the district level, the
 Regional Courts, and the Supreme Court. District court decisions may be appealed
 to the next higher level within 10 days of the ruling. The Constitution forbids the
 establishment of alternative courts. The Islamic fundamentalist group Adolat (Jus-
 tie) attempted to set up alternative Islamic courts in the city of amangan to insti-
 tute a system of Islamic justice. After incidents allegedly perpetrated by individuals
 intent on enforcing Islamic justice and standards of dress, the Government cracked
 down on Adolat members, arresting 10 of them on March 17. Those arrested in
 March were taken to Tashkent where they were still being held in December pend-
 ingcompletion of criminal investigations.
 Most court cases are open to the public, but the courtroom may be closed in some
 exceptional cases, such as those involving rape or murder. Defendants have the
 right to attend the proceedings, confront witnesses, and present evidence. The ac-
 cused has access to the lawyer of his choice. The State will provide a lawyer without
 charge; if the accused chooses his own, he must make his own financial arrange-
 ments.
 The legal system is undergoing a process of reform as Soviet-era crimes such as
 speculation and parasitism are removed from the legal code.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.--Search
 warrants are required from a prosecutor. Security agencies have the technical abil-
 ity to monitor telephone calls, and there is evidence that they employ surveillance
 and wiretap telephones in the cases of persons involved in opposition political activi-
 ties.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech is severely limited. It is an
 offense, for example, to "offend the honor and dignity of the President." Moreover,
 although the newly adopted Constitution prohibits censorship, it is widely practiced.
 The central Government tolerates little, if any, criticism of its actions. Since state
 enterprises control the printing presses, newspapers cannot be printed without the
 censor's approval. Journalists and writers who want to ensure that their work is
 published practice self-censorship.
 The majority of Uzbekistan's newspapers are government controlled. Independent
 newspapers may be established but must be registered .ith the Government in
 order to be legally published. The Government refused to register the onposition or-
 ganization Birlik s newspaper, allegedly because it received fnaiiinF rom outside
 the country. Birlik activists went on a hunger strike in February, unsuccessfully de-
 manding registration of their newspaper. Birlik published several editions of its
 paper in Russia and smuggled them back to Uzbekistan for distribution. Three secu-
 rity force raids on offices and homes of activists resulted in the confiscation of ap-
 proximately 8,000 copies of the paper. Several members were questioned on charges
 of p ossessing an illegal newspaper, but no arrests resulted from  any of these
 confiscations.
 Editors of the newspaper published by the legally registered Erk (Freedom) politi-
 cal party complained that censors deleted a significant portion of their material in
 each issue. In one instance, censors eliminated the party's economic program and
 its statement on the draft constitution. Although the newspaper was permitted to
 publish, the denial of access to newsprint often limited its circulation. Later in 1992,
 another government injunction removed the paper from the newsstands, limiting its
 circulation to registered subscribers. A government crackdown on the Erk party
 headquarters and newspaper printing ofices in early December implied that the
 Government intended to close down the newspaper and possibly even the party.
 The Government also censored material in locally printed editions of newspapers
 originating in the Russian Federation. To signal its displeasure with articles critical
 of Uzbekistan that appeared in the Moscow edition of the Russian newspaper,
 Izvestia, the Government twice suspended local printing of the Central Asian edi-
 tion of Izvestia during the summer. Finally, in November, following publication of
 an appeal from the editors to President Karimov to end censorship, the Government
 fully suspended local operations of the newspaper and refused to allow subscriptions
 to be accepted for 1993. It also temporarily prevented distribution of the Russian
 newspaper, Komsomolskaya Pravda. While the latter has reappeared on the news-
 stands, Izvestia is no longer available in Uzbekistan.
 A new commercial newspaper Businessman, was officially registered in April but
 shut down in August, reportedly after it published several articles critical of the
 Government's economic policies.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of assembly is not
 guaranteed in Uzbekistan. Demonstrations must be government sanctioned, and the
 Government does not routinely grant this permission. The Supreme Soviet adopted
 the regulation against holding unsanctioned meetings outdoors after ethnic violence
 in Fergana valley in 1989 to maintain public order and stability. Opposition re-
 quests for permission to hold outdoor meetings were in most cases denied. A cordon
 of militia prevented several attempts by groups such as Birlik to hold unsanctioned
 demonstrations. On July 2, opposition meetings were planned to coincide with the
 opening session of the Supreme Soviet in Tashkent but police blocked the main
 square, and in some cities such as Samarkand and Namangan they arrested many
 opposition members.
 The Government limited the exercise of freedom of association in Uzbekistan on
 1992, particularly with respect to political parties (see Section 3). The Government
 blocked an attempt by the political opposition in the spring of 1992 to set up an
 alternative 'parliament" the Majlis Melli, was dealt a decisive blow by the Govern-
 ment. Although the Msjiis Mell met only once and no final documents were signed,
 most participants were called in for questioning. Three of the meeting's organizers
 Babur Shakirov, Hazratkul Khodaberdiev, and Atanzar Aripov, were arrested and
 are under investigation for attempting to overthrow the Government. At year's end,
 the case had not come to trial. Shakirov, however, remains in detention months be-
 yond the legal detention period (see Section 1.d.).
 c. Freedom of Rel*ion.Freedom of religion is guaranteed in the new Constitu-
 tion as is the principle of separation of church and state. After the enforced atheism
 of t1e Soviet years, religious communities are experiencing a significant revival.
 Mosques are reopeninand new ones are being built. Religious education is becom-
 ing more widespread. While Islam is the religion of the majority, ethnic minorities
 also may practice their religion in relative freedom. Synagogues for the Jewish com-
 munity are openly functioning, Hebrew education, long banned under the Soviets,
 Jewish cultural events, and the publication of a community newspaper take place
 undisturbed.
 Christian Pentacostals, a small group of some 70 members, complained that the
 Government refused to register their church. The German Lutheran Community in
 Tashkent has complained that, despite repeated requests, its church, built in 1899
 and closed by Stalin in 1937, has not been returned to the community as their prop-
 erty. However, other Christian groups are functioning without problems.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigratin, and Re-
 patriation.-he new Constitution guarantees free movement within the country
 and across its borders. Travel within Uzbekistan is not controlled; however, chang-
 ing residences to another city requires a new residence permit, which may be dif-
 ficult to obtain. In 1992 the Government paid less attention to enforcing the permit
 system than the Soviets had formerly done. As the availability of private housing
 increased, permits were not as necessary for securing new housing.
 Travel by foreigners including journalists, within Uzbekistan is still controlled.
 Visitors must have each city they wish to visit noted in their passports.
 Most barriers to emigration were lifed before the Soviet breakup. Although in
 some instances emigrants are delayed by long waits for passports and exit visas, po-
 tential emigrants who can find a host country wlingto accept them are able to
 leave the country.
 Although the Constitution guarantees free movement across Uzbekistan's borders
 the right of citizens to leave freely for nonimmigrant travel is at times infringed
 upon by government withholding of exit visas or passports, sometimes for political
 reasons. A new law -in defense of constitutional organs of power" specifies a punish-
 ment of 1 to 3 years for the first offense of exiting the country "in violation of the
 established order" and 2 to 5 years for a repeat offender. See Section 4 for details
 of the Bishkek Human Rights Conference.
 The law on citizenship adopted in 1992 stipulates that citizens do not lose their
 citizenship if they reside overseas. If they return to Uzbekistan as foreign citizens,
 however, they are subject toforeign visa regulations. There is no evidence that any-
 one, including emigrants to Israel, was denied permission to return.
 Many thousands of refugees entered Uzbekistan in 1992 fleeing violence in neigh-
 boring Ti&kistan. The Government did not want to host a massive refugee influx,
 and in Juy and August it returned an estimated 30,000 persons to Tajikistan. The
 official policy is not to give residence permits to such refugees. As fighting in
 Tajikistan increased, more refugees crossed into Uzbekistan during October, some
 of them staying with relatives in Uzbekistan. While not encouraging them to stay,
 the Government took a more tolerant attitude toward their presence than was the
 case during the summer. However, as of late December, it appears that the border
 is effectively sealed.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The right of citizens to change their government through peaceful and democratic
 means is open to considerable doubt, despite the multicandidate presidential elec-
 tions held in December 1991. Islam Karimov, then First Secretary of the
 Uzbekistan's Communist Party and the country's effective leader, ran in a two-man
 race against Erk Party leader Mohamed Solikh. Karimov won with 86 percent of
 the vote to Solikh's 12 percent. However, Solikh complained that he did not have
 the access to the media enjoyed by the incumbent and that there were voting irreg-
 ularities. Credible sources indicate that Karimov not only had at his disposal the
 Republic's state aparatus but also controlled the media, which he exploited. In ad-
 dition, the elections validity was called into 9luestion by the careful exclusion of
 Birlik leader Abdurahim Pulatov, whose potential candidacy was derailed by a com-
 plex series of hurdles stemming from the fact that the movement had not been reg-
 istered as a party.
 The Government's professed desire to create a multiparty democracy is belied by
 its actions since independence. The Government has sought to control the opposition
 is through the legal requirement that all political parties register. By law, organiza-
 tions and movements must be registered with the Government. To register, a politi-
 cal party must submit a list of at least 3,000 members.
 There are currently three legally, registered parties. The leaders of Uzbekistan's
 Communist Party, including President Karimov, created the National Democratic
 Party of Uzbekistan (NDPU) after the failed August 1991 coup in Moscow. It domi-
 nates the political scene. In addition to Karimov, its members include the majority
 of the Supreme Soviet, elected in February 1990 for 5-year terms under conditions
 of Communist Party dominance. Usman Azimov, an adviser to President Karimov,
 formed the Fatherland Development Party during the summer and was able to reg-
 ister it quickly.
 The only opposition party to register successfully so far is Erk (Freedom), which
 was registered in 1991. Er was a faction that broke away from Birlik (Unity) in
 1990. Both groups, however, claim to share similar goals, including the development
 of a pluralistic and secular democratic system and a mixed economy. The Govern-
 ment and some foreign observers question the sincerity of the secular goals and be-
 lieve that at least Birlik now has a more fundamentalist agend. Erk leaders claim
 that the Government has not allowed it to operate freely. In July the Supreme So-
 viet amended the law on parties and added a clause that allows the legal registra-
 tion of a party to be stripped for holding demonstrations against the Government.
 On December 3, the Government presented Erk officials with a 3-day ultimatum
 to vacate their headquarters and newspaper offices in downtown Tashkent. Authori-
 ties impounded the party's four cars and sealed some of their offices, purportedly
 for nonpayment of expenses. This serious increase in government pressure left in
 doubt whether the Government will permit the Erk Party to continue to function.
 Despite this ultimatum, Erk members continued to operate out of their head-
 quarters through at least the end of December.
 The Government permitted Birlik to register as a movement but has consistently
 denied it permission to register as a party, citing irregularities on the membership
 list, a legal requirement that prohibits a movement and a party from having the
 same name, and the failure of Birlik to present proper documentation. Government
 officials claim that Birlik is not really interested in registering but rather in using
 the issue to embarrass the Government. Birlik, which claims to have 500,000 adher-
 ents, has contended that its failure to secure registration is evidence of the Govern-
 ment's undemocratic nature. It appears that the Government's consideration of
 Birlik's registration application has been significantly more intensive and critical
 than its review of other applications. A December parliamentary session raised the
 question of Birlik's legality and referred this case to the Supreme Court. If the
 Court determines the group guilty, Parliament may then seek to ban the movement
 altogether.
 A government crackdown on opposition activists in earl y December, before a
 human rights conference in Bishkek and the Supreme Soviets session of December
 8, further increased the pressure on the opposition. On December 3, the authorities
 detained leaders of Birlik, Erk, the Human Rights Society, and the Free Peasants'
 Party who had planned to attend the Bishkek Conference. The MVD issued formal
 warnings that if the activists went to Bishkek, they would be charged with attend-
 ing an unsanctioned meeting and could be imprisoned for up to 3 years under the
 current Criminal Code. MVD agents subsequently abducted three of those activists
 in Bishkek while they were in attendance at the Conference and returned them to
 Tashkent. The authorities arrested one of the three, Abdumanov Pulatov but
 charged him for an earlier incident of "insulting the honor of the President," not for
 
 
 975
 attending the conference. Most of the other Uzbekistani participants in the Bishkek
 Conference were called in for questioning upon their return to Uzbekistan but were
 not arrested.
 An amendment to the law on public organizations prohibits any political party
 based on religion or ethnicity. The Government has used this law to deny registra-
 tion to other political parties, including the Islamic Renaissance Party, which ap-
 pears to have a measure of popular support, and the People's Movement of
 Turkestan, which advocates unification of the Muslim Central Asian republics.
 In addition to the laws on registration, the Government has also sought to control
 the opposition through harassment and intimidation. Political opponents have been
 arrested, dismissed from their jobs, beaten, and threatened in a systematic manner
 under circumstances which suggest the involvement of government agencies. The
 Government froze the bank accounts of both Erk and Birlik and seized the assets
 of the former. Active members of both Erk and Birlik were fired from their jobs
 while other members were threatened with loss of employment if they continued
 their association with these organizations. Birlik cochairman Shukrat lsmatullaev
 was dismissed from his job as a professor at Tashkent State University.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government disapproves of independent nongovernmental local human rights
 organizations and has restricted their operation. The Uzbekistan Human Rights So-
 ciety, a local group organized in 1992, was denied permission to register. Subse-
 quently, its deputy charman, Mikhail Ardzinov, was arrested on June 30 and held
 or 10 days without charges being filed. After his release, a suspicious explosion
 burned down his house.
 The Government typically regards international criticism as interference in its in-
 ternal affairs. It is particularly sensitive about the involvement of foreign govern-
 ment and nongovernmental organizations (NGO) in the investigation of human
 rights issues even though it has pledged to observe the human rights obligations
 in CSCE. While the Government did meet with NGO representatives in 1992, it
 amended the law on public organizations in July to require international public or-
 ganizations to register, thus providing itself the legal basis to oust any foreign orga-
 nization that displeases it by talking with the political opposition. The Government
 interfered with attendance by opposition figures from Uzbekistan at the Bishkek
 Conference in December 1992, both before and after the event (see Section 3).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 There is no officially sanctioned discrimination on the basis of sex, religion Ian-
 u age, or social status. The 1992 law on citizenship and the Constitution both en-
 shrine this principle. In a population of about 21 million, 71 percent are Uzbeks,
 8 percent Russians, 5 percent Tajik, 4 percent Tatar, and 3 percent Kazakh.
 Uzbekistan's citizenship law passed in July 1992 does not institute language re-
 quirements for citizenship. Nonetheless, the language issue remains very sensitive.
 Uzbek has been declared the state language, and non-Uzbek speakers increasingly
 feel themselves threatened. Many report unpleasant experiences with their neigh-
 bors or in stores. When government organizations and academic institutions have
 been compelled to reduce their work force, it is frequently the Russian speakers who
 have lost their jobs.
 There is no legal discrimination against women. However women are severely
 underrepresentel in high-level positions throughout society. They are not formally
 impededfrom seeking employment, but due to traditional family roles they usually
 marry young and bear many children. In rural areas, women often find themselves
 confined to backbreaking labor in the cotton fields.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Assoeiation.-Uzbekistan's new law on unions, adopted on June
 2, 1992, represents a significant shift toward legal recognition of worker rights in
 some respects. In sharp contrast with the Labor Code of 1988, the new law specifi-
 cally proclaims that all workers have the right voluntarily to create and join unions
 of their choice. In addition, trade unions themselves may voluntarily associate terri-
 torially or sectorally and may choose their own international affiliations. The law
 also declares all unions independent of the State's administrative and economic bod-
 ies (except where provided by law) and provides that trade unions develop their own
 charters, structure, and executive bodies and organize their own work.
 So far, however, the overall structure of trade unions has not really changed, nor
 have the unions exhibited much autonomy. Most of the same people remain in place
 in leadership roles. Independence eliminated subordination to Moscow but did not
 alter the centralized trade union hierarchy within Uzbekistan. There are a few new
 
 
 976
 
 unions; for example, a union of entrepreneurs and one of renters. These appear to
 replicate the structure of existing trade unions in almost every detail. No "alter-
 native" central union structures exist.
 The union pyramid is now capped by a Soviet of the Federation of Trade Unions.
 The new trade union law spec ically names this group as having a consultative
 voice in preparing legislation affecting workers and in drafting laws on labor and
 social issues.
 Trade union representatives in Uzbekistan are quick to explain that their func-
 tions have changed considerably since the breakup of the Soviet Union. In the new
 union law, trade unions are described as organizations that defend the right to work
 and protect jobs. The law eliminates the once carefully defined trade union role in
 state planning and in the management of enterprises. The emphasis now is on the
 unions' responsibility for "social protection," especially for unemployment compensa-
 tion, pensions, and worker retraining in view of the country's difficult economic cir-
 cumstances.
 The trade union law does not mention strikes or cite a right to strike. However,
 the law does give the unions oversight over both individual and collective labor dis-
 putes. Labor disputes are defined in the law as those involving alleged violations
 of labor laws, worker rights, or collective agreements. This extends union power
 compared to the old law, under which local unions shared limited rights to review
 such disputes with local courts and special commissions within factories or enter-
 prises. Except for a hunger strike by journalists (see Section 2.a.), no strikes were
 known to have occurred.                                     -i
 Uzbekistan became a member of the International Labor Organization on July 13,
 1992.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The new Trade Union law
 empowers trade unions to conclude agreements with enterprises. However, since pri.
 vatization has just begun, there is no experience yet with negotiations between
 unions and private employers. With very few exceptions, the State is still the major
 employer, and the unions do not appear to presume conflicts of interest with the
 State. The minimum wage and wages for government employees are set by the Min-
 istry of Finance. Enterprises operating on a self-financing basis set their own wage
 rates.
 Discrimination against union members and their officers is forbidden by law. No
 complaints have been reported, which is not surprising in view of the trade unions'
 very close association with the Government, and therefore with the major employer.
 There are no expert processing zones in Uzbekistan.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Copulsory Labor.-Forced labor is not known to be
 practiced and is specifically prohibited by the Constitution except as a court-imposed
 punishment, or "in other cases as prescribed by law."
 d. Minimum Age for Employrment of Children.-The minimum working age is 16.
 Those aged 15 may work with permission but have a shorter workday. In rural
 areas, 14-year-olds turn out to help with the cotton harvest.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage is set by the Ministry of
 Finance in consultation with the Federation of Trade Unions. It was raised several
 times in 1992 but is still not sufficient to provide food for the average family. The
 standard workweek is set at 41 hours. Some factories have apparently reduced work
 hours in order to avoid layoffs. Some workers are entitled to overtime pay, but it
 is rarely paid. Occupational health and safety standards are established by the
 Labor Ministry in consultation with the unions and implemented by the Health and
 Safety Inspectorate within the Labor Ministry.
