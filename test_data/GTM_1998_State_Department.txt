 GUATEMALA
 Guatemala is a democratic republic with separation of powers and a centralized
 national administration. The 1985 Constitution provides for election by universal
 suffrage of a one-term president and a unicameral congress. In the November 1995
 elections, the National Advancement Party (PAN) won 42 of the 80 congressional
 seats; however, no presidential candidate received an absolute majority of the votes.
 Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen of the PAN won the runoff presidential election and took office
 in January 1996. Reflecting a greater opeg for political activity, 24 parties, in-
 cluding a broad front coalition composed of civic, human rights, and labor leaders,
 campaigned in the free and fair elections. The judiciary is independent, but suffers
 from inefficiency and corruption.
 The Arzu administration continued implementation of the Peace Accords that it
 signed with the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) guerrillas in
 1996. In October the Congressapproved a number of key constitutional reforms en-
 
 
 633
 
 visioned by the Peace Accords. These reforms recognize the multiethnic,
 pluricultural, and multilingual nature of the country, permit a civilian Minister of
 Defense, and redefine the role of the military. The reforms will not go into effect
 until approved by a citizens' referendum planned for 1999. The United Nations
 Human Rights Verification Mission (MINUGUA), established in November 1994 to
 monitor compliance with the Government-URNG human rights accord, continued
 monitoring peace implementation issues.
 The Minister of Government oversees the National Civilian Police (PNC), created
 in January 1997 under the terms of the Peace Accords. The PNC has sole respon-
 sibility for internal security; however, during the year members of the National Po-
 lice (PN) remained on duty. There are no active members of the military in the po-
 lice command structure, but President Arzu ordered the army to support the police
 temporarily in response to a nationwide wave of violent crime. Military forces are
 nominally subordinated to civilian police in joint operations. Some members of the
 police and security forces committed human rights abuses.
 The agricultural-based, private sector-oriented economy grew by approximately 4
 percent in real terms in 1997. Coffee, sugar, and bananas are the leading exports,
 and more than half the work force is engaged in some form of agriculture, although
 the products of "maquila" or assembly operations are gaining in importance. Infla-
 tion was about 8 percent in 1998. In October Hurricane Mitch caused approximately
 250 deaths and infrastructure, crop, and other losses totaling an estimated $550
 million. There is a marked disparity in income distribution, and poverty is perva-
 sive, particularly in the large indigenous community. According to United Nations
 (U.N.) statistics, approximately 80 percent of citizens live in poverty; this figure
 rises to 90 percent among the indigenous population. Per capita gross national prod-
 uct was approximately $1,650 in 1997.
 The overall human rights situation continued to improve measurably. New cases
 of human rights abuses continued'to decline, but problems remain in some areas.
 Some police officers were accused of extrajudicial killings and mistreated suspects
 and detainees. Prison conditions remain harsh. Arbitrary arrest and detention and
 lengthy pretrial detention remain problems. The PNC was deployed and preliminary
 reports of its actions showed improvement compared with the PN's record. With
 judges and other law enforcement officials subject to intimidation and corruption,
 the inefficient judicial system is often unable to ensure fair trials and due process.
 Efforts to reform the judiciary continued in an attempt to eliminate the climate of
 impunity. The Government achieved convictions in several important cases involv-
 ing past human rights violations, including its first conviction of participants in con-
 fiict-era  massacres, although  other cases remain   unresolved. There were
 unconfirmed reports that elements of the police and military infringed on citizens'
 privacy rights. In the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch, President Arzu temporarily
 suspended certain civil liberties as an emergency measure. Discrimination and vio-
 lence against women persisted, as did societal abuse of children and discrimination
 against the disabled and indigenous people. On April 26, an internationally re-
 nowned Catholic bishop and human rights activist was murdered under suspicious
 circumstances. Lynchings, mob attacks, and unsolved killings continued, and the
 Government frequently was unable to prosecute the perpetrators.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no allegations of politi-
 cally motivated killings by government agents; however, members of the police were
 accused of some extrajudicial killings. The Government demonstrated a willingness
 to arrest and prosecute those responsible. However, the scarcity of law enforcement
 resources and a weak prosecutorial and judicial system prevented the Government
 from adequately investigating many killings or other crimes or arresting and suc-
 cessfully prosecuting perpetrators.
 The number of extrajudicial killings continued to decline and the nature of viola-
 tions changed. The office of the Human Rights Ombudsman (PDH), which generally
 compiles data based on personal interviews with victims and their families, reported
 32 complaints of extrajudicial killings during the year, compared with 134 in all of
 1997, 173 in 1996, and 216 in 1995. MINUGUA investigated 35 complaints of
 extrajudicial killings during the year and had confirmed 13 by year's end. It re-
 ported 40 such complaints in 1997. Primarily using media reports, the Archbishop's
 Human Rights Office (ODHAG) compiled 61 unconfirmed reports of extrajudicial
 killings during the year, compared with 118 in all of 1997. In classifying murders
 as extrajudicial killings, the ODHAG applies a broader definition than the PDH or
 MINUGUA, including many cases in which state agents were not suspected.
 
 
 Although a number of cases from past years remained unresolved, there were sev-
 eral convictions during the year for past extrajudicial killings by members of the se-
 curity forces.
 In January a court sentenced each of 11 former members of a civil defense patrol
 (PAC) to 10 years' imprisonment for their roles in the 1993 killing of Juan Pablo
 Chanay during a demonstration; in July the court lengthened these sentences to 25
 years. Several former PAC members involved in the incident remained at large. The
 investigation of retired Brigadier General Luis Felipe Miranda Trejo, the alleged in-
 tellectual author of the killing, remained open. In February 1997, the Government
 reached a settlement with the plaintiffs in the case before the Inter-American Com-
 mission on Human Rights (IACHR). This settlement provided for an indemnity to
 Chanay's family, which the Government paid, and an indemnity to the community
 in the form of a series of public works projects. The Government has nearly com-
 pleted the construction of these public works projects.
 In February a civilian court convicted Obdulio Villanueva Arevalo, a member of
 the Presidential Military Staff, of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced him to 5
 years' imprisonment and a fine for the 1996 death of Pedro Sas Rompich. The day
 of Sas Rompich's death, Villanueva was on duty as a presidential bodyguard while
 President Arzu and his wife were horseback riding. Villanueva shot and killed Sas
 Rompich when the latter drove his truck towards the President, reportedly in a
 threatening manner. Villanueva's prison term was commuted in April, subject to his
 payment of a fine. During Villanueva's trial, EMP members reportedly attempted
 to intimidate those in attendance. In addition, the court called for an investigation
 into the fact that the EMP had intercepted and opened an envelope containing lab-
 oratory test results relating to the victim's body.
 In March the Inter-American Court of Human Rights found the Government lia-
 ble in the "white van" case for the murder of 5 persons, the torture of 7 persons,
 and for violating the right to liberty of 8 persons. Members of the now-disbanded
 Treasury Police kidnaped and then either released or killed 11 persons between
 1987 and 1988. Proceedings to set the amount of compensation due are pending.
 In May a court convicted Marlon Salazar and Roberto Antonio Trabanino of the
 April 1994 murder of Constitutional Court President Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon
 and sentenced each of them to 27 years' imprisonment. A third suspect, Mario Rene
 Salazar, remained at large.
 In July the Constitutional Court denied an appeal of the death sentence imposed
 against three former police officers for a 1995 murder (and an attempted murder)
 in the so-called Patrol No. 603 case. The three former police officers had been con-
 victed in 1996 and sentenced to death for what appeared to be a "social cleansing"
 operation.
 In August a court convicted four men-two former police officers and two former
 members of the military-and sentenced them to 50 years' imprisonment for the
 January 1997 murder of Congressman Joel Salomon Mendoza Pineda and his young
 nephew. The Public Ministry is investigating two members of Congress and the
 mayor of Escuintla as the alleged intellectual authors of the murder.
 On November 30, a criminal trial court in Salama convicted and sentenced to
 death three former PAC members for their roles in the 1982 massacres in the ham-
 lets of Rio Negro and Agua Fria. These massacres resulted in the deaths of an esti-
 mated 250 civilians. The verdict represents the first conviction of the perpetrators
 of a wartime massacre of civilians and sets a key precedent as other massacre cases
 proceed to trial. The evidence presented included information gained from the exhu-
 mation of victims' remains. The defendants appealed their conviction.
 In the criminal case arising out of the 1994 shooting death of University of San
 Carlos student demonstrator Mario Alioto Sanchez, the private plaintiffs appealed
 to the Constitutional Court for the reinstatement of homicide convictions against
 several former senior government officials and others. The Constitutional Court re-
 manded the decision to the Supreme Court, whose decision was pending at year's
 end.
 The trial of 1 officer and 24 soldiers began in Coban on April 21 in the case of
 the October 1995 killing of 11 returned refugees at the Xaman ranch in Alta
 Verapaz by an army patrol. However, only days after the opening hearing, a motion
 by private plaintiff Rigoberta Menchu challenging the competency of the court based
 on several of its evidentiary rulings resulted in the suspension of the proceedings
 until the motion was decided. The trial subsequently resumed in December. The ac-
 cused persons remained in jail pending the completion of the trial. Both the courtfs
 president and the private plaintiffs attorney complained of harassment by unknown
 persons. In addition, the original government prosecutor in the case and his assist-
 ant resigned in October, complaining of a lack of institutional support on the part
 
 
 635
 of the Public Ministry. The prosecutor subsequently left the country, reportedly hav-
 ingbeen the target of threats and acts of intimidation.
 On June 23, the Public Ministry indicted the three high-ranking military officers
 accused of ordering the 1990 murder of anthropologist Myrna Mack. On the same
 day, private plaintiff Helen Mack moved to have the trial judge recused for alleged
 bias, excessive delays, and other irregularities. On September 27, an appeals court
 granted Mack's motion for the recus  of the r  judge, and the case subsequently
 was assigned to another court. A preliminary hearing in the case against the three
 was scheduled for January 1999.
 In December a criminal trial opened, but was immediately suspended until 1999,
 against Vicente Cifuentes, the former PAC member arrested in March 1997 for the
 1985 killings of American journalists Nicholas Blake and Griffith Davis. The au-
 thorities issued arrest warrants for three other suspects, but they remained at large
 at year's end. In January the Inter-American Court of Human Rights found the
 Government culpable in Blake's disappearance and death and ordered the Govern-
 ment to pay Blake's survivors compensation; a damages award is pending. The
 Court also ruled that the Government was obliged to investigate those responsible
 for the murders and sanction them.
 The August 1994 killing by police of three workers at La Exacta farm remained
 under investigation, and the criminal case remained open. In the case before the
 IACHR, the parties attempted to resolve the matter through the IACHR's amicable
 settlement procedures, thus far without success. The Center for Legal Assistance in
 Human Rights is acting as the community's representative in these discussions with
 the Government, through the President's Human Rights Commission (COPREDEH).
 Labor court charges still were pending; the parties met during the year to try to
 negotiate a settlement in that action.
 In the case arising out of the 1993 murder of newspaper publisher and former
 presidential candidate Jorge Carpio, charges remained open against a former PAC
 member, Francisco Ixcoy Lopez, who is at large; an arrest warrant has been out-
 standing since 1995. In 1997 a court convicted former PAC member Juan Acabal
 Pazan and sentenced him to 30 years' imprisonment for his role in the murder. A
 court decision was pending on the private plaintiffs' motion to reopen charges
 against a number of persons-including former senior government officials-be-
 lieved to have participated in the crime as material or intellectual authors, or to
 have assisted in its coverup. There was also a case pending before the IACHR.
 Proceedings continued in the retrial of former military commissioner Candido
 Noriega on 158 criminal charges--mostly for crimes committed in the early 1980's.
 In July a motion by a plaintiff in the case for the recusal of the trial court was de-
 nied, and several of the charges pending against Noriega were dropped. The new
 trial against Noriega was expected to begin in early 1999.
 In the case arising out of the 1994 murder of evangelical minister Pascual Serech
 in Chimaltenango, charges remained pending against military commissioner Victor
 Roman, an alleged collaborator in the crime and also the accused perpetrator of the
 1995 murder of evangelical pastor Manuel Saquic. Roman remained at large despite
 an order for his capture and an offer of a reward.
 There have been about 70 clandestine cemeteries exhumed in the past 5 years.
 Most of the bodies recovered have been those of victims of military or paramilitary
 killings in areas such as Rabinal, Las Dos Erres, and Panzos. Forensics groups are
 using the information obtained from the exhumations to verify eyewitness reports
 of massacres and to determine at least in general who might have been responsible.
 The evidence may be used in some criminal cases; forensic evidence from exhuma-
 tions at the villages of Rio Negro and Agua Fria was introduced into the successful
 prosecution in November of three paramilitary participants in conflict-era massacres
 in those villages. In addition, the Historical Clarification Commission (CEH-see Sec-
 tion 4) solicited the exhumation of several clandestine cemeteries, including those
 at Belen, Acul, and Panzos. In 1997 the ODHAG's Forensic Anthropology Unit ex-
 humed a burial site at Chacalte and found approximately 75 skeletons of victims
 of a massacre by guerrillas in which 200 persons are believed to have died.
 A number ofother past extrajudicial killings remained unresolved, including the
 1989 disappearances of 10 university students, 5 of whom later were found dead,
 and the murder of Miguel Us Mejia, a member of CERJ (an indigenous human
 rights organization), and his wife, Lucia Tiu Turn.
 Intimidation and even the murder of witnesses continued to be a problem. In
 June, for example, Ricardo Molina Guevara, a key witness in a kidnaping case, was
 murdered in an apparent attempt to prevent his testimony. According to press re-
 ports, 26 witnesses who testified in the trial for Pascual Serech's murder were tar-
 geted by threats or acts of intimidation. This trial resulted in the conviction of
 former military commissioner Armando Tucubal in September 1997.
 
 
 636
 There were at least two allegations of politically motivated killings during the
 year, including the murder of Bishop Juan Gerardi on April 26 and of the acting
 mayor of Santa Cruz del Quiche, Luis Yat Zapeta, on May 6.
 The murder of Bishop Gerardi, the Coordinator of the Archbishop's Office on
 Human Rights, occurred just 2 days after his delivery of the final report of the "Re-
 covery of Historical Memory" project, which detailed many of the human rights
 abuses committed during the 36-year-long internal conflict (see Section 4). Because
 the Bishop's murder occurred so soon after his public delivery of the report, which
 held the military, military commissioners, and civil patrols responsible or approxi-
 mately 80 percent of war-related human rights violations, some observers suspect
 a political motive for the crime. The high-profile nature of the case led the Govern-
 ment to establish a high-level commission to support the investigation. The authori-
 ties arrested indigent Carlos Enrique Viebnan on April 30, then released him on
 June 29 due to a lack of evidence linking him to the crime. They also detained the
 parish house cook and then released her on July 28; although murder charges
 against her were dropped, she was still under investigation at years end. The au-
 thorities also arrested the slain bishop's assistant and cooccupant of the parish
 house, Father Mario Orantes, and charged him on October 1 with the murder. Al-
 though the indictment alleged that Father Orantes did not act alone in the crime,
 the prosecutor did not identify other participants. At year's end, the Government's
 investigation of the murder had not yet established the motive for the killing. The
 apparent failure of the prosecutor to investigate all reported leads thoroughly raised
 questions about the efficacy and impartiality of the investigation. In August the
 ODHAG filed a criminal complaint against the prosecutor and his subordinates. The
 lead prosecutor withdrew from the case in December and was replaced.
 On May 6, three armed, masked men murdered Luis Yat Zapeta, the acting
 mayor of Santa Cruz del Quiche, in his home. Yat had been instrumental in the
 removal in February of the municipality's elected mayor, Silverio Perez de Leon, on
 charges of corruption. The authorities arrested three suspects, including municipal
 treasurer Justo Lopez and former mayor Perez de Leon. The murder appears to
 have been carried out in revenge for Yats role in removing Perez de Leon from of-
 fice for corruption. A preliminary hearing in the case was held in late December,
 in which the court found sufficient evidence to bring the three detainees to trial.
 An arrest warrant against a fourth suspect remains outstanding.
 On May 20, the prosecutor for Retalhuleu, Silvia Jerez Romero de Herrera, was
 shot to death in her car; another Public Ministry official traveling with her was
 wounded. Jerez had worked on several sensitive cases, including those relating to
 the kidnaping and murder of Danita Gonzalez, the attempted exhumation of what
 was alleged to be Efrain Bamaca's body, and several serious drug trafficking cases.
 On May 25, the authorities arrested two suspects in Jerez's murder, both members
 of the gang believed responsible for Danita Gonzalez's murder. They both escaped
 from prison in June; however, one was recaptured later. In August the Government
 began investigating five members of the Public Ministry for alleged ties to the gang.
 By September 1, the authorities had removed two of these officials from their posi-
 tions.
 There were a number of reports during the year of alleged "social cleansing" oper-
 ations. These typically consist of cases in which persons deemed socially undesirable
 (e.g., gang members, local delinquents, convicts released from prison) were found
 murdered in circumstances suggesting that the murder was planned and carried out
 by an organized group. MINUGUA investigated 13 possible cases of murders in so-
 cial cleansing operations during the year. Eight confirmed cases of these murders
 took place in La Libertad, Peten, and apparently were perpetrated by a well- orga-
 nized, trained, and armed group that had circulated a list of its intended victims.
 Although the PNC demonstrated an interest in investigating the murders, prosecu-
 tors reportedly accorded the case a low priority.
 Popular frustration with the inability of the Government to control crime, and of
 the courts to assure speedy justice, as well as a tradition of extrajudicial repression
 of crime during years of military rule, contributed to lynchings and mob attacks
 throughout the year. MINUGUJA registered approximately 70 lynchings and at-
 tempted lynchings during the year, in which over 50 persons died. Generally, vic-
 tims were killed by mobs, usually for property-related crimes. For example, on De-
 cember 4, residents of a village near Campur, Alta Verapaz, captured, beat, tor-
 tred, and then burned alive four presumed members of a crimin  gang. There was
 no evidence these mobs were incited for poitical reasons, although MINUGUA iden-
 tiffed cases in which municipal authorities instigated attacks or in which they were
 otherwise involved. Most of the attacks took place in rural areas. The police, some-
 times with the assistance of the military or volunteer firemen, were often successful
 in rescuing victims of mob attacks. The Government opened prosecutions against
 
 
 637
 the instigators of some of the attacks. In May the Government achieved its. first con-
 viction in a lynching case when two defendants were sentenced to long prison terms
 for participating in a lynching in Momostenango. Convictions resulting in lengthy
 prison sentences followed in other lynching cases in August and December.
 b. Disappearance.-There was at least one credible report of a disappearance at-
 tributed to official forces. On February 8, National Police officers in La Union,
 Zacapa, arrested Francisco Gonzalez Vasquez and his companion for brawling with
 other ersons. Although Gonzalez's companion, a minor, was released the same day,
 Gonzalez was not seen again. Witnesses reported hearing screams at the police sta-
 tion the night of February 8. After an internal investigation, the PN concluded that
 its officers in La Union were responsible for Gonzalez's disappearance.
 The PDH's office reported 18 complaints of forced disappearance during the year,
 compared with 30 in all of 1997 and 47 for all of 1996. MINUGUA reported one
 complaint of forced disappearance during the year, compared with three for all of
 1997. The ODHAG reported no forced disappearances during the year.
 Disappearances in high-profile cases from recent years remained unresolved at
 year's end. Arnoldo Xi, an indigenous and peasant rights activist who reportedly
 was shot and abducted in March 1995 remained missing. The whereabouts of
 Lorenzo Quiej Pu, a human rights activist who disappeared in January 1994, also
 remained unknown. Also unsolved was the case of Juan Jose Cabrera (known as
 "Mincho"), the guerrilla commander captured in 1996 while taking part in a kidnap-
 ing, who has never reappeared. MINUGUA concluded that the Presidential Military
 Staff was responsible or his capture, but the media and critics of the Government
 accused them of covering up this finding in the interest of not disrupting the peace
 process. Likewise, there was no clarification of several late-1997 cases reported by
 MINUGUA in which persons believed to have been involved in kidnapings were cap-
 tured forcibly by heavily armed and well-coordinated units that bore many of the
 characteristics of a clandestine security force. The disappearances of San Marcos
 PAC members Margarito Lopez and Obdulio Zapeta, army enlisted man Diego Chel
 Matom, and farmers Ramona Munoz and Maritza Gil, who allegedly were kidnaped
 in 1993 by guerrillas, also remained unresolved at year's end.
 Legal developments in a criminal case failed to shed any light on the fate of guer-
 rilla leader Efrain Bamaca Velasquez, who disappeared following a March 1992
 clash between army and URNG forces. At the last minute, private lawyers pre-
 vented a March 3 effort to exhume a body believed possibly to be Bamaca's; the law-
 yers were believed to represent military officers who may have been implicated in
 Bamaca's disappearance and death. From June 16 to 18, the IACHR held a hearing
 in a case against the Government regarding Bamaca's disappearance. At that hear-
 ing, the Government accepted partial responsibility, to the extent of the judicial sys-
 tem's inability to determine Bamaca's whereabouts. In November the IACHR held
 a further hearing in which six active duty military officers and the former Solicitor
 General testified. Their testimony reportedly failed to further clarify Bamaca's fate.
 Five retired military officers who had been summoned to the hearing failed to ap-
 pear. A decision as to the Government's liability in the case, including a possible
 award of monetary damages, was pending.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution provides for the integrity and security of the person and prohibits
 physical or psychological torture of prisoners; however, there were credible reports
 of mistreatment by members of the security forces. These reports typically involved
 the use of excessive force during arrests or other police operations.
 The PDH's office reported two complaints of torture during the year, compared
 with one unconfirmed case in 1997. The ODHAG reported no cases of torture during
 the year, compared with no cases in 1997, four cases in 1996 and five cases in 1995.
 MINUGUA investigated nine complaints of torture, of which three have been con-
 firmed to date. Some of the complaints investigated in 1998 may relate to acts com-
 mitted in prior years.
 On February 3, two agents of the National Police arbitrarily detained and beat
 a university student when they discovered that he was a demobilized member of the
 URNG. The police authorities subsequently dismissed the two police officers respon-
 sible for the beating.
 Casa Alianza reported that police officers were believed to have beaten or other-
 wise abused three street children. In one case, the officers reportedly beat two chil-
 dren and then brought them to a Guatemala City jail, where they were detained
 temporarily. The officers were identified, and the matter was transferred to the Pub-
 lic Ministry for possible criminal action against the police officers. Through mid-De-
 cember, Casa Alianza reported five murders of street children, none apparently by
 state agents. Casa Alianza and the PDH attribute a number of abuses of street chil-
 dren to drug traffickers, family members, gangs, and, in some cases, private security
 
 
 guards. Since November 1996, the courts have convicted five persons, including two
 police officers and one military officer, of abusing street children. There are at least
 three other pending cases arising out of abuses of street children.
 Reports of police use of excessive force in evictions were infrequent and lower
 than in the previous year. Landless peasants occupied a number of farms through-
 out the year in attempts to gain land. Although some of the invaders were armed,
 the occupations were generally peaceful. Because of violent confrontations in the
 past, the Government's policy was to secure an eviction order from a court, inform
 the occupiers of the coming eviction, and send in a lightly armed police contingent
 to end the occupation. The Ministry of Government carried out numerous evictions
 without incident during the year using this policy.
 Corruption continued to be a problem, and there were credible allegations of in-
 volvement by, as well as the arrest of, individual police officers for criminal activity,
 including kidnaping. However, police authorities appeared to be taking stronger ac-
 tions against officers found to have engaged in illegal activities, referring some such
 violations to the criminal justice system rather than simply imposing administrative
 punishments. The Government continued training and fieldng a new National Ci-
 x~lian Poice to replace the existing National Poice; during the year, members of
 both the PNC and the PN were on duty. Within Guatemala City, the PNC fully re-
 placed the PN. Elsewhere, PNC officers are deployed in some communities; in oth-
 ers, the PN have yet to be demobilized and replaced by the PNC.
 All PNC members must meet minimum education requirements and pass an en-
 trance examination. PN staff wishing to integrate into the PNC have to complete
 successfully a 3-month retraining course. There are also screening procedures in
 place to weed out suspected human rights violators and agents involved in criminal
 activities. New recruits must complete a 6-month training course before entering on
 duty. The training course, developed with the assistance of MINUGUA, foreign
 countries, and international organizations, includes extensive human rights compo-
 nents. However, some observers complained that the-retraining course was insuffi-
 cientiy rigorous and that relatively few members of the PN were screened out dur-
 ing retraining, ensuring the incorporation of some poorly qualified PN members into
 the new PNC.
 Pursuant to the Peace Accords, former members of the military were eligible to
 apply for positions in the PNC but were required to apply like other civilians and
 complete the 6-month training course required of all civilian applicants. However,
 the Government hired some former members of the military and of the former mo-
 bile military police into the ranks of the PNC upon the completion of only the short-
 er course intended for current members of the PN. The former members of the mo-
 bile military police were not subjected to a competitive selection process but were
 screened carefully before they were allowed to enter the program. As of early No-
 vember, the new PNC included approximately 8,500 members, including some ad-
 ministrative personnel; approximately 2,100 PN officers also remained on duty. Al-
 though government plans call for 20,000-PNC members to be on duty around the
 country by the end of 1999, resource constraints may limit that number to about
 18,000 through the year 2000.
 Strong anecdotal evidence indicated an improvement in the probity and effective-
 ness of the PNC in comparison with the PN. Other reports suggested that crime
 rates declined in-some municipalities where the PNC was deployed. Some local gov-
 ernment officials expressed eagerness for the PNC to begin operations in their com-
 munities. As of midyear, the ODHAG reported receiving fewer complaints against
 PNC personnel than had been received in prior years against members of the PN.
 The PNC Academy accepted some 60 police candidates from indigenous commu-
 nities in the Ixil region-a pproximately 30 of whom graduated on their first at-
 tempt-to ensure that PC personnel in those communities are proficient in the
 local language and are able to operate effectively in those communities. The Govern-
 ment planned to implement this practice in other indigenous communities but had
 not yet done so.   o
 In the criminal-case arising out of the 1989 attack on U.S. citizen Sister Dianna
 Ortiz, the authorities stated that in order to accommodate Sister Dianna's reluc-
 tance to return to Guatemala to testify, they had sent her written interrogatories.
 These questions would-permit Sister Dianna to provide testimony before a judge in
 the United -States for use in the criminal proceedings.
 Prison conditions are harsh but not life threatening. The prison system suffers
 from a serious lack of resources, particularly in the areas of prison security and
 medical facilities. The Government reports that prison capacity nationwide is 7,100
 persons, and there were approximately 7,600 inmates at midyear. Many institutions
 were overcrowded; at midyear, the Preventive Detention Center for Men in Guate-
 mala City was approximately 40 percent over its designed capacity. Prisoners also
 
 
 complain of inadequate food. Corruption--especially drug-related-is widespread.
 Prison officials report frequent incidents of escapes and other manifestations of pris-
 oner unrest, and the frequency of jailbreaks became a matter of serious public de-
 bate. In July the Government appointed a high-level commission to consider prison
 reforms and enhanced prison security. Female prisoners are held in facilities sepa-
 rate from men, and minor children are held in other detention facilities. The Gov-
 ernment permits access to prisons by family members.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Despite legal safeguards, there were fre-
 quent credible reports of arrests without judicial warrants, illegal detention, and
 failure to adhere to prescribed time limits in legal proceedings. The Constitution re-
 quires that a court-issued arrest warrant be presented to a suspect prior to arrest
 unless he is caught in the act of committing a crime. Police may not detain a sus-
 pect for over 6 hours without bringing the case before a judge. Once a suspect has
 been arraigned, the prosecutor generally has 3 months to complete his investigation
 and file his case. The law also provides for bail and access to lawyers.
 There are no comprehensive, reliable data on the number of arbitrary detentions,
 although most accounts agree that the security forces routinely ignore writs of ha-
 beas corpus in cases of illegal detention. The ODHAG reported seven complaints of
 arbitrary detention during the year, all of which it was able to confirm. The PDH
 reported 18 complaints of illegal detention during the year. MINUGUA investigated
 some 68 complaints of illegal or arbitrary detention during the year, and had con-
 firmed 40 at year's end (also see Section I.e.). Some of the complaints investigated
 by MINUGUA may have related to detentions carried out in prior years.
 Reliable estimates suggest that 70 percent of all those in prison are awaiting trial.
 Lengthy pretrial detention is not permitted; while the law sets a limit of 3 months,
 longer detentions still occur routinely. Prisoners often are detained past their legal
 trial or release dates. Prisoners sometimes are not released in a timely fashion after
 completing their sentences due to the failure of judges to issue the necessary court
 order.
 In the wake of Hurricane Mitch, President Arzu decreed a 30-day state of public
 emergency, ratified by the Congress, which resulted in the suspension of certain
 constitutional rights, enabling law enforcement officials to detain persons without
 a judicial warrant or without discovering them in the act of committing a crime. On
 November 30, in a controversial move that was questioned by many observers, in-
 cluding MINUGUA, the Government extended the state of emergency for a second
 30-day period. Notwithstanding the temporary suspension of certain constitutional
 provisions, as of mid-December, credible cases of abuse of authority arising out of
 the suspension had not been reported.
 The Constitution prohibits exile, and it is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, although independent, the judicial system often fails to provide fair
 trials due to inefficiency, insufficient funds, and corruption and intimidation of
 judges, prosecutors and witnesses. The courts' response to human rights violations,
 as well as to general criminal activity, has been inadequate, although during the
 year the Government achieved convictions in several important cases involving past
 human rights violations. Members of the judiciary and prosecutors continued to re-
 ceive threats aimed at influencing current decisions or as reprisals for past deci-
 sions. The ODHAG reported eight complaints of threats against judicial officials
 through May. In June unknown assailants fired shots at the house and automobile
 of an assistant prosecutor in Guatemala City. A prosecutor in Retalhuleu resigned
 on July 1, due to fear of reprisals by the criminal gang believed responsible for the
 May murder of prosecutor Silvia Jerez Romero de Herrera (see Section l.a.). A court
 in Amatitlan closed temporarily in July after threats were made against staff mem-
 bers. In June and August, several prosecutors working on high-profile fraud and
 kidnaping cases received death threats. Subsequent to Jerez's murder, prosecutors
 from around the country threatened to strike if they were not provided with secu-
 rity. The Government sought funds to place security guards at public prosecutors'
 offices. A small number of prosecutors handling high-profile cases have been as-
 signed bodyguards.
 The judiciary is composed of a Constitutional Court, a Supreme Court, appellate
 courts, lower courts, and courts of special jurisdiction (e.g., labor courts). The Con-
 stitution provides that Congress elects Supreme Court and appellate court mag-
 istrates from lists prepared by panels comprised of active magistrates, representa-
 tives of the bar association, and law school deans.
 The Criminal Procedures Code, which came into effect in mid-1994, provides for
 the presumption of innocence, the right to be present at trial, the right to counsel,
 plea bargaining, and the possibility of release on bail. Trials are public and verdicts
 
 
 640
 are rendered by three-judge panels. The code also provides for language interpreta-
 tion for those who require it (see Section 5). The Public Ministry, which is independ-
 ent from the executive branch, may initiate criminal proceedings on its own or in
 response to a complaint. Private parties may participate in the prosecution of crimi-
 nal cases as cocomplaintants. Lengthy investigations and frequent procedural mo-
 tions by both defense and prosecution often lead to excessively long pretrial deten-
 tion (also see Section 1.d.).
 Inefficiency and corruption in the courts, Public Ministry, and police continue to
 impede the proper functioning of the judicial system and undermine the right to due
 process. The Supreme Court continued to seek the suspension of judges-and the
 institution of criminal investigations-for improprieties or irregularities in cases
 under their jurisdiction. It is difficult to attract qualified personnel to the courts be-
 cause of the low salaries offered.
 In cooperation with foreign donors, the Government is undertaking major efforts
 to reform the judicial system. In September 1997, the Government formed an inter-
 agency mechanism to coordinate reform efforts among the judicial branch, the Pub-
 lic Ministry, the Ministry of Government, and the Public Defenders Service, the four
 principal governmental institutions involved in the administration of justice. During
 the year, the coordinating body met to draft a unified policy on crime for implemen-
 tation by these institutions. Pursuant to a pilot program, in January five community
 courts were created in primarily indigenous, rural areas to decentralize the adminis-
 tration of justice and incorporate customary Mayan law for minor offenses. In July
 a new public defender service came into effect with the goal of providing effective
 legal representation to indigent defendants, who often had been denied effective rep-
 resentation due to the shortage of public defenders. In August the judiciary began
 implementing a plan to computerize case management, in order to improve judicial
 efficiency, prevent the loss of case files, and decrease the opportunity for fraud in
 court records.
 The Public Ministry has been hampered in its efforts to investigate crimes and
 prosecute offenders by inadequate training and equipment and insufficient numbers
 of investigators. In addition, prosecutors are susceptible to intimidation and corrup-
 tion.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of home, correspondence, and private doc-
 uments, but accusations persist that the authorities sometimes disregard these pro-
 visions. Elements of the security forces reportedly continue to monitor private com-
 munications. Press reports continued to accuse the Presidential Military Staff of
 telephone tapping.
 The military has honored the June- 1994 presidential order to suspend all con-
 scription, including forced recruitment.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech-and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion, and the Government generally respected this right in practice. There were
 some reports of self-censorship.
 In addition to regular and open criticism of government policies, the media pub-
 licizes communiques from human rights organizations, unions, and others opposed
 to the Government or its policies. The press criticizes the military and other power-
 ful sectors. For example, the press reported a number of allegations by politicians
 and others that the Presidential Military Staff continues to monitor private tele-
 phone conversations (see Section 1.f.). The press also published stories on reputed
 drug traffickers and on official corruption.
 In July the military punished Colonel Otto Noack with 30 days' house arrest for
 stating in an unauthorized interview with a foreign radio station that the military
 should admit that during the internal conflict, both it and the guerrillas had com-
 mitted abuses. Some observers in the press and in human rights groups contended
 that the military's punishment of Colonel Noack violated his right to free speech,
 although his unauthorized interview violated military regulations.
 Some journalists claim that in a few particularly sensitive cases government pres-
 sure and fears of reprisal result in self-censorship and limits on investigative report-
 ing. There were allegations early in the year that the Government or those purport-
 ing to speak on its behalf sought to discourage advertisers from buying space or
 time in media outlets deemed hostile to the Government. On March 30, Human
 Rights Ombudsman Julio Arango Escobar issued a ruling criticizing President Arzu
 for restricting press freedom by allegedly trying to stifle criticism from the
 newsweekly Cronica. President Arzu successfully petitioned the Supreme Court to
 issue a stay of Arango's resolution, on the basis that Arango had not solicited testi-
 
 
 mony from the President, as required by the statutes governing the Ombudsman's
 office. This stay subsequently was upheld by the Constitutional Court.
 The Government prepares public information programs, which the radio and tele-
 vision stations are required to broadcast. Opposition parties have no such access to
 the media but can purchase broadcast time. The Supreme Electoral Tribunal, in a
 controversial ruling, characterized as a violation of the electoral law the Govern-
 ment's use of its nightly information program during political campaigns to publicize
 the Governmenfs accomplishments.
 A section of the 1996 Telecommunications Law sought to rationalize the licensing
 of radio frequencies; an unintended effect left a number of tiny local and commu-
 nity-owned stations operating without legal authority. These stations broadcast cul-
 tural, educational, and religious programming to rural communities with large in-
 digenous populations. Although the authorities have the right to close stations that
 have not complied with the new requirements, none have been shut down. Some sta-
 tion owners believe that these requirements restrict their right to free expression.
 The PDH reported one complaint of a threat against a journalist during the year.
 The ODHAG reported 14 complaints of threats against journalists, although it was
 unclear how many of these threats related to the exercise of their profession.
 MINUGUA reported two complaints of threats during the year. In April unknown
 assailants threw two grenades at the home of Amilcar Nuila, a prominent journalist
 based in Coban. Although the house was damaged, no injuries resulted from the at-
 tack; the motive for the attack remains unclear.
 The criminal case in the June 1997 murder of journalist Jorge Luis Marroquin
 Sagastume has not yet gone to trial. The alleged killers are both under arrest. How-
 ever, the victim's relatives have been unsuccessful in having charges filed against
 the crime's alleged intellectual author, Manuel Ohajaca, the mayor of Jocotan.
 The Constitution provides for academic freedom. There were no reports of profes-
 sors or students being subjected to violence or intimidation because of their aca-
 demic work.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly, and the Government respects this right in practice.
 Peaceful demonstrations were common, and demonstrators sometimes occupied gov-
 ernment institutions. In all these cases, the police acted with restraint, and the au-
 thorities negotiated a peaceful departure of the demonstrators.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and the Government re-
 spects this right in practice. The Government did not interfere with political associa-
 tions. However, organizations must obtain legal status, a cumbersome and expen-
 sive procedure. The URNG and several NGO's have alleged that this law particu-
 larly disadvantages organizations representing marginalized social sectors, includ-
 ing indigenous groups. In December 1997, the Congress enacted a statute that
 sought to provide a less cumbersome mechanism for registering civil associations.
 Regulations implementing this statute were adopted in late July.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for religios freedom, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Be-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government gen-
 erally respects them in practice. In October President Arzu temporarily suspended
 constitutional provisions protecting freedom of movement (see Section 1.d.).
 The Government grants refugee and asylee status in accordance with the provi-
 sions of the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967
 Protocol The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (wNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in as-
 sisting refugees from other countries. The issue of the provision of first asylum did
 not arise. There were no reports of the forced return of persons to countries where
 they feared persecution.
 Voluntary repatriation of refugees from Mexico continued. The UNHCR estimated
 that approximately 4,000 refugees returned, bringing the total to approximately
 40,000 since initition of the program in 1993.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 rnent
 Citizens have the right to change their government by peaceful and democratic
 means, through secret ballot and universal suffrage for those 18 years of age and
 older. Members of the armed forces and police may not vote. Since the return to
 democracy and civilian rule in 1985, there have been eight free elections. Inter-
 national observers concluded that both the 1995 general elections and the 1996 run-
 off presidential election were free and fair.
 
 
 Voters elect the 80-member Congress every 4 years using a system of proportional
 representation based on population, with deputies elected both from districts and
 from a nationwide list. Congress has 64 deputies from districts and 16 from the na-
 tional list. The 1995 elections involved 24 political parties; 7 won seats in the legis-
 lature. Congress can and does act independently of the executive, but fragmentation
 along party lines and a weak support structure result in a legislature that is rel-
 atively weak.
 The former URNG guerrillas met all legal requirements for qualification as a po-
 litical party and in December were registered formally; they planned to compete in
 the 1999 generl elections.
 In mumcipal elections held in 30 municipalities on June 8, the ruling PAN party
 won 22 of the races. Although most of the contests appeared to be fair and free of
 fraud, the Board of Elections found sufficient anomalies in the voting in Chinautla
 to annul the election results in that municipality and call a new election. Prior to
 the election, municipal employees improperly issued several thousand civil identi-
 fication cards, enabling large numbers of ineligible persons to vote. The Supreme
 Electoral Tribunal upheld the Board of Election's decision, representing the first
 time in the country's history that an election had been declared invalid. The repeat
 election, held on September 20, produced results similar to the first election and
 independent observers, including MINUGUA, judged it to be free and fair.
 The Government devoted considerable effort in 1998 to implementation of the
 Peace Accords. In October Congress approved a package of 47 constitutional re-
 forms, including almost all of those contemplated by the 1996 Peace Accords. A na-
 tional referendum to approve the amendments is expected to be held in 1999. The
 amendments include provisions to recognize, respect and protect indigenous lan-
 guages and traditional customs, professionalize the judicial service, give civilian
 courts jurisdiction over military personnel, and define the army as an apolitical or-
 ganization. The 1997 demobilization of the URNG guerrillas and the restructuring
 and downsizing of the military helped create a more favorable human rights cli-
 mate. However, although important progress was made, substantial problems re-
 main.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in politics, but women
 are underrepresented in the political arena. Nevertheless, women hold some promi-
 nent political positions. Voters elected 11 women to Congress; women hold 2 seats
 on the Supreme Court; and 1 on the Constitutional Court. Until January a woman
 served as President of Congress; she subsequently became Minister of Education.
 The Constitution provides for equal rights for indigenous people. Some have at-
 tained high positions as judges and government officials, including eight members
 of Congress. Twelve of the 30 mayors elected in the municipal elections are indige-
 nous. Nonetheless, they still are heavily underrepresented in politics due to limited
 educational opportunity and pervasive discrimination (see Section 5). There are no
 indigenous members of the Cabinet.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government permits local human rights groups to operate freely. Numerous
 domestic and international groups investigate and report freely on human rights
 issues. Senior government officials also met with numerous foreign government offi-
 cials and international human rights monitors. While many international human
 rights organizations and their workers do not enjoy formal legal status, they con-
 tinue to operate freely and openly.
 During the year, a number of NGO's credibly reported receiving threats or being
 targeted with acts of intimidation by unidentified persons. Human rights activists
 and jurists working on cases relating to human rights abuses, drug trafficking, and
 other sensitive matters periodically reported receiving threats from unknown per-
 sons. For example, between May and July, CONAVIGUA, an NGO representing
 widows of victims of the internal conflict, reported receiving a number of threaten-
 ing telephone calls, and several of its members reported having been watched, fol-
 lowed, or harassed. On June 22, agroup of armed men attack~ed and robbed a group
 of women and children as they left a meeting of the refugee women's organization
 Mama Maquin in a remote community in the Ixcan. Although the motive for this
 attack remained unclear, the victims believed that it related to their membership
 in the organization.
 On April 24, the Archbishop's Human Rights Office presented the first two vol-
 umes of its "Recovery of Historical Memory" project, which utilizes testimony of wit-
 nesses and other research to document the abuses of the internal conflict. The
 project was begun in 1994, in part to provide input to the CEH, and focused on
 rural communities. The first volume of the report addresses the effects of the vio-
 
 
 lence, including massacres, rapes, and exile. The second volume describes the mili-
 tarys use of disappearances, torture, and massacres as calculated counterinsurgency
 techniques and outlines the intelligence organizations created to provide information
 on targets. The third volume presents the history of the conflict, and the fourth lists
 known victims of the conflict.
 The Human Rights Ombudsman is elected by and reports to Congress, and mon-
 itors the rights provided for by the Constitution. The PDH's rulings do not have the
 force of law. The PDH often rules on controversial issues not normally considered
 human rights topics, such as bus fares and electricity rates. The Ombudsman, Julio
 Arango Escobar, operates with a large degree of independence from other branches
 of the Government. Relations between the Ombudsman's office and the executive
 branch were strained, in part by Arango's ruling against the President in the
 Cronica case (see Section 2.a.). In March President Arzu won a court stay of Om-
 budsman's resolution charging him with violating the freedom of the press. Arango
 complained that the Congress neither funded his office adequately nor implemented
 his recommendations on human rights. The office's lack of funding limited the possi-
 bility of developing adequate investigative capabilities. Upon the expiration of
 MINUGUA's mandate in 2000, the PDH is to take over MINUGUA's human rights
 verification function.
 The President's Commission on Human Rights (COPREDEH) actively sought to
 forge a responsive and cooperative relationship with both domestic and international
 human rights monitors, often acting as a liaison between such groups and other
 branches of the Government. COPREDEH sought to negotiate amicable settlements
 in many cases of past human rights violations pending before organs of the inter-
 American human rights system, rather than litigating such cases.
 The Historical Clarification Commission, created by the Peace Accords in an effort
 to shed light on human rights abuses during past decades, is scheduled to complete
 its mandate on January 31, 1999. The CEH is expected to produce a study of the
 causes, course, and consequences of the internal conflict. Various human rights
 groups gave the CEH extensive documentation of violations and the CEH sought ad-
 ditional information on its own. The CEH has received substantial funding from the
 Government, as well as from international donors. Members of the CEH have criti-
 cized the military, and to a lesser extent the Government, for not delivering all of
 the requested documentation that they believe exists. The military asserts that it
 has provided all existing documentation that was requested. The CEH has no man-
 date to bring to justice those responsible for abuses.
 MINUGUA maintains a staff of approximately 400 with regional offices to monitor
 implementation of the human rights provisions of the Peace Accords and to
 strengthen democratic institutions. MINUGUA states that the Government gen-
 erally cooperated with its investigations but cited occasional isolated incidents in
 which government officials or institutions had obstructed its efforts. The IACHR,
 which conducted a human rights observation visit in August, reported that the Gov-
 ernment cooperated with its mission.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that all persons are free and equal in dignity and rights,
 and that the State must protect the life, liberty, justice, security, peace, and devel-
 opment of all citizens. In practice, however, the Government is frequently unable
 to enforce these provisions, due to inadequate resources, corruption, and a dysfunc-
 tional judicial system.
 Women.-The PDH reported that violence against women, including domestic vio-
 lence, remains common among all social classes. The 1996 Law on Intrafamily Vio-
 lence provided that the Public Ministry, the national police, family courts, legal clin-
 ics, and the PDH can receive complaints of domestic violence. Domestic violence is
 defined as "whatever action or omission by direct or indirect manner causes damage,
 or physical, sexual, psychological or patrimonial suffering" to a person within the
 family group. The law provides for issuing restraining orders against alleged aggres-
 sors and obligates the national police to intervene in situations of domestic violence.
 Victims rarely report criminal sexual violence, although the number of complaints
 of such offenses recently has shown an upward trend. Relatively few rape cases go
 to court, in large part because police have little training or investigative capacity
 for such cases, and because many rape victims are reluctant to report such crimes.
 The law allows a rapist to be exonerated if the victim is between the ages of 12
 and 16, if she consented to sex, if she agrees to marry the man, and if the Public
 Ministry grants its approval of the marriage.
 The PDH reportedthat complaints of spousal abuse have continued to rise due
 to increased nationwide educational programs, which have encouraged women to
 
 
 644
 seek assistance. At year's end, the PDH reported approximately 2,600 complaints
 of domestic violence nationwide. Representative Nineth Montenegro reported to the
 Prensa Libre newspaper that 1,700 cases of violence against women were reported
 to the PNC and the family courts between January and August. Judges may issue
 an injunction against an abusive spouse or companion, and the police are charged
 with enforcing such injunctions. There is also a Women's Rights Department of the
 PDH, and various NGO's provide medical and legal assistance and information on
 family planning. The PDH's Women's Rights Department drafted proposed regula-
 tions to implement the provision of the Law on Intrafamily Violence establishing a
 National Commission for the Prevention of Domestic Violence. At year's end, such
 regulations had not yet been adopted.
 The Constitution asserts the principle of equality between the sexes. Nonetheless,
 in practice, women face job discrimination and on average receive significantly lower
 pay than men. They are employed primarily in low-wage jobs in the textile industry,
 agriculture, retail businesses, and the public sector. More working women than men
 are employed in the informal sector of the economy, where pay and benefits are gen-
 erally lower. Women may own, manage, and inherit property on an equal basis with
 men.
 The National Women's Forum, inaugurated in November 1997, devoted its first
 year to establishing its local and regional network and to developing relationships
 with organizations interested in promoting common goals. The general purpose of
 the forum is to broaden the participation of women in the economic and social devel-
 opment of the country. Local women's groups have elected representatives to the de-
 partmental and national levels. In addition to representatives from the depart-
 ments, the national assembly includes representatives of the various Mayan linguis-
 tic communities. The forum discussed improved access for women to education,
 health care, and credit. The forum serves as a channel for women to make their
 opinions known and to bring about changes in law and administrative practices to
 overcome discrimination and promote a more active role for women in society.
 Children.-The Constitution charges the Government with protecting the physical
 and mental health, as well as the moral well-being, of minors. These provisions not-
 withstanding, the Government in the past has not devoted sufficient resources to
 ensure adequate educational and health services for children. Under the terms of
 the Peace Accords, the Government budgeted substantially more funding for health
 and education in 1998, almost double the 1995 spending level.
 The abuse of street children (see Section 1.c.) is a serious problem in major cities.
 Estimates of the number of street children range between 1,500 and 5,000, with the
 majority of these youths concentrated in Guatemala City. Criminals-reported to in-
 clude private security guards and corrupt police or military personnel-often recruit
 these children into thievery or prostitution rings. The Government and a number
 of NGO's operate youth centers, but the funds devoted to them are not sufficient
 to alleviate the problem. The Government created a Permanent Commission for
 Children and Youth in 1996 to investigate cases of mistreatment. Implementation
 of the new Minors' Code, which would offer greater legal protection to children, was
 deferred until March 1, 2000 due to strong political opposition from certain sectors.
 Opponents, including religious leaders, argued that the code derogated parental
 rights and threatened the integrity of the family.
 The Presidential Human Rights Commission continued weekly meetings of the
 Permanent Commission for Children, composed of representatives from Casa
 Alianza and from the judicial and executive branches, with the aim of addressing
 the problems of street children.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution provides that the State should protect
 disabled persons. Nonetheless, physically disabled persons are discriminated against
 in employment practices, and few resources are devoted to combat this problem or
 otherwise to assist the disabled. However, in 1996 Congress passed a law mandat-
 ing equal access to public facilities, prohibiting discrimination based on disability,
 and providing other legal protections.
 The law defines a disabled person as one whose physical, mental, and emotional
 deficiencies limit performance of normal activities. It stipulates equal opportunity
 for disabled persons in health, education, work, recreation, sports, and cultural ac-
 tivities and provides that all disabled persons receive the benefits of labor laws, so-
 cial security, and have the right to work. The new law also establishes equal edu-
 cation opportunities, the requirement that buildings meet access codes, and the
 right to equal pay. Implementation of the new law has been slow. However, a Na-
 tional Council for the Disabled, composed of representatives of concerned govern-
 ment ministries and agencies, was established and as of September 1, was meeting
 regularly to formulate regulations needed to implement the legislation.
 
 
 Indigenous People.-The Constitution states that the country is composed of di-
 verse ethnic groups and obliges the Government to recognize, respect, and promote
 the lifestyles, customs, traditions, forms of social organization, and manner of dress
 of indigenous people. The Government is obliged to consult with its indigenous pop-
 ulation before enacting any legislation that could affect it. Further, International
 Labor Organization (ILO) Convention 169 provides a legal basis for recognition of
 indigenous legal practices and certain historic claims, along with renewed respect
 for indigenous culture and language.
 Indigenous people constitute over one-half the population but remain largely out-
 side of the country's political, economic, social, and cultural mainstream. Indigenous
 people were the most common victims of extrajudicial killings and other serious
 human rights abuses during the internal conflict. The commissions established to
 discuss the implementation of constitutional provisions relating to indigenous rights
 met during the year to formulate recommendations to the Government regarding
 protection of indigenous culture, languages, traditions, lands, and sacred sites. In-
 digenous people are organizing into interest groups to promote bilingual education,
 .women's rights, and community development. The Government also is devoting in-
 creased resources to bilingual education.
 Rural indigenous people have limited educational opportunities and thus have
 fewer employmnent oppo.rtuties. Many indigenous people are illiterate and do not
 speak Spanish. Lingustic barriers hinder interaction with the Government and
 limit access to public services, including the judiciary, -since few current officials
 speak any of the 21 indigenous languages. In March the Indigenous Languages
 Officialization Commission issued its report, in which it recommended that a variety
 of public services be provided in the four most widely-spoken indigenous languages
 (Kichee, Qeqchi, Main, and Kaqchikel), with a lesser degree of services provided in
 less widely spoken indigenous languages.
 Indigenous persons arrested for crimes are often at a disadvantage due to their
 limited comprehension of Spanish. The Criminal Procedures Code states that the
 courts must provide interpretation for anyone requiring such services during crimi-
 nal proceedings. There are 67 interpreters at all levels of the legal system, from the
 police to the formal courts, to assure non-Spanish speakers the means to bring com-
 plaints, resolve conflicts, and provide testimony. Interpreters are concentrated in
 former conflict areas of the country; more interpreters were in training. In January
 five community courts were created in primarily indigenous, rural areas to decen-
 tralize justice and incorporate customary Mayan law for minor offenses.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the Labor Code provide work-
 ers with freedom of association and the right to form and join trade unions. The
 Government does not control unions. Major reforms to the Labor Code in 1992 man-
 dated steps to improve worker rights by facilitating freedom of association, strength-
 ening the rights of working women, increasing penalties for violations of labor laws,
 and enhancing the role of the Labor Ministry and labor courts in enforcing the stat-
 utes. All workers have the right to form or join unions, including public sector em-
 ployees, with the exception of members of the security forces.
 At most, 8 percent of the work force, or 250,000 of 3.1 million workers, are mem-
 bers of labor organizations. The 1,500 registered unions and nearly 450 company-
 sponsored "solidarity organizations" in the country are independent of government
 and political party domination. Labor Code amendments have simplified the procss
 for unions to obtain legal status. The Minister of Labor further revised the a
 trative process in May 1996, reducing the number of steps within the Ministry for
 consideration of union applications and establishing strict timetables; the time for
 the procedure was reduced to 20 days from 60. The Labor Ministry also has initi-
 ated a program to assist unions with their applications, and the Minister has
 warned officials that noncompliance with the timetable could lead to dismissal of
 those responsible for the delay. These new regulations have accelerated the approval
 procedure and largely eliminated the backiog of union applications. The Labor Min-
 isr granted legal status to 276 unions during the year.
 The 20-day processing rule was not implemented in one high profile case involving
 banana workers attempting to organize in the eastern part of the country. Early in
 the year, the workers on two banana farms owned by BANDEGUA (Del Monte
 Fresh Produce) but managed by a private individual tried to unionize. While both
 BANDEGUA and SITRABI (the union that represents 3,500 workers on
 BANDEGUA owned and managed farms) were willing to negotiate, the individual
 manager resisted and went so far as to bribe a local inspector to alter records in
 the case. The labor inspector was eventually fired, and at year's end the farms in
 question were being transferred to a new manager. The Minister of Labor personally
 
 
 sought to intervene in this particular dispute but his efforts to achieve a negotiated
 settlement were thwarted by management.
 Workers have the right to strike, but Labor Code procedures for having a strike
 recognized as legal are cumbersome. Labor organizers criticize the requirement that
 two-third of the work force must approve a vote to strike, the prohibition of strikes
 by agricultural workers at harvest time, and the right of the Government to prohibit
 strikes that it considers seriously harmful to the national economy. In 1996 Con-
 gress approved a law that further restricted the right to strike for workers employed
 in. essential public services. Unions strongly opposed the law, and some members
 ofCongsscalledthemeasureunconstitutionaland contrarytocommitmentstothe
 ILO. The law deems such services as urban and interurban transport, mail, and
 telegraph as essential; the Constitutional Court reviewed this law in 1996 and de-
 clared it constitutional in January 1997.
 Although the public sector historically has been the scene of frequent strikes, al-
 most always called without legal authorization, there were no public sector strikes
 during the year. (Several were threatened.) The Government declared illegal a 1996
 strike by judicial workers; the workers eventually resumed their duties and were
 paid for the time that they were on strike, a common outcome of such strikes. Pre-
 viously, the Government made no effort to intervene on the basis of a strike's ille-
 gality. The new essential services strike legislation permits the Government to act
 more forcefully but has not been tested. Employers may suspend workers or fire
 them for absence without leave if the authorities have not approved their strike le-
 gally. The strike regulation law calls for binding arbitration ]an impasse has been
 reached after 30 days of negotiations.
 The law protects workers from retribution for forming and participating in trade
 union activities, but enforcement of these provisions is spotty. Wbile an increasing
 number of employers accept unionization, many routinely seek to circumvent labor
 code provisions in order to resist union activities, which they view as historically
 confrontational and disruptive. An ineffective legal system and inadequate penalties
 for violations have hindered enforcement of the right to form unions and participate
 in trade union activities. While workers ilegally fired for union activity should,
 under the Labor Code, be reinstated within 24 hours, employers often file a series
 of appeals, or simply defy judicial orders of reinstatement. Penalties for defying such
 orders were increased somewhat in the 1992 Labor Code reform and again in Decree
 35-98, which went into effect in June.
 Trade union leaders and members did not suffer labor-related violence. Some pub-
 lic sector union leaders reported receiving threats against themselves and their fam-
 ilies. Investigations continued into previous years' cases of violence, including mur-
 der, against various labor leaders, although some of these investigations appear to
 have been suspended for lack of evidence.
 An active "solidarity" movement claims approximately 170,000 members in nearly
 450 companies. Unions may operate legally in workplaces that have solidarity asso-
 ciations, and workers have the right to choose between the two or to belong to both.
 The Government views these associations as civic organizations that need not inter-
 fere with the functioning of trade unions. The amended Labor Code stipulates very
 clearly t trade unions have an exclusive right to bargain collectively over work
 conditions on behalf of workers. However, unions charge that management promotes
 solidarity associations to avoid the formation of trade unions or to compete with ex-
 isting labor unions. There are credible reports that some of these associations did
 not always adhere to democratic principles in their formation and management, and
 that workers are unable to participate fully and freely in decisionmaking. Similar
 credible charges are made against some trade unions.
 At the request of trade union leaders, the independent Human Rights Ombuds-
 man, through its office for economic and social issues, receives complaints related
 to trade union activities. Union leaders and workers filed occasional complaints with
 the PDH during the year, and the Ombudsman has spoken out in public statements
 about labor conditions in various sectors of the economy. The PDH can investigate
 union complaints and issue a statement, but the office has no enforcement powers
 beyond attempting to ameliorate the situation through publicity and moral persua-
 sion.        d      n    ao
 Unions may and do form federations and confederations and affilat with inter-
 national organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.Workers have te  i  to or-
 ganize and bargain collectively. However, the practice of collective barganing is lim-
 itd by the weak structure of the unio movement, the requirementuthat 25 prcent
 of the workers in a factory or business must be union members in order for collec-
 tive bargaining to take place, the lack of experience with this practice, and the pref-
 erence of management in many cases to avoid formal ties with trade unions. While
 
 
 both management and the unions honored some well-written collective contracts, in
 other instances both parties openly ignored and violated contracts. Most workers,
 even those organized by trade unions, do not have collective contracts to cover their
 wages and working conditions but do have individual contracts as required by law.
 Most workers receive the minimum wages established by bipartite commissions,
 which operate under the guidance of the Ministry of Labor.
 Employers legally cannot dismiss workers for helping to form a trade union; work-
 ers file complaints in this regard with the labor inspectors for resolution. The Labor
 Code provides for the right of employers to fire union workers for cause, permits
 workers to appeal their dismissal to the labor courts, and requires the reinstate-
 ment within 24 hours of any union worker fired without cause. The revised Code
 prohibits employers from firing workers for union organizing and protects them for
 60 days following the official publication of approval of the union. It also prohibits
 employers from firing any member of the executive committee of a union and pro-
 tects them for an additional 12 months after they are no longer on the executive
 committee. An employer may fire a member of the union's executive committee for
 cause only after a trial and issuance of a court resolution.
 Despite some improvements, labor courts responsible for enforcing labor laws con-
 tinued to be generally ineffective. Efforts to restructure and modernize the labor
 court system have made some headway. In addition to 7 labor courts in the capital,
 an additional 13 have been established and are functioning in other parts of the
 country. An additional 9 courts deal with labor issues as part of their jurisdiction.
 Nevertheless, a heavy backlog of labor cases continues to clog the courts due to inef-
 ficiency and lack of resources, especially competent judges. There is only spotty en-
 forcement of the Labor Code, due to the scarcity of labor inspectors, continuing
 though declining corruption, the lack of adequate training and resources, and struc-
 tural weaknesses in the labor court system. However, enforcement is improving as
 new labor inspectors complete training and begin work at the 21 branch offices out-
 side the capital, allowing the Ministry of Labor to increase significantly its rate of
 inspections and to fire some of the incompetent or corrupt inspectors. The Ministry
 continued a series of inspections at farms and plantations in rural areas, and cited
 those employers who were not paying the minimum wage.
 The Ministry of Labor reorganized its labor inspector corps to permit some com-
 plaints to be heard at the Ministry of Labor rather than requiring that inspectors
 travel to each work site. The Ministry increased the number of court cases filed for
 failure to comply with the Labor Code and has begun an educational campaign on
 worker rights (especially the rights of minors and female workers), including provid-
 ing some documents in indigenous languages. In an effort to improve enforcement
 of the Labor Code outside the capital, the Ministry of Labor has begun to decentral-
 ize its operations, opening a branch office in Coban, Alta Verapaz, in addition to
 the 21 labor inspector branch offices.
 Labor laws and regulations apply throughout the country, including in the few ex-
 port processing zones (EPZ's). The laws governing the EPZ's are not discriminatory
 on the subject of organizing trade unions or collective bargaining. Union leaders
 often blame employer pressures and their unofficially restricted access to the EPZ's
 for their virtual inability to organize workers in these zones. While labor standards
 in the EPZ's are no different from those found outside the zones, actual working
 conditions are often better.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution bars forced or
 compulsory labor, and the practice does not exist. The law does not specifically pro-
 hibit forced or bonded labor by children, but they are covered by the general statute.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Con-
 stitution bars employment of minors under the age of 14 without written permission
 from the Ministry of Labor. However, children below this age regularly are em-
 ployed in the informal and agricultural sectors, usually in small family enterprises.
 The law prohibits minors from night work and extra hours (the legal workday for
 minors under the age of 14 is 6 hours; for minors 14 to 17 years of age, it is 7
 hours), from working in establishments where alcoholic beverages are served, or
 from working in unhealthy or dangerous conditions, but children are employed in
 the illegal cottage-based fireworks industry. Laws governing the employment of mi-
 nors are not enforced effectively, due to the shortage of qualified labor inspectors
 and structural weaknesses in the labor court system. Approximately 4,000 minors
 have permission from the Labor Ministry to work legally, but thousands of others
 who work without legal permission are open to exploitation. They generally receive
 no social benefits, social insurance, vacations, or severance pay and earn below-min-
 imum salaries. The Ministry has actively sought to reduce the number of permits,
 and it issued approximately 1,200 in the first 10 months of the year.

 The Labor Ministry has a program to educate minors, their parents, and employ-
 ers on the rights of minors in the labor market. However, economic necessity forces
 most families to have their children seek some type of employment to supplement
 family income, especially in rural and indigenous communities. Children who work
 generally do so in family enterprises. There is no forced or bonded labor of children
 (see Section 6.c.). There are no export industries in which child labor is a significant
 factor.
 The Constitution provides for compulsory education for all children up to the sixth
 grade. However, less than half the population actually receives a primary education.
 Chidren in rural and indigenous areas are less likely to complete primary school.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Although the law sets minimum wages, the le-
 gally mandated minimum wage for most unskilled and semiskilled workers is not
 always paid. A bipartite committee representing labor and management in specific
 economic sectors is named each year to make recommendations for increases in the
 minimum wage. In the event that agreement is not possible, the Government may
 decree such increases. The most recent minimum wage increase took effect in De-
 cember 1997. The basic rate is $3.03 (19.71 quetzals) for industrial workers for an
 8-hour workday, including a required hourly bonus, and is $2.75 (17.86 quetzals) per
 day plus mandatory productivity bonuses for agricultural workers. The minimum
 wage is not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family.
 According to the United Nations Development Program, at least 80 percent of the
 population lives below the poverty line, including approximately 60 percent of those
 employed.
 The legal workday is 8 hours, and the workweek is 44 hours, but a tradition of
 longer hours remains in place due to economic conditions. The amended Labor Code
 requires a weekly paid rest period of at least 24 hours. Trade union leaders and
 human rights groups charge that workers sometimes are forced to work overtime,
 often without premium pay, in order to meet work requirements. Labor inspectors
 report uncovering numerous instances of such abuses, but the lack of stiff fines or
 strong regulatory sanctions, as well as inefficiencies in the labor court system, in-
 hibit adequate enforcement of the law.
 Occupational health and safety standards are inadequate. As with other aspects
 of the labor law, enforcement of standards that do exist is also inadequate. When
 serious or fatal industrial accidents do occur, the authorities generally take no legal
 steps against those responsible. The Labor Ministry provides training courses for
 labor inspectors in health and safety standards but does not accord them a high pri-
 ority due to scarce resources. The Government does not effectively enforce legisla-
 tion requiring companies with more than 50 employees- to provide on-site medical
 facilities for their workers, although most large employers do provide such facilities.
 Workers have the legal right to remove themselves from dangerous workplace situa-
 tions, and the law provides them with protection for their continued employment.
 However, few workers are willing to jeopardize their jobs by complaining about un-
 safe working conditions.
