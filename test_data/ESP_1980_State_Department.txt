 SPAIN
 The present evolution of human rights in Spain must be
 viewed in the context of the long dictatorship of
 General Francisco Franco (1936-75). The Franco regime
 effectively denied the Spanish people the exercise
 of their human rights through the full panoply of
 authoritarian mechanisms, including censorship, restric-
 tions on freedom of speech and banning of opposition
 parties and non-sanctioned labor unions. Although eco-
 nomic growth in the 1950's and 60's brought a new measure
 of prosperity to Spain, the regime remained at base an
 authoritarian government.
 Following the death of General Franco in 1975, Spain has
 undergone a rapid and successful transition to democracy.
 All elements of Spanish society -- including the King,
 the Catholic Church and all major political parties -- are
 committed both in principle and in practice to the
 realization of a democratic Spain where human rights are
 protected. Basic freedoms of speech, press, religion,
 assembly, movement and participation in the political
 process are respected in Spain. This transition has
 occurred despite the complexities of building a new
 democracy in the presence of a significant terrorist
 element.
 During 1980 the government has continued to give life and
 form to its commitment to democratic norms and to the
 protection of human rights both at home and abroad.  At
 home, the government has continued to take steps to
 reconcile laws and institutions carried over from the
 Franco era with the provisions of Spain's new democratic
 constitution, which was formally adopted in December 1978.
 A natural consequence of the transition has been that some
 earlier laws remain on the books, but they are being
 systematically rewritten. On the international front,
 Spain has emerged as a spokesman for human rights, perhaps
 most visibly through its hosting of the Madrid meeting of
 the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE),
 which entails a full discussion of the human rights records
 of all European countries.
 There are no emergency or decree laws in effect in Spain.
 In conformity with Article 55, Section 2 of the constitu-
 tion,_the Parliament has approved a new anti-terrorism
 law which suspends certain constitutional guarantees in
 an effort to combat terrorism. The law provides that,
 with the-assent of a judge, a prisoner charged with a
 crime in association with a terrorist group or with
 offering support or apology for terrorism can be held for
 up to ten days incommunicado, his home may be searched,
 his mail opened and telephones tapped. The law provides
 that the judge may ask for reports on the treatment of
 prisoners held under these provisions and must review
 the suspensions of rights periodically to decide whether
 they may continue. It also provides that the government
 must report to the parliament every three months on the
 application of the law.
 
 
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Article 15 of the constitution guarantees the right to
 life and to physical and moral integrity. It specifi-
 cally forbids the use of torture.
 Reports of torture have been received from several parts
 of the country. Amnesty International has just issued
 a report in which it cites fourteen cases of maltreatment
 or torture of prisoners and has made recommendations
 for improvement of treatment of prisoners to the Spanish
 government. The Amnesty International report also makes
 the point that the human rights record in Spain is much
 improved over that of the previous regime.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment is formally
 prohibited by Article 15 of the constitution. The death
 penalty is also abolished except in those cases which
 may be established by military penal law in time of
 war. While law enforcement authorities generally respect
 the law and the rights of the accused, there have been
 reports of maltreatment. Maltreatment is not condoned
 by the government, and such reports are investigated.
 Prison conditions and treatment of prisoners are good.
 Prisons are clean; health care is adequate; food is satis-
 factory; and prisoners are permitted to receive visits
 from family members and attorneys of their choice. In
 addition, representatives of the International Red
 Cross have access to detainees. The media have also been
 allowed access to prisons. Prisoners are treated
 equally,and there is no differentiation made among iypes
 of prisoners.
 c. Disappearances
 There are no known cases of abduction, secret arrests
 or clandestine detention by official or quasi-official
 security forces or by elements condoned by the regime.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Article 17 of the constitution prohibits arbitrary
 arrest and imprisonment. It also provides that there
 be maximum periods of preventive detention (72 hours);
 that an arrested person must be informed of his rights,
 including the right to an attorney, and that a detainee
 is entitled to an explanation of the reason for his
 arrest. Such rights and prohibitions, including habeas
 corpus, are respected in practice by law enforcement offi-
 cials. In the case of terrorists, these rights are
 modified by the anti-terrorism law, as noted above.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is guaranteed by the
 constitution (Article 24) and respected in practice. The
 full range of defendants' rights are also provided for and
 protected in practice. The courts are independent of
 executive and military control.
 
 
 There are no credible reports of exceptions to the right
 to fair public trial. This year has seen its fair share
 of sensational trials, all of which have received exten-
 sive media coverage and been open to the public while being
 conducted in strict accordance with the law. There is
 no martial law in any province.
 Article 117 of the Spanish constitution states that, "The
 law shall regulate the exercise of military jurisdiction
 within a strictly military framework," thus ending
 jurisdiction of military courts over civilians. Legisla-
 tion to implement this constitutional provision was
 passed in October 1980 in order to bring all regulations
 and procedures on this subject into accord with the
 constitution.
 Prior to the passage of the above implementing legislation,
 the military charged a film producer for "disrespect
 for the Armed Forces" and the editor of a prominent Madrid
 daily for alleging in his paper that some military officers
 were plotting a coup d'etat. Six youths were tried (five
 were acquitted) for sedition for encouraging military
 recruits to seek weekends off and free bus transportation.
 The military has appealed the acquittals.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 While Article 18 of the constitution states that "the home
 is inviolable" and that "no entry or search may be made
 without legal authority," Article 55 permits an organic
 law to suspend this provision in individual cases. The
 anti-terrorism law does so, but only with judicial inter-
 vention and legislative control, "for certain persons
 with respect to investigations having to do with the
 activities of armed bands or terrorist elements." Some
 entries have occurred in the Basque region under this law.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 The government of Spain is committed to providing the basic
 economic needs of its citizens. The Spanish constitution
 specifically guarantees the right to work, the right to
 own property and rights to food, shelter, health care and
 education in accordance with the Universal Declaration of
 Human Rights. Accordingly, education, pensions, health
 care, and social security expenditures represent about 30
 percent of total central government expenditures. A
 separate social security budget, financed primarily by
 employer and employee contributions, almost equals the
 entire government budget. The Ministry of Education budget
 has been the largest ministry budget for the past several
 years.
 Over 90 percent of Spain's population (33 out of 37
 million) is covered one way or another within the scope
 of the social security system. Social security is the
 largest single provider of health care in Spain,. Over
 80 percent of Spain's 65,000 doctors participate in the
 social security system. The scope of health services
 is comprehensive. Pharmaceuticals are subsidized, with
 the effect that beneficiaries either receive prescription
 
 
 877
 drugs free or at less than half cost. Per capita gross
 domestic product (GDP) is just under $5,000, life
 expectancy at birth is 72 years, infant mortality is 16
 per thousand live births, and literacy is 90 percent.
 Currently the Spanish economy is suffering from a combina-
 tion of external constraints and domestic structural
 problems which reduced the level of economic growth to
 less than one percent in 1979 and an estimated growth of
 between minus one and plus one percent for 1980. Inflation
 is running at an annual rate of 15 percent, declining very
 slightly from the 15.5 percent of 1979 and 16.5 percent
 of 1978. The balance of payments will probably show a
 deficit on current account of about 4.5 billion dollars
 in 1980 after two years of surpluses in excess of 1 billion
 dollars each year.
 Unemployment stands at 11 percent and is rising, with over
 1.4 million Spaniards out of work; however, the sting of
 joblessness is moderated by an unemployment insurance
 system which provides from 60 to 80 percent of a worker's
 base salary in benefits for up to 18 months. The system
 only covers about half the unemployed, since first-time
 job seekers and agricultural day laborers are not covered.
 Construction of housing is a key element in the government's
 program to reinvigorate economic growth. The national
 housing plan has the goal of constructing 571,000 low-cost
 housing units between 1981 and 1983. This program aims
 both at meeting housing shortages in many urban areas and
 holding down growth in unemployment, since housing construc-
 tion is relatively labor intensive.
 Women suffer discrimination in Spain with regard to equal
 pay for equal work and with regard to access to jobs. In
 one recent case a number of women lost their jobs after
 taking maternity leave. The oarliament is currently dis-
 cussing measures to rectify this loophole in current
 labor legislation.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 All are protected specifically by the constitution.
 While the press in Spain is actively free and independent,
 even aggressively so, there have been several cases of
 judicial action against the media in the last year.
 Three major cases have been against a) Juan Luis Cebrian,
 editor of a Madrid daily, who was tried by civilian court
 for "disrespect to the courts" and sentenced to two
 months in prison (which was suspended because it was his
 first offense) and a fine. b) Pilar Miro, a movie
 director and producer, who was charged by the military
 with disrespect for the Armed Forces because of her
 film about an incident in the 1930's in which three youths
 were sentenced to death for allegedly killing a policeman.
 With the recent passage of legislation more narrowly
 defining the competency of military courts under Article
 117 of the constitution her case will pass to civilian
 courts, should the government decide to prosecute her.
 c) Miguel Angel Aguilar, editor of a Madrid newspaper,
 was charged by the military with disrespect for the Armed
 Forces after his newspaper published a story alleging coup
 plotting in the military. His case, like Pilar Miro's,
 
 
 878
 now is pending. These cases illustrate the evolution from
 Franco-era legislation, some of which is still on the
 books, to laws in accord with the new constitution.
 Despite such cases, the press is active in publicizing
 instances of possible human rights violations.
 There have also been isolated cases of magazines being
 seized but usually after the edition was fully sold out.
 While in some cases the reason for the order to seize a
 magazine has never been given, in other cases reasons have
 ranged from pornography to disrespect.
 The constitution specifically protects the right of free
 assembly and this right is used by all groups. Unions
 are permitted to organize, strike and bargain collectively
 under Article Seven of the constitution. Trade unions
 are fully active.
 There is no state religion and "freedom of ideology,
 religion and cult of individuals and communities is
 guaranteed." This freedom is fully respected in practice.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Spain has been actively involved in resettlement of
 refugees. It accepted a group of 1000 Indochinese and
 has successfully integrated them into the society.
 The Spanish have also accepted 500 Cubans from the
 Peruvian Embassy in Havana. They have for many years
 been resettling Cuban refugees in Spain.
 Women are not subject to different rules in internal
 or foreign travel, emigration or repatriation. Minor
 children require the permission of both parents to get a
 passport.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The political system is a democratic multi-party system
 with universal suffrage in which opposition parties
 operate freely and with access to the media. Based on
 an elected parliament, free speech and the full range of
 other democratic norms, Spanish democracy is lively and
 meaningful to the man in the street.
 under the constitution, women are guaranteed complete
 equality in Spain. Societal factors, however, still work
 against women in seeking employment, gaining equal oppor-
 tunity and pay, etc. Women nonetheless are represented in
 all walks of life and take part in the political process
 actively. Women are increasingly vocal and organized, and
 change is occurring.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged viola-
 tions of Human Rights
 The Government of Spain has voiced no objection to outside
 or internal investigations of the human rights situation
 in Spain. Amnesty International has again this year visited
 Spain and has released a report of its findings. The
 press, as noted before, reports fully on incidents which
 come to its attention. Spain is hosting the CSCE review
 conference in Madrid in which there will be a full dis-
 cussion of the human rights records of European countries.
