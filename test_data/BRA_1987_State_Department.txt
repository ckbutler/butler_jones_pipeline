 BRAZIL
 Brazil returned to democratic rule in 1985, after 21 years of
 military-dominated governments. Jose Sarney, chosen as Vice
 President by the electoral college in January 1985, became
 President 4 months later following the death of the
 President-elect.
 A new congress was freely elected in November 1986, with the
 participation of 30 political parties. The Congress,
 functioning as a Constituent Assembly, began to draft a new
 Constitution in February 1987. Although not yet completed,
 the broad outlines of the new Constitution are clear; it will
 continue to provide for a federal republic, but it evidently
 will enlarge the authority of the legislature and the judiciary
 and will broaden individual rights.
 Internal security is provided by the military as well as by
 federal, state, and local police. The Armed Forces now have
 more of an external orientation, but nevertheless are employed
 internally in the event of a threat to public order or to
 protect critical industrial installations during emergency
 situations. The Brazilian judiciary is a respected and
 independent institution and sought to ensure that citizens
 were accorded protection under the law even during the two
 decades of military rule.
 In 1986 Brazil's gross domestic product grew by 8.2 percent in
 real terms; but this figure is expected to fall to
 approximately 3.5 percent in 1987. Brazil has the eighth
 largest economy outside the Communist bloc and also has the
 largest foreign debt in the developing world--over $110
 billion. In February 1987, Brazil announced a moratorium on
 the interest payments on its medium- and long-term debt to
 foreign commercial banks. Since then, trade has improved, and
 Brazil is expected to register another large trade surplus for
 1987.
 Although political rights are protected in Brazil today,
 problems remain in other human rights areas--most notably in
 the treatment of peasants involved in land disputes, common
 criminals, and Indians. Common criminals in the custody of
 police are frequently beaten, and some criminals not in
 custody are killed anonymously. These phenomena are not new,
 but their frequency apparently is increasing. These incidents
 have received considerable public attention in the past year
 due to the increasing assertiveness of local human rights
 organizations and the press, as well as growing public concern
 about criminal violence.
 Under the current civil code, Brazilian Indians are considered
 "semicompetent" wards of the State. They live under certain
 restrictions and protections not applicable to other citizens.
 Indians on many reservations are subject to pressure from
 mineral and agricultural developers and squatters seeking
 access to Indian land, especially in areas where land
 ownership is often unclear.

 previous record of over 200 registered in 1986. Most of the
 dead were rural laborers, CONTAG (National Confederation of
 Agricultural Workers) officials, and lawyers- or clergy involved
 in helping to organize agricultural worker-unions. As in 1986,

 southern -part, of-:Para State- 181- landre-lated deaths- occurred
 during an 8-month period near the town of Conceicao do Arguaia.
 Rural labor union organizers were frequently the assassination
 targets. ,,Te, Pastoral.Lan iCommision (CPT) of the Catholic
 Church compiled a list of 125 agrarian'reform supporters
 threatened with death because of their activities. The list
 includes 10 Catholic bishops, 31 priests,, i0nunsi and 2
 deputies f-rom Para State.-,Also threatened. were presidents of
 ruratl labor- unions,- lawyers, and-CPT' rural labor organizers.
 In June Pawtlo Fontelles, legal advisor to-the Confederation of
 Rural Laborers of Para,. former State-Deputy-in Para State, and
 member- of the Communist Party of Brazil, was killed in an
 apparently- professional attack by two. gunmen. Fontelles was
 also the lawyer representing 30 workers in southern Para
 accusaedof killing Tal-ey de Andrade, son of a local landowner.
 No-suspeotsthave yet been arrested in'the'case. Government
 authoritiear-have expressedsexious concern over-the violence,
 but the -Fedecalaovernment asserts thatit does not have the
 legal authority,to intervene unless asked to do so by the
 state government, ..-In its 19.8-7 Report, which covers -the year
 1986, Amnesty International (AI) said-it believed "the apparent
 unwillingness of local, state, and federal authorities'to
 investigate these killings effectively and to prosecute those
 responsidle could constitute acquiescence in these crimes."
 In Rio de Janeiro and other major urban centers, there is a
 renewed and growing-problem of "death'squad" or "extermination
 group":activities, i.e., summary executions of alleged or
 suspected criminals by unidentified persons. Hundreds of such
 deaths-occurred in 1987; often the corpses revealed signs of
 previous torture or brutality. The killings are apparently
 not attributable to a single source, but most of them occur,
 or at least the bodies are discovered, in the poorer
 
 
 400
 BRAZIL
 neighborhoods. Given the rising crime rate, it is-believed
 that a large number of petty criminals are marked for
 elimination by local merchants who hire former policemen or
 security guards (a system called "Policia Mineira"). Struggles
 among groups of criminals themselves are also an important
 cause of the deaths, mostly narcotic traffickers involved in
 gang wars. Investigations into these incidents are hampered
 since witnesses are not forthcoming for fear of reprisals.
 Assumed informal links of these groups to elements within the
 police makes the problem even more difficult for state
 authorities. In Rio, in 1987, the naming of a new civil
 police secretary identified as being a foe of police abuses,
 was accompanied by an unexplained wave of about 100 killings
 the following week. Such large numbers of killings in short
 periods have occurred regularly, suggesting some level of
 organization. Elements within the police may well view such
 summary executions as a way of coping with the inefficiency
 and inadequacy of the judicial and penal systems. Contract
 killings and "death squads" are active in many of Brazil's
 urban centers. These phenomena constitute a growing problem
 nationwide. In its 1987 Report, AI said it had examined
 reports "that the frequent use of lethal force by police in
 certain urban areas suggested a pattern of deliberate killings
 of criminal suspects who were often unarmed and many of whom
 were juveniles."
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated abductions.
 The Ministry of Justice announced in December 1986 that the
 Government's human rights council would set up a commission to
 investigate the "disappearances" of 125 so-called political
 prisoners between 1964 and 1977 under previous military
 Governments.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by the penal code, and there were no
 reports of politically motivated torture in 1987. The new
 Constitution is likely to strengthen the legal penalties for
 torture and acquiescence in torture, making it an unbailable
 and unpardonable crime. Most Brazilian human rights
 organizations assert that police beatings, and even torture,
 of prisoners are widespread. They claim that police beatings
 are common upon arrest, at police stations, and within
 prisons. It is believed that police corruption often leads to
 torture intended to extract confessions or money and sometimes
 to administer punishment. Beatings also are often viewed as a
 form of summary justice meted out to suspected criminals.
 Human rights organizations claim that such treatment is
 inflicted primarily upon the poor and the underprivileged.
 The decline in beatings and torture noted by church
 authorities in 1983-84 has apparently been reversed.
 Police brutality toward suspected criminals appears to be a
 problem throughout Brazil. These abuses apparently continue
 because of a perception by the police that they can act with
 impunity as their supervisors tolerate such behavior. In
 virtually every instance in which police officers have been
 brought to trial, they have been acquitted. In one of the
 most publicized cases, in fact, a group of police officers
 accused of torture was found innocent by the courts in Porto
 Alegre for lack of proof, despite-photographs showing the
 alleged act of torture. The prisoner who claimed to have been
 
 
 BRAZIL
 tortured was killed by unknown assailants after his release
 just 3 weeks before he was,.to testify against his assailants.
 Another victim, in-the same case went into hiding and did not
 testIfy;.:In.l987 the acqui-tted pQlic  officers filed suit

 Human rights organizations find little public support for
 defending the rights of alleged criminal offenders. Public
 criticism of the judicial system is'dixected not at -the abuse
 of persons in detention nor at the dismal prison conditions
 but rather -at the lack of efficient law enforcement.
 Most lr:iaon faciities are poorly maintained and managed. .
 Very little-prison construction has taken place in Brazil in
 recenI years, although some states claim-to-be planning future
 prison.cont.uction.    -
 The independent panel thit :ilkestigated the'September 196
 rebe lliqn.at San-Paulo!s Prepidente Venceslau prison determined
 that the state military police were responsible for.the deaths
 of 14 pKisoners,- The-panel concluded that the rebels had not

 These groups claimed to iave. irrefutable evidoce-,that many
 prisoners,were qummarily--executed.,after surrendering. The
 official inveatigation-was still under way at the end of 1987.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Under the law; a.-peison may-not, be arbitrarily detained. The.
 Constitution provides for j~dicial determination of the
 legality of detention, and this provision is.respected.
 The law permits provisional detention in exceptional'
 circumstances when ogdered by judges, in the case of common
 crimes, or when-ordered by certain high-level administrative
 authorities in instances of crimes involving public
 administratiQn -(such as embezzlement) or--extradition.
 Detention, also may. be ordered if there are sufficient
 indications that the-accused might try to escape or interfere
 with. the normal development of criminal.proceedings, as for
 example when the accused might try to influence or harm a
 witness.. Provisional detention can be extended-until the case
 comes to trial or until a- judge rules that reasons for the
 detention no longer exipt. Provisional detention in Brazil
 generallyis not practiced arbitrarily.
 Forced or compulsory.labor is not tolerated by the Government,
 but abuses by private individdals have come to'light from time
 
 
 402
 BRAZIL
 to time. In 1986, federal authorities arrested labor
 contractors in several northeastern and Amazon states for
 maintaining "slave" work forces; employers deducted
 transportation and other expenses from salaries and prevented
 workers from leaving the property. Government authorities
 investigated reports of similar cases in the States of Para
 and Rondonia in 1987, but no arrests were made.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is ensured by law and is
 generally respected in practice. Defendants are entitled to
 counsel and must be made fully aware of the charges against
 them. In cases where a defendant cannot afford an attorney,
 one must be provided free of charge. In practice, there are
 too few public defenders, and private attorneys are appointed
 by courts to represent poor defendants where public defenders
 are unavailable. This system, combined with the usual
 slowness of the Brazilian judicial machinery, contributes to a
 backlog that can cause delays of months, or even years.
 Defendants and their attorneys have the legal right to be
 informed of the evidence on which charges are based. Only
 cases of willful crimes against life are tried by jury; all
 others are tried by a single judge.
 The "summary executions" and apparent "extrajudicial killings"
 seemingly arise from the tradition of settling personal scores
 by hiring assassins, societal toleration of public corruption,
 poorly paid and untrained public safety forces, fear and
 outrage concerning criminal assaults, and the public perception
 that the judicial and penal systems cannot cope with the rising
 crime rate.
 Lynchings of suspected criminals by irate citizens continued
 in 1987, and 38 mob lynchings were registered by the Ministry
 of Justice in the first 6 months of 1987. The phenomenon was
 most common in the State of Bahia and other areas of
 northeastern Brazil. Lynching victims often were street
 muggers caught in the act of committing a crime. Most
 observers agree that such mob lynchings also arise from public
 rage against crime, combined with the popular perception that
 police protection is ineffective and that the courts do not
 put criminals behind bars.
 The judiciary is an independent branch of Government. The
 federal judicial system includes courts of first instance and
 appeals courts. The Federal Supreme Court is the highest
 court in Brazil. The states are free to organize their own
 judicial systems, so long as they do not violate basic
 principles in the Federal Constitution. Brazil also has a
 system of specialized courts dealing with military, labor,
 elections, and juvenile matters, among others.
 The military court system hears cases involving military
 personnel and also civilians charged under the National
 Security Law, or charged with offenses against military
 installations. Civil legal guarantees also apply in military
 courts. Both civilians and military personnel have the right
 of appeal to the Federal Supreme Court when convicted in a
 military court of crimes against the National Security Law.
 The National Security Law has been invoked in only a handful
 of instances since the end of military rule. President Sarney
 amnestied two civilians detained and charged under the
 National Security Law for an alleged attempt against the

 Labor has the-right-to orginize, and trade unions are legally
 mandated to represent workers.- .Although the labot code makes
 no provision for a central labor organization, three such
 groups have emerged.'.-To maintain the countty's50-year-old
 corporate labor structuteI the Government taxes workers 1
 day's pay per:year, .dividing.80 percent of the proceeds among
 recognized union:licals, federations, and national'sectoril
 confederations. The Governmentuses the remaining 20percent
 to,-findnce Brazil's unemployment insuranice program. In -
 addition .to this tax, 15-to 20-percent of workers voluntarily-
 pay union-dues-to have access to union-provided recreational "
 and health benefits. Unions are legally prohibited from
 participating in partisan-politics, but nevertheless, many are
 politiclly active; The labor movement, acting as a united
 force, heavily lobbied members of the Constituent Assembly in
 an effort to incorporate trade union and worker guarantees
 into the'new Constitution.
 Corporatist,era legislation that outlaws most strikes remains
 on the books, but the Government has chosen not to invoke the
 law's.more restrictive features. In addition, the Government
 has restored the right to hold union office to labor leaders
 punished under the military regime. The Government encourages
 labor and management to resolve differences through collective
 
 
 404
 BRAZIL
 bargaining and attempts to conciliate particularly difficult
 disputes. A system of special labor courts provides an
 alternative to collective bargaining.
 The Government employed military troops to remove farm
 equipment from a highway during a farmers' demonstration. On
 several occasions, the military was also used, on grounds of
 national security, to contain labor unrest at oil refineries
 and ports which threatened oil supplies and exports.
 Labor unions and employer associations are permitted to
 maintain ties with international organizations, but each
 affiliation must be approved by the President of the Republic.
 Due to exchange controls, the transfer of funds to pay
 membership fees requires Central Bank approval.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no favored or state religion. An overwhelming
 majority of Brazilians belong to the Roman Catholic Church,
 which maintains an active social and political program with no
 government intervention. However, spiritism has many
 adherents, and Protestantism has been expanding in recent
 years. All faiths are free to proselytize, establish places
 of worship, and train clergy. The National Council of
 Brazilian Bishops continues to complain that visas for
 missionaries and other foreign religious personnel are being
 systematically delayed by immigration authorities. Plans to
 revise the 1980 immigration law have been postponed because of
 the Constituent Assembly's work on the new Constitution.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within Brazil, nor are
 there any restrictions on emigration. Brazil admits few
 immigrants, does not formally accept refugees for resettlement,
 and is selective in granting asylum. Brazil's new Constitution
 may include a provision that will facilitate applications for
 political asylum.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of
 Citizens to Change Their Government
 On March 15, 1985, Brazil returned to democratic rule with the
 inauguration of its first civilian president in 21 years.
 With the acquiescence of military leaders, two civilian
 presidential candidates had been nominated: Paulo Maluf, a
 former governor of Sao Paulo, with close ties to the military-
 dominated government, and Tancredo Neves, a long-time civilian
 opposition leader. Tancredo Neves was chosen President, and
 Jose Sarney, his running mate, was chosen Vice President in
 indirect elections. Sarney became interim president when
 Neves was hospitalized for emergency abdominal surgery on the
 eve of his inauguration. Upon Neves' subsequent death, Sarney
 assumed the presidency.
 The military-inspired 1967 Constitution concentrated effective
 political power in the presidency, including the right to
 issue decree-laws in a number of key areas and to decree a
 state of siege, permitting suspension of many civil rights in
 the event of war or threat of serious disturbance. Several
 important constitutional amendments approved by the Federal
 Congress in 1985 removed authoritarian restrictions and
 returned Brazil to full democratic status. Direct mayoral
 
 
 BRAZIL
 elections were held in all state capitals in 1985. National
 elections were held in November 1986 to elect state governors,
 the Federal Congress, apd state legislative assemblies.
 Thirty parties representing a broad political spectrum
 participated-in theelections.
 The-direct. election of Federal congressmen and senators in
 November 1986 produced a representative Congress. Acting also
 as a Constituent Assembly, it has been moving to augment its
 own powers under a new Constitution. State governors in
 Brazil have been elected by direct popular vote since 1982, as
 have all municipal and state officials--and most Federal
 legislftors. Voting is secret, and it is mandatory for all
 literate Brazilian citizens, age 18 and older. Under the
 currdnt Constitution, the illiterate cannot vote. The new
 Constitutio to. be promulgated in 1988 is expected to make
 voting mandatory for adults (age 18-60). Voting is expected
 to be voluntary-for the illiterate, for those over age 70, and
 possibly for minors (16-17 years). Military conscripts do not
 have the right to vote.
 Section-4 governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are a number of Brazilian nongovernmental organizations,
 such:as the National Bar Association and the Brazilian Press
 Association,. which actively investigate allegations of human
 riglhts violations and often initiate legal proceedings. AI
 maintaids offices in Rio and Sao Paulo. None of these
 organizations have complained of government interference in
 their activities. With the return .of democratic government to
 Brazil, human rights groups previously copcerned with
 political repression have increasingly turned their attention
 to human Sights problems involving police mistreatmeht of
 suspected criminals, poor prison conditions, urban "death
 squadst" and rural violence including the assassinations of
 peasants involved in land disputes.
 In its 1987 Report, AI noted that an AI delegate visited
 Brazil in October 1986 to investigate torture and
 ill-treatment in various--prisons and police stations in four
 major cities. it said ithad-no replies from either the
 President or. the state governor to its written inquiries
 submitted as, a result of-this investigation.
 Sinqe 1985 a federal prosecutor in each state has been
 designated to monitor- and assist in denunciations of human
 rights violations. qnactive under the military government,
 the Federal Council for the Defense of Human Rights, a
 presidential advisory group,-resumed its activities in 1986.
 Encouraged by the Federal Ministry of Justice during 1987,
 many states established their own Council for the Defense of
 Hu~nan Rights. These councils, include government officials and
 representatives of nongovernmental human rights organizations..
 Theyinvestigate specific allegations and serve as clearing"
 houses for information concerning human rights violations.
 The various human rights councils, frequently communicate
 directly with one another.
 Section, 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination on the basis of sex and'race is illegal.
 Although not sanctioned by law or the Government, women and
 
 
 406
 BRAZIL
 racial minorities still encounter substantial discrimination
 in Brazil. The proportion of women and blacks in the
 professions, or in positions of authority, is much smaller
 than their relative share of the population, a reflection of
 history, cultural attitudes, and economic disparities. Women
 are proportionally well represented among university students.
 The vast majority of the black population is concentrated in
 the lowest economic stratum.
 The country's estimated 300,000 Indians, living mostly in the
 interior, have suffered from government neglect and from the
 impact of greater contact with non-Indians as Brazil's internal
 frontier expands. Despite the Government's responsibility
 under the 1973 Indian Statute to protect the indigenous
 population, Indians continue to receive only minimal
 assistance. The Indian Affairs Agency is attempting to
 demarcate tribal lands, as isolated tribes come into conflict
 with non-Indians moving into nearby areas. The land disputes
 are getting more violent each year. Indian leaders believe
 the Government has ignored their needs and claim the Government
 is more concerned about the exploitation of mineral and other
 natural resources than attending to the demands of Indians.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The minimum age for employment is 12, but numerous legal
 restrictions theoretically apply to all working minors under
 age 18. Permission of parents or guardians is legally
 required for minors to work. Children from ages 12 to 14 are
 legally allowed to work only if provision is made for them to
 attend school through the primary grades and only in light
 work that does not constitute a physical strain. All minors
 are barred from night work and are prohibited from employment
 in unhealthy, dangerous, or morally harmful conditions. These
 laws do not extend to occasional employment performed by
 millions of children and adolescents. Thirty-four percent of
 all children between the ages of 10 and 14 are considered
 economically active, and 65 percent of Brazilians between the
 ages of 15 and 17 are employed.
 Brazil's highly detailed labor code includes regulations
 governing workplace safety, establishing a 48-hour workweek,
 specified periods of rest and vacation, and a national minimum
 wage. Enforcement of the detailed safety regulations varies.
 Through collective bargaining, many local unions have brought
 the workweek down to 46 or 44 hours. Government agencies tend
 to rely more on education and persuasion than on coercion to
 limit industrial hazards and pollution in both urban and rural
 settings. This tactic has not always been successful.
 The minimum wage is constitutionally defined as that amount
 "able to satisfy the normal necessities of the worker and his
 family" (of three dependents). High inflation dramatically
 decreased the worker's real earning power in 1987, even though
 the Government decreed periodic wage increases. At year's end
 the minimum wage was fluctuating between $40 and $45 per month.
 According to 1986 data from the Brazilian Institute of
 Geography and Statistics (IBGE), 42 percent of those
 economically active, including minors, earned no more than the
 equivalent of one minimum salary. Nearly 13 percent earned
 less than half this amount. A Sao Paulo foundation, whose
 financing is derived from a trade union, calculates that to
 satisfy the normal necessities of a family of four the minimum
 wage should be set at an amount at least eight times the
 current figure.
