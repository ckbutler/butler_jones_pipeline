 SRI LANKA
 Since Sri Lanka achieved independence three decades ago,
 successive governments have maintained a steady commit-
 ment to human rights. Control of the government has
 changed hands peacefully following each of the six free-
 ly contested general elections since independence. Suc-
 cessive governments have successfully implemented pro-
 grams to increase literacy and educational levels, im-
 prove health and nutritional standards and re-distribute
 income. Sri Lanka's commitment to human rights has sur-
 vived the trauma of an insurgency and two major outbreaks
 of communal violence. The Constitution promulgated in
 1978 guarantees basic human rights.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited in the new Constitution, and there
 are no reports of its occurence.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been occasional unsubstantiated accusations
 of police brutality. Such practices are prohibited by
 the Constitution and are not condoned by the Government.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 There are no reports of arbitrary arrest or imprisonment.
 The Constitution specifically provides that no person
 shall be arrested, held in custody, imprisoned, or detain-
 ed except in accordance with the law. The present Govern-
 ment's actions during the August 1977 communal violence
 are evidence of its commitment to such constitutional guar-
 antees. The violence in August 1977 grew from a minor in-
 cident into nationwide strife that claimed 150 lives and
 generated 50,000 internal refugees. In quelling these
 disturbances, the Government arrested nearly 5,000 per-
 (627)
 
 
 628
 sons under legal procedures. All were brought before a
 magistrate within 24 hours and were freed, granted bail,
 or remanded. Most were released on bail within a few
 days of their arrest. Almost all of those remanded by
 a magistrate were released on bail within one month of
 their arrest. The others were tried under normal judicial
 procedures.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In November 1977 the'Government repealed legislation adop-
 ted following a 1971 insurgency that altered Sri Lanka's
 normal judicial procedure of fair public trials. That
 legislation had empowered a Criminal Justice Commission
 to try insurgents, using evidence inadmissible in a normal
 civil or criminal proceeding and without a right of
 appeal. The 137 insurgents who had been convicted and
 sentenced under this legislation were released in conjunc-
 tion with its repeal.
 c. Invasion of the Home
 Homes cannot be searched without a search warrant. This
 right can be suspended only if a national emergency is
 declared. The Government dealt with the August 1977 com-
 munal violence without declaring an emergency, and home
 searches took place only by warrant.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Government has an excellent record in meeting the
 social and economic needs of the people. Health Care is
 accessible to all; education is universal; the literacy
 rate is 85 percent; and life expectancy is 67 years.
 Food subsidies are provided to the poorest segment of
 the population. These economic and social benefits are
 available to citizens and non-citizens, the Sinhalese
 majority and the Tamil minority alike.
 Sri Lanka has long been commited to the creation of a
 democratic socialist state, a policy confirmed by the
 present Government. Income distribution has become more
 
 
 629
 equitable in recent decades. In 1963, the top ten percent
 of the population earned 39 percent of total income, com-
 pared to 30 percent in 1973. The bottom 40 percent earned
 twelve percent of total income in 1963 and fifteen percent
 in 1973.
 The commitment to social and economic welfare by successive
 Sri Lanka governments has not been without its costs. The
 stagnation of the economy and the unemployment rate of 20
 percent are at least partial consequences of the alloca-
 tion of a large proportion of government resources to wel-
 fare programs and subsidies rather than to investment in
 production. The current Government has reduced government
 subsidies, stimulated economic growth, and provided en-
 hanced opportunities for private enterprise.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 The freedoms of thought, speech, publication, religion and
 assembly are guaranteed by the 1978 Constitution. While
 the Constitution of 1978 gives Buddhism a preferred posi-
 tion among religions, there is no indication that in prac-
 tice this works to the detriment of other religions. The
 Government controls two of the four major newspaper groups
 and owns the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. There is
 an active discussion of local and international affairs
 with expression of differing viewpoints in these and other
 media. With the exception noted below, independent news-
 papers criticize the Government, although they object to
 subtle governmental pressures which constrain their criti-
 cism.
 There is no direct censorship, with minor exceptions. In
 May 1978 the Government passed a one-year law proscribing
 the Tamil Liberation Tigers, a small terrorist group de-
 dicated to the creation by violence of an independent Tamil
 state, and permitting the Government to censor press cover-
 age of proscribed organizations. The law is intended to give
 the Government control over media coverage which might in-
 flame communal passions. In 1978 the National State As-
 sembly also passed a Parliamentary Powers and Privileges
 
 
 630
 Act with provisions for disciplining journalists judged
 by the Assembly to be guilty of impugning the veracity or
 dignity of members of varliament.
 The Fundamental Rights Article of the 1978 Constitution
 formally extends for ten years the same rights of thought,
 speech, religion and assembly as enjoyed by citizens to
 resident non-citizens, the "Indian" Tamils who number
 .approximately one million.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of movement within the country and the right to
 choose one's place of residence are guaranteed by the Con-
 stitution and permitted in practice. Foreign travel and
 emigration are not restricted.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political power has changed hands six times since indepen-
 dence in 1948. The elections, including the most recent
 in July 1977, have been open and campaigning has not been
 restricted.
 An exception to the strong record of free political partici-
 pation is the Civic Disabilities Act of August 1978, which
 for seven years disqualifies 34 politicians and former
 government officials from voting or holding judicial office.
 These disqualifications were imposed on grounds of breach
 of public trust. The 34 are also barred from being em-
 ployed in national or local government service or in any
 state corporation or other state institution. The legis-
 lation makes provision to recover from them any losses sus-
 tained by local authorities as a result of their actions.
 There may be a review process and disqualifications may be
 lifted from those persons against whom the evidence does
 not clearly support the charges.
 4. Government Attitudes and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Government Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Sri Lankan governments generally have been receptive to
 international investigations of human rights conditions.
 
 
 631
 The previous Government at first welcomed Amnesty Interna-
 tional's investigation of its handling of the detention of
 insurgents in 1971, but later quarrelled with the assess-
 ment of its detention policies. As noted above, however,
 all detainees were either released or tried, and all those
 convicted and sentenced have now been released.
