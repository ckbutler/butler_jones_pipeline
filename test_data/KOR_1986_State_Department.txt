 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 President Chun Doo Hwan dominates the political scene in the
 Republic of Korea. The elected legislature has limited power
 but considerable influence on public opinion. President Chun,
 a former army general, assumed power with military support in
 1980, when martial law was declared and civil disturbances in
 Kwangju harshly confronted. The Constitution was adopted by
 referendum in October 1980 under strict martial law
 conditions, leading many Koreans to question the referendum's
 fairness. President Chun has promised. to step down in early
 1988, when his term of office ends, to provide for a peaceful
 and constitutional change of power,
 Korea's sociopolitical tradition emphasizes order, conformity,
 and a subordinate role for women. These attitudes retain
 great strength, coexisting uneasily with Western democratic
 ideals. Citing this tradition and faced with a heavily armed
 Communist North Korea that invaded the South in 1950 and that
 remains committed to bringing the entire peninsula under its
 control, successive South Korean governments have given top
 priority to maintaining external and internal security. The
 successive regimes have implemented their policies in part by
 employing large, well-organized security forces. Many Koreans
 have charged throughout the years that the very real threat
 from the North has been used as a pretext to suppress internal
 opposition, despite the democratic ideals professed by all
 South Korean leaders.
 Koreans enjoy considerable personal freedom, including
 economic and religious freedom, and broad rights to pursue
 private interests. Although the Constitution guarantees
 freedom of speech and press, in practice both are abridged.
 During the past 20 years, Korea's export-oriented economy has
 achieved one of the world's highest growth rates and a
 twenty-fold increase in per capita gross national product.
 The population is urbanized and well educated. Abject poverty
 has been largely eliminated. The rapid growth of the economy
 has created a growing middle class with increasing access to
 education and wealth. The university student population has
 increased sharply over the past decade. Students have joined
 with other groups to become a strong voice for fuller
 political participation and greater freedom to express
 political views.
 The issue of constitutional reform dominated Korean politics
 in 1986. In February the opposition launched a petition
 campaign in support of its demand that the Constitution be
 amended to provide for direct popular election of the next
 President. The Government initially declared the campaign
 illegal and sought to block it, placing some opposition
 leaders under house arrest. The Government subsequently
 moderated its position, but the opposition party continued to
 apply pressure by staging a series of large public rallies
 throughout the nation. In late spring President Chun
 responded by agreeing to negotiations between the political
 parties in the National Assembly to amend the Constitution.
 The government party proposed creating a parliamentary system
 of government while the main opposition party insists on a
 directly elected President. At the end of the year the debate
 remained stalemated with both sides seeking to bolster popular
 support for their positions.
 The Government continued to take a hard line towards
 dissident, particularly student dissident, political activism
 
 
 745
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 in 1986, citing increasing radicalism and violence. As the
 year progressed, student protest slogans became increasingly
 revolutionary and in some instances closely paralleled North
 Korean propaganda. Approximately 3,400 persons were jailed in
 connection with political activities, some of them violent.
 In December well over 1,000 persons remained in custody for
 politically related offenses. For the first time under the
 present Government, an opposition Assemblyman was indicted and
 jailed in connection with the distribution of the text of an
 Assembly speech the Government claimed violated the National
 Security Law in its criticism of the Government's unification
 and anti-Communist policies. In 1986 there continued to be
 numerous charges of police mistreatment of prisoners including
 credible allegations of torture in some cases.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were unconfirmed reports that the deaths of several
 persons said to be critical of the Government or engaged in
 opposition political activity may have been at the hands of
 the police or other government security agencies. In one case
 involving the death of a military reservist in police custody,
 there were charges that he died as a result of beatings by
 police or military officials after making remarks critical of
 the Government. The Minister of Home Affairs told the
 National Assembly that the reservist died of acute renal
 paralysis while in police custody on charges of violating the
 law on assembly and demonstrations. In the other cases,
 including the deaths of a university student and a worker,
 which the police announced were suicides, some opposition and
 human rights groups expressed suspicions of official
 culpability.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports_ of disappearances in 1986.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 In 1986 there continued to be credible reports of torture and
 cruel treatment. The Constitution prohibits torture, and the
 Government insists that it has issued and strictly enforces
 injunctions against it. In addition, in 1983 the National
 Assembly passed a law increasing sentences for those convicted
 of killing or injuring through torture.
 Nonetheless, during 1986 there were plausible charges of
 serious prisoner mistreatment. In one such case, a female
 dissident, Ms. Kwon In Sook, claimed that she was sexually
 assaulted by a policeman during interrogation. The Government
 denied the sexual assault charges but dismissed the policeman
 from his post for improper and "excessive" conduct. Korean
 human rights groups and political opposition leaders also made
 plausible charges that a number of students, workers, and
 others in politically related cases were subjected to various
 degrees of physical maltreatment. These groups charged that
 some 15 labor activists were interrogated and tortured by the
 Korean Military Security Agency. Another group of dissidents
 charged with publishing seditious literature allegedly was
 
 
 746
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 beaten by police. The Government denied these allegations.
 Yet another dissident activist, Kim Keun Tae, made credible
 charges that he had been severely tortured in 1985, but the
 Korean Supreme Court upheld his conviction on appeal and
 refused to "recognize" his claim that he had been unlawfully
 mistreated by police.
 The use of excessive force by the police continues to be a
 pervasive and ingrained problem. Demonstrators have been
 beaten on apprehension, often by plainclothes police. On the
 other hand, riot police generally were well disciplined when
 confronting protesters who were themselves often extremely
 violent. Police acted professionally in 1986 when U.S.
 officials requested that officers physically remove students
 who had invaded a U.S. facility.
 Charges of police beatings occur fairly frequently in
 nonpolitical cases and are sometimes reported in the press.
 For example, in late 1986 the media reported the acquittal of
 a murder suspect who claimed he had been tortured into making
 a false confession.
 Conditions in Korean correctional institutions are austere,
 especially in winter because cells are unheated. Discipline
 is strict. Prisoners of whatever sort who break rules or
 protest conditions are sometimes beaten. Prisoners may
 receive visits only from their lawyers and immediate
 families. Their mail is monitored and at times censored.
 There does not seem to be a difference between the overall
 treatment of political and nonpolitical prisoners, but in 1986
 reports of conflict between prisoners jailed for
 antigovernment activities and prison authorities increased.
 Opposition and prisoner family groups have claimed that
 prisoners had been beaten and subjected to other mistreatment
 because of their political views. The Government denied this
 and insisted that prison authorities were only exercising
 necessary minimal force to deal with prisoner defiance of
 authority.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arrest warrants are required by law but sometimes are not
 produced at the time of arrest in politically related cases.
 In one case, a defendant charged with "praising North Korea"
 was acquitted on the grounds that his confession had been made
 while he was detained without an arrest warrant. In 1985 the
 Supreme Court ruled that police may not detain persons for
 more than 48 hours without warrants. An indictment is
 supposed to be issued within 30 days after arrest. Within 3
 days after making an arrest, the police are supposed to notify
 an arrested person's family or lawyer of his detention and
 whereabouts. This requirement is not always observed,
 particularly in cases of detention by security agencies other
 than the National Police. For example, in the case of a group
 of labor activists who were interrogated and allegedly beaten
 by the Defense Security Command, there are credible reports
 that the suspects' families were not informed of the
 detentions for over a week. The Constitution also guarantees
 the right to prompt legal assistance and to a review of an
 arrest by a court.
 Habeas corpus, not traditional in Korean law, was introduced
 after World War II, abolished in the 1970's, and reintroduced
 in 1980. It does not apply to those charged with violations
 of the National Security Law or laws governing crimes
 
 
 747
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 punishable by at least 5 years' imprisonment. Most political
 offenses are, therefore, excluded. There is a system of bail,
 but it does not apply to offenses punishable by 10 or more
 years' imprisonment. In 1985 the Government adopted a new
 policy to compensate persons held for questioning who are
 subsequently found innocent by prosecutors, and the courts
 have started to apply this provision. In 1986 a Korean court
 awarded damages to a man who was injured when he refused a
 policeman's request that he "voluntarily" accompany the
 policeman to the police station for questioning. There was
 criticism from the press and legal groups of excessive numbers
 of false or unjustified arrests.
 Dissidents who openly criticize the Government are sometimes
 picked up and detained for short periods and then released.
 In 1986 there were instances of dissidents returning from
 overseas trips being detained in such fashion, as were several
 journalists who had written politically sensitive articles.
 From time to time the security services have not only detained
 persons accused of violation of laws on political dissent but
 have also increased surveillance of or put under various forms
 of house arrest those they think "intend to violate the law."
 Korea's Public Security Law permits measures including
 "protective surveillance," "residential restriction," and
 "preventive custody" of certain persons considered likely
 lawbreakers. Such restrictions were used against opposition
 political figures, including the leaders of the main
 opposition, the.New Korea Democratic Party (NKDP), in early
 1986 in an effort to stop the petition campaign for
 constitutional revision. During this period, opposition
 politician Kim Dae Jung was not permitted to leave his home
 for 12 days. Kim and others also were confined to their homes
 for briefer periods on numerous other occasions.
 The Government also takes a sweeping approach to crime
 prevention in instances where its image is involved. Korean
 police investigated 263,564 suspected criminals in a 3-month
 drive to tighten security for the September Asian Games held
 in Seoul. Some 48,000 persons were formally charged, and more
 than 76,000 summarily sentenced to up to 29 days in jail.
 Most others were released.
 In 1986 the Government continued to investigate dissident and
 student organizations and to make arrests for national
 security law violations for activities characterized as
 pro-Communist, pro-North Korea, or anti-State. Government
 critics claim that in many of these cases the National
 Security Law was misused to suppress domestic, particularly
 student, dissent. There were also charges that the Government
 was identifying student activists for immediate conscription
 into the armed forces. (Military service is required of all
 Korean males, but students normally are given deferments to
 complete their educations.) Other students picked up for
 participating in antigovernment demonstrations were required
 to complete "reorientation programs" before being released.
 Some 1,200 students underwent such programs in the first half
 of 1986. More than 900 were judged to have successfully
 completed the program and were released.
 For persons deemed "socially dangerous," the law allows
 preventive detention under provisions of the Social Protection
 and Social Stability Laws. Under the Social Protection Law, a
 judicial panel may order preventive detention for a fixed term
 of 2 years, which can be extended by the panel for additional
 
 
 748
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 2-year periods. The Social Stability Law allows for a
 preventive detention term of 7 to 10 years through
 administrative litigation. The Government maintains that
 these laws are aimed at chronic offenders and prisoners who
 are mentally ill.
 There is a "preventive custody center" in the city of Chongju
 where prisoners judged to be insufficiently repentant are held
 following the completion of their original prison
 sentences.    Soh Joon Shik, whose original 7-year sentence
 ran out in 1978, and Kang Jong-Kon, whose original 5-year
 sentence was completed in 1981, are two political prisoners
 believed to be held in Chongju. Although the Government has
 not released figures on the total number of persons under
 preventive detention, some human rights groups assert that as
 many as 380 prisoners are being held under Social Stability
 Law provisions.
 There were no reports in 1985 of forced labor as defined by
 the International Labor Organization (ILO),
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution guarantees many rights to defendants:
 presumption of innocence, protection against
 self-incrimination, freedom from ex post facto laws and double
 jeopardy, the right to a speedy trial, and the right to legal
 counsel. These rights generally are observed. Trials, with
 some exceptions, must be held within 6 months of arrest. In
 Seoul, trials usually begin within a month after indictment,
 although in 1986 the large number of student protesters
 awaiting trial slowed the process somewhat.
 The President appoints the members of the Supreme Court, whose
 Chief Justice in turn appoints lower-court judges. There is a
 three-tier system for criminal cases: district court,
 appellate (high) court, and the Supreme Court. The judiciary
 is considered independent in ordinary criminal and civil cases
 but much less so in politically sensitive cases. A new Chief
 Justice was appointed in 1986. Upon assuming his post, he
 emphasized his intention to strengthen the protection of human
 rights.
 In several politically sensitive trials in 1986, public
 attendance was restricted. The defendants sometimes were
 removed from the courtroom for attempting to disrupt the
 proceedings. In other cases, the defendants attempted to
 boycott the trial proceedings, stating that they did not
 recognize the court's authority or impartiality. Judges
 generally allow great scope for examination of witnesses by
 both prosecution and defense, but they often deny defense
 requests to call witnesses to discuss the political or
 ideological leanings of the defendants, even when the
 prosecution has introduced evidence on such topics.
 Trials usually are open to the public, but trial documents are
 not part of the public record. Charges against defendants in
 the courts are clearly stated. In lengthy and complex
 indictments, however, the relationship between specific acts
 alleged and violations of particular sections of the penal
 code is not always clearly drawn. In cases involving a
 mixture of political and criminal charges, this lack of
 clarity can bring into question the fairness of the
 proceedings. The same courts try political and ordinary
 criminal cases. Military courts do not try civilians.
 
 
 749
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 Defendants have the right of appeal in felony cases, a right
 often exercised and frequently resulting in substantial
 reductions in sentences. Death sentences are automatically
 appealed, and the sentences often not carried out.
 The list of political prisoners maintained by the Human Rights
 Committee of the National Council of Churches of Korea and the
 opposition New Korea Democratic Party (NKDP) included from
 1,000 to nearly 3,000 names throughout 1986. It reached a
 high following the arrest of 1,287 participants in the violent
 seizure of buildings on a Seoul campus in October; 395 of
 these students were subsequently indicted and the rest
 released. In December the NKDP put the number of political
 prisoners in Korea at 1,843. This number included persons
 indicted, but not yet tried as well as those already
 convicted. The majority of these persons are students
 arrested since 1985, including some who advocated or used
 violence.
 While continuing to deny that it holds any "political
 prisoners," the Government did make public several times
 during the year the number of persons being held in connection
 with the "political situation." In December, government
 prosecutors announced that 3,405 persons had been arrested in
 1986 in connection with political activities, including campus
 demonstrations such as the seizure of buildings at Konkuk
 University in October. The total included 2,919 students, 919
 workers, 146 "dissidents," and 240 "ordinary citizens."
 Prosecution sources said that as of mid-December, 1,480
 persons, including students, remained under arrest, and police
 were searching for another 150 persons suspected of
 politically related offenses. The release of political
 prisoners was the subject of debate and negotiation in the
 National Assembly. According to the Government, 36 persons
 convicted of politically related offenses were released in a
 special clemency in August, and indictments against a number
 of others were suspended over the course of the year.
 According to government statistics, most political offenders
 in 1986 were charged with violating the law on assembly and
 demonstrations in connection with protests ranging from
 peaceful participation in the opposition's petition drive for
 constitutional revision to engaging in violent activities,
 notably the serious civil disturbance in the city of Inchon in
 May and the prolonged occupation of Konkuk University
 buildings in October. Most were detained for acts of violence
 which, the arrestees argued, were politically motivated.
 Government statistics show that, as of October, 207 persons
 had been charged under or convicted of violating the National
 Security Law for activities considered pro-Communist or anti-
 State, including listening to North Korean radio broadcasts
 and publishing or distributing "subversive" literature. That
 number continued to rise through the end of the year as the
 Government stepped up its campaign against persons and groups
 it charged were violating the National Security Law which
 prohibits activities, including speech, deemed "supportive of
 North Korea."
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Many political and religious dissidents are subjected to
 surveillance by the security forces. During politically
 sensitive periods, this surveillance by one or more security
 agencies may increase, or a form of house arrest may be
 
 
 750
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA,
 imposed. Telephone tapping and opening or interception of
 correspondence is believed to be prevalent. Koreans who meet
 with foreigners, particularly with journalists and foreign
 diplomats, are sometimes questioned afterwards. Listening to
 North Korean radio broadcasts and reading or purveying books
 considered subversive, pro-Communist, or pro-North Korea are
 illegal. Several people were arrested and charged with
 violating the National Security Law for such offenses,
 While the Constitution requires a warrant issued by a judge
 upon request of a prosecutor for search and seizure in a
 residence, the police at times force their way into private
 homes or offices without warrants. The police and security
 force presence in city centers and near university campuses is
 frequently heavy because of fear of antigovernment
 demonstrations. Citizens, particularly students, often are
 stopped, questioned, and searched. Traditional Korean police
 practice requires police commanders to be familiar with the
 personal and business affairs of all residents in their
 jurisdictions. This system is effective in crime control, and
 urban residents generally credit it with keeping their streets
 safe. But the large police presence near college campuses has
 the primary purpose of keeping track of political activities
 and has been a key complaint of students, including those who
 are not politically active.
 In most other respects, the Government honors the right of
 personal privacy and the integrity of the home and family.
 Parental rights to educate children are broad. The State
 rarely seeks to intervene in such inherently personal
 decisions as marriage, choice of vocation, and formation of
 social and familial ties. Persons thought' to have politically
 suspect backgrounds, however, are denied some forms of
 employment-and advancement, particularly in government, press,
 and education. In 1986 the Ministry of Education revised its
 teacher qualification regulations to exclude from obtaining
 teaching positions those who have records of campus activism.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although freedom of speech and press is guaranteed by the
 Constitution, in practice the expression of opposition
 viewpoints is limited, sometimes severely. In 1980 the new
 Chun Government enacted a press law, merged broadcasting
 networks and newspapers, established a government-owned public
 television corporation, and prohibited the stationing of
 reporters by national newspapers in provincial cities.
 Government critics say that statutes such as the basic Press
 Law, under which media organizations are licensed and
 permitted to operate, and criminal code provisions against the
 spreading of "rumors which eventually disturb peace and order"
 and "defiling the State" are used to muzzle and punish
 dissident views. Opposition political parties and several
 major Korean newspaper editorial writers have called for the
 repeal or reform of this basic Press Law. The domestic media
 also engage in "self-censorship," according to guidelines the
 Government regularly gives orally or in writing to editors.
 Journalists who object to or ignore these guidelines or who
 print critical stories on politically sensitive topics have
 been picked up for questioning and on occasion dismissed or
 sent out of the country.
 
 
 751
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 In 1986 such instances included a newspaper cartoonist
 questioned by security investigators in connection with
 editorial cartoons deemed to be insulting to the State and the
 President. Several magazine writers were questioned and, in
 at least one case, dismissed for writing articles on such
 topics as the activities of the security agencies during the
 1970's. On a number of occasions, articles objectionable to
 the Government were withdrawn from later editions and earlier
 editions confiscated.
 Nonetheless, the general trend of greater outspokenness in
 newspapers and magazines continued in 1986, although
 television and radio broadcasting was still rigidly
 controlled. A number of opposition groups, including the
 NKDP, promoted a campaign to boycott the paying of television
 viewer fees on the grounds that the public network was not
 providing unbiased news coverage and was too commercialized.
 Some newspapers joined in the criticism of the public
 television corporation. There were also calls from political
 and religious activists for the restoration of the right of
 the Christian Broadcasting radio station to report other than
 religious news. The Government refused this demand and did
 not revoke the television viewer fee but promised to take into
 account complaints about the station's programing.
 In late 1985 a screening committee was set up with the power
 to ban from sale literature deemed harmful to the public
 including "antisocial or antistate ideology-oriented"
 publications. In 1986 the authorities invoked the National
 Security Law a number of times against persons accused of
 producing, selling, or reading subversive or pro-Communist
 literature. On several occasions police searched bookstores,
 dissident offices, and campuses, seizing banned "leftist"
 books and dissident and student publications carrying material
 objectionable to the Government. Government authorities
 halted the publication of the NKDP's newspaper on at least two
 occasions in 1986.
 Although National Assemblymen enjoy immunity from prosecution
 for remarks made within the Assembly, they are not immune from
 prosecution for what they write or say outside the chamber.
 One opposition Assemblyman was questioned by authorities in
 1986 for distributing a leaflet which "denigrated the State."
 As noted earlier, another, Yoo Sung Hwan, was jailed for
 distributing an advance text of a speech he was to give in the
 Assembly.
 Academic freedom is subject to some political limitations.
 During 1986 over 700 university professors signed various
 statements calling for democratization or constitutional
 revision. Many were subsequently subjected to various
 pressures and punishments including denial of research funds,
 withholding of promotions, demands for written apologies, and
 pressure to resign from administrative positions. Many
 resisted these pressures, with the support of their
 colleagues, and the Government's campaign against them was not
 pressed as far as arrests.
 Professors are expected to play an active role in preventing
 campus demonstrations, a task many find objectionable. Middle
 and high school teachers sometimes are also punished for
 antigovernment political activities. In 1986 there were
 reports of teachers being dismissed, having their pay reduced,
 and receiving undesirable transfers because of having
 participated in antigovernment activities. A civil servant in
 
 
 752
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 the Prime Minister's office reportedly was forced to resign
 after he made a public statement critical of the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 A number of specified categories of assembly, including those
 considered likely to undermine public order or cause social
 unrest, are prohibited by the Law on Assembly and
 Demonstrations. The law also requires that demonstrations of
 all types, including outdoor political assemblies, be reported
 in advance to the police. Violation of the law carries a
 maximum sentence of 7 years' imprisonment or a fine of about
 $3,750. Under this law, police have at times intervened and
 broken up meetings. Most peaceful nonpolitical assemblies
 take place entirely without official supervision or
 restriction. Meetings of dissidents are monitored and
 sometimes prevented, often by placing the scheduled speaker
 under some form of house arrest. In the fall of 1986, the
 Government demanded the "voluntary" disbandment of a dissident
 coalition group; the organization's offices were subsequently
 searched and many of its officials arrested.
 In 1986 the NKDP held a series of rallies in support of
 constitutional revision throughout the country. Police
 permitted a number of events outside the capital region but
 only one (in March) in Seoul. In late spring opposition
 rallies drew crowds of tens of thousands in Pusan and
 Kwangju. But an NKDP rally in Inchon degenerated into
 violence, with the Government blaming radical dissidents and
 the NKDP blaming police for instigating the confrontation.
 Subsequent rallies in the provincial cities of Pusan and
 Kunsan attracted large crowds. Some violence attended these
 events as well, but they were on the whole well-managed. In
 late November, however, the Government used a massive number
 of police to prevent an opposition mass meeting in Seoul.
 The Law on Assembly and Demonstrations was used most often in
 1986 against student demonstrators, with government statistics
 showing 813 persons booked for involvement in campus
 disturbances in the first half of 1986. During the same
 period, 116 persons, including several NKDP and other
 opposition organization figures, were charged with violation
 of the law in connection with the NKDP rallies,.
 Under the Constitution, workers are guaranteed the rights of
 independent association, collective bargaining, and collective
 action. These rights, however, are circumscribed by both
 labor-related laws and practice and do not extend to workers
 employed by the Government, public utilities, defense-related
 industries, or firms that "exercise great influence on the
 national economy."
 The single national labor federation, the Federation of Korean
 Trade Unions (FKTU), and its 16 national affiliate federations
 and unions are not directly controlled by the Government.
 Their activities are, however, limited by law and subject to
 government interference. Labor organizations are precluded by
 law from endorsing a particular political party or politician,
 although the FKTU does lobby National Assemblymen in
 connection with labor and welfare-related legislation.
 According to the FKTU, nationwide dues-paying FKTU membership
 at the end of September was 890,472. Ministry of Labor
 figures, based on reports submitted by individual unions,
 placed total union membership at 1,024,270 at the end of June.
 
 
 753
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 The FKTU is affiliated with the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions, and its constituent federations and unions
 are affiliated with recognized international trade
 secretariats. The Republic of Korea has observer status at
 the ILO and aspires to become a full-fledged member.
 Under existing labor laws, all local unions may be organized
 only up to the level of individual enterprises, creating a
 structure of thousands of shop unions, most of them small and
 weak. Recent amendments to the labor laws removed the FKTU
 and its 16 affiliated national industrial federations from the
 category of "third parties" heretofore enjoined from entering
 into labor disputes. Religious labor organizations such as
 the Catholic Young Christian Workers and the Protestant Urban
 Industrial Mission are severely limited in the assistance
 which they can provide legally established unions.
 Under these circumstances, the influence of the Government and
 employers has greatly exceeded that of unions in setting wages
 and resolving other labor issues. Collective actions and
 strikes, although technically legal, are strongly discouraged
 by the Government and by employers.
 As part of the overall crackdown on dissident activities in
 late 1986, the Minister of Labor in November ordered the
 "voluntary" disbandment of fourteen "leftist-oriented" labor
 organizations, including the Chonggye Garment Workers' Union,
 which the Minister claimed was responsible for many labor
 problems. Government authorities also announced that they had
 uncovered several "clandestine" labor networks that were
 purportedly engaged in attempts to indoctrinate workers with
 leftist ideology. Human rights groups estimated that as many
 as 150 people, including some students, were in prison in late
 1986 because of involvement in various labor-related
 activities. This in part reflects continuing efforts by
 student dissidents to contact and influence labor groups.
 In 1986 the Government continued to use the law on assembly
 and demonstrations to detain workers in connection with labor
 disputes. Despite the legal restrictions and other obstacles,
 collective actions by workers increased in 1986. As of the
 end of October, 249 labor disputes were recorded by the
 Ministry of Labor, compared to 230 during the corresponding
 period in 1985. Most of these disputes were attributed to
 delayed or nonpayment of wages or to worker complaints over
 working conditions. The Government charged that student
 activists had "infiltrated" workplaces, with the intention of
 agitating blue-collar workers, and were responsible for much
 of the reported labor unrest.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state-favored religion in Korea. There is
 generally complete freedom for proselytizing, doctrinal
 teaching, and conversion. Korea both sends and receives
 missionaries of various faiths. Many religious groups in
 Korea maintain active links with coreligionists in other
 countries. The Government and people do not discriminate
 against minority sects. Adherence to a particular faith
 confers neither advantages nor disadvantages in civil,
 military, or official life.
 In 1986 some Buddhist adherents demonstrated against laws
 governing state regulation of temples which they claimed
 constituted discrimination. These protests were put down by
 
 
 754 ..
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 police. Churches and religious groups are subject to many of
 the restrictions on political activities and criticism of the
 Government that apply to all other institutions. On those
 occasions where pastors are harassed by the authorities, it is
 usually for religiously motivated social or political
 activism. Conscientious objectors are subject to arrest.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Except for criminals and persons considered politically
 suspect, most people can obtain passports for travel in the
 officially approved categories such as business. A number of
 dissidents and former political prisoners have been allowed to
 travel abroad, although in 1986 the Government banned foreign
 travel by seven opposition Assemblymen who had been indicted
 for disruptive behavior in the Assembly. In separate
 incidents, several religious dissidents were prevented by
 authorities from attending church conferences abroad at which
 political topics were to be discussed. There is almost
 universal freedom of movement and freedom to change employment
 in Korea. Because Korea is one of the most densely populated
 countries in the world, the Government encourages emigration
 and does not discriminate against prospective emigrants.
 The Government limits the number of passports issued to
 tourists and prospective students, citing foreign exchange
 considerations and the problem of unqualified students going
 abroad. Passports, when issued, are typically limited to 1
 year, although there are exceptions in which passports are
 issued up to the legally maximum 5-year period of validity.
 A small continuing influx of Vietnamese boat people is
 admitted to temporary first asylum in Korea. They are cared
 for at a camp in Pusan by the Korean Red Cross until they can
 be resettled abroad. Over 700 displaced persons from Vietnam
 have passed through Korea in the last several years. Very few
 have been permanently resettled in Korea.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to'Change Their Government.
 Korea's Constitution and statutes as well as its traditions
 concentrate political power in the President, a concentration
 further intensified by the support the President enjoys from
 the military and security agencies. The President and the
 members of the National Assembly are the only elected
 officials in Korea. Under the 1980 Presidential Election Law,
 the President is chosen by a popularly elected electoral
 college of at least 5,000 members. By law, presidential
 campaigns are brief and candidates severely restricted in
 campaigning. There are limits on the amount of money they may
 spend, the number of speeches they may deliver, and the number
 of publications they may distribute. In the 1981 presidential
 election, these restrictions, together with the authorities'
 screening of electoral college candidates, resulted in the
 absence of effective opposition to incumbent President Chun
 Doo Hwan, who won almost unanimously. In the 1985 National
 Assembly election, two of the most prominent opposition
 politicians, Kim Dae Jung and Kim Young Sam, were not allowed
 to participate. That election was, however, fiercely
 contested, and the opposition party scored some stunning
 successes.

 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 The Constitution limits the President to a single 7-year term
 and may not be amended to allow the incumbent President to run
 for another term. President Chun continued to reaffirm that
 he intends to step down in 1988 to provide for a peaceful,
 constitutional transfer of power. Faced with opposition
 demands to amend the Constitution before 1988, Chun agreed to
 revise it if agreement can be reached between political
 parties in the National Assembly. Under present law the
 Constitution can be amended when approved by a two-thirds
 majority in the National Assembly and then affirmed by a
 simple majority of voters in a national referendum.
 The government party proposed instituting a parliamentary
 system with a strong prime minister elected by the National
 Assembly, arguing that such a system would help correct the
 concentration of power in the presidency. The opposition
 continued to push for a direct election presidential system,
 which it said is most compatible with Korea's political,
 culture and the wishes of the people. Both parties expressed
 support for more rapid democratization of Korea including the
 implementation of local autonomy, but at the year's end
 negotiations on constitutional revision were stalemated.
 The National Assembly, although institutionally weak, acquired
 new importance in 1985 with the holding of elections and the
 emergence of a new and more outspoken opposition party, the
 NKDP, formed only weeks before the election and led largely by
 politicians recently freed from the political ban. Members
 are directly elected and serve a 4-year term. The election
 law passed in 1981 provides for a proportional representation
 system that reserves 92 of the assembly's 276 seats for
 members designated by the parties, with two-thirds of these
 seats awarded to the party gaining a plurality of the popular
 vote. The government party, the Democratic Justice Party
 (DJP), garnered a plurality of 35.3 percent in the 1985
 elections and, with its proportional representation seats,
 maintained a comfortable majority of 148 out of 276 assembly
 seats. The NKDP obtained a surprising 29.2 percent of the
 popular vote, and, with the post-election defection to it of
 Assemblymen from other opposition parties, became the largest
 opposition party in the Republic's parliamentary history in
 terms of Assembly seats held. In 1986 the NKDP and other
 oppositionists demanded the revision of the Assembly Election
 Law as well as constitutional revision.
 Political and religious activists involved in opposition
 groups outside the recognized political parties continued to
 come under intense government pressure in 1986. Expressing
 worries about growing leftist trends, the Government
 investigated a number of dissident groups to discern whether
 they included pro-Communists and ordered the "voluntary"
 disbandment of some of them. At the end of the year, a number
 of such dissidents were under investigation or indictment for
 national security law and other violations. The government
 party warned the NKDP against identification with or ties to
 such groups.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Republic of Korea does not belong to any international
 human rights bodies and usually does not welcome outside
 involvement in the human rights area, although government
 officials have allowed the visits of and met with
 
 
 756
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 representatives of international human rights bodies,
 including Amnesty International and Asia Watch.
 According to the Government, public prosecutors and the human
 rights division of the Ministry of Justice are responsible for
 protecting human rights and investigating violations. The
 National Assembly and political parties also have committees
 which are concerned with some aspects of human rights issues.
 The release of political prisoners and allegations of prisoner
 mistreatment were the subject of sharp debate in the National
 Assembly in 1986. The Human Rights committee of the NKDP was
 active in investigating allegations of human rights abuses,
 visiting prisons, meeting with prisoners and their families,
 and providing legal defense in connection with numerous human
 rights issues.
 A number of politically nonaffiliated private organizations
 are active in human rights, chiefly the Human Rights Committee
 of the National Council of Churches of Korea (KNCC), the
 Catholic Justice and Peace Committee, the Korean Bar
 Association, and the Korea Legal Aid Center in Seoul. The
 committees and other human rights organizations submit
 petitions to the Government, publish reports on the human
 rights situation in Korea, and make their views known both
 inside and outside Korea. People working with these groups
 frequently are questioned and sometimes detained by the
 security services. The Chairman of the Catholic Justice and
 Peace Committee was arrested in October for hiding a wanted
 dissident, and the head of the KNCC Human Rights Committee was
 placed on the police wanted list after he signed a statement
 in support of a dissident deemed subversive by the
 Government. In November police armed with a search warrant
 entered the KNCC Human Rights Committee office and seized some
 documents.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Republic of Korea with its 40 million plus population is
 densely inhabited and racially and culturally homogenous.
 There are no ethnic minorities of significant size.
 Despite the cultural homogeneity of its people, regional
 rivalries exist in Korea. Many Koreans believe that persons
 from the southwestern provinces of North and South Cholla face
 some discrimination, and that successive governments led
 predominantly by men from southeast Korea and other areas have
 neglected the economic development of the Cholla provinces.
 The present Government claims that it is making particular
 efforts to encourage the development of the Cholla region.
 In Korea, with its conservative Confucian tradition, women
 remain subordinate to men socially, economically, and
 legally. Some progress has been made. The Family Law was
 revised in 1960 and 1979, but critics contend that the law is
 still inconsistent with Korean constitutional guarantees of
 sexual equality. For example, women do not have equal rights
 with men in passing nationality, nor do they have equal rights
 with regard to child custody in divorce cases. Women's rights
 groups are campaigning for changes in these and other points
 of the Family Law.
 Women are free to vote, become government officials, and run
 for the National Assembly. Women hold seven Assembly seats,
 all but two appointed by their parties. However, the power
 
 
 757
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 structure remains male-dominated, and in many significant
 respects the legal system and social custom strongly
 discriminate against women.
 Women enjoy full access to educational opportunities. They
 are increasingly represented, though still largely at entry
 level, in government and the private sector. As of 1985, only
 24 women had ever passed the bar examination. Only five have
 passed the national administration examination given for
 higher level civil service jobs. In general, women are not
 protected against discrimination in hiring, pay, or
 advancement. They are commonly expected to resign upon
 marriage or pregnancy. Women's organizations and members of
 the National Assembly are trying to focus more attention on
 women's rights.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Chapter V of the Labor Standards Law governs the employment of
 minor and female workers. Under this provision, minors under
 age 13 must have a special permit issued by the Ministry of
 Labor to be employed. Minors under age 18 must have a
 parent's or guardian's written approval in order to work, and
 they are prohibited from night work without special permission
 from the Ministry of Labor. In addition, the law requires
 that employers of 30 or more minors provide educational
 facilities or arrange scholarship funds for them. The
 employment of minors is widespread, particularly in
 labor-intensive industries such as textiles, footwear, and
 small electronics assembly, and abuses of legal protections
 are common.
 The Labor Standards Law provides for a maximum workweek of 60
 hours with the mutual consent of employer and employee, a paid
 day of rest during the workweek, compensation for overtime and
 holiday work, paid holidays, and annual leave. Recent
 statistics indicate that the average full-time industrial
 worker spends close to 55 hours per week on the job. Korea
 has no minimum wage system, but the Government has pledged to
 institute one, possibly as early as 1988, as part of the
 5-year Socioeconomic Plan beginning in 1987. The Government
 also plans to implement an ambitious pension system--still in
 the design stages--which would expand considerably eligibility
 for retirement pension plans by industrial workers.
 In response to recurring criticism of its handling of labor
 disputes, the Government undertook in 1985, and continued in
 1986, to take stronger measures, including fines and
 imprisonment, to curb employer abuses. During the first 9
 months of 1986, 39,111 cases of employer violations of the
 Labor Standards Law were recorded, an increase from 31,419
 during the corresponding period in 1985. Most of the-
 violations involved delayed payment of wages.
 As of August 1986, there were 1,070 job-related deaths and
 92,387 work-related injuries recorded by government sources.
 In 1985, there were 1,718 industrial fatalities and 139,560
 reports of injury. Manufacturing, construction, and mining
 industries continued to be the most hazardous. The Government
 has mandated insurance to cover industrial accidents at places
 of business employing 10 or more workers. The 1981 revision
 of the Industrial Accident Compensation Law covers job-related
 medical costs, sick leave benefits, disability benefits, and
 other costs.
