 BAHRAIN
 The extended family of the Al Khalifa has ruled Bahrain since
 the late 18th century and dominates its society and
 government. The Constitution confirms the Amir as hereditary
 ruler-. The current Amir, Shaikh Isa bin Sulman Al Khalifa,
 governs Bahrain with the assistance of his brother, the Prime
 Minister; his son, the Crown Prince; and an appointed Cabinet
 of Ministers. The Government has suspended some provisions of
 Bahrain's 1973 Constitution, including those articles relating
 to the National Assembly, which the Government disbanded in
 1975. There are few judicial checks on the Amir and his
 Government.
 Bahrain is one of the more heterogeneous societies in the
 Gulf, where social ties and interpersonal associations are
 formed in a complex web of family, tribal, economic, and
 religious affiliations. Bahrain is divided between the Shi'a
 and Sunni sects of Islam, with the Shi'a comprising over
 two-thirds of the indigenous population. There are important
 sectarian divisions among the Shi'a. Despite their minority
 status, the Sunnis predominate because the ruling family,
 supported-by the military, security forces, and powerful
 merchant families, is Sunni.
 The Ministry of Interior is responsible for public security.
 Under its auspices, the police force and the Security and
 Intelligence Service (SIS) are responsible for maintaining
 internal order and preventing sectarian violence and terrorist
 actions. There continue to be persistent credible reports of
 human rights abuses committed by the security forces,
 particularly the SIS.
 Faced with limited oil resources, Bahrain has diversified its
 economic base, attracting companies doing business in
 financial services, petrochemicals, and light manufacturing.
 It has used its oil revenues to build an advanced
 infrastructure in transportation and telecommunications, and
 has become a leading regional financial center. The economy
 benefited from the region's economic boom in the 1970's and
 early 1980's, but suffered from the decline in oil prices
 beginning in 1986. The crisis resulting from Iraq's invasion
 of Kuwait in August 1990 further depressed business
 confidence, resulting in a slowdown in investment and a
 withdrawal of some foreign banks.
 Although some political prisoners were released in 1990, in
 general, civil liberties remain circumscribed. Principal
 human rights concerns continued to include arbitrary
 detentions and credible reports of torture of detainees held
 on security grounds, as well as restrictions on the right to a
 fair public trial, freedom of speech and press, assembly and
 association, women's rights, and worker rights. Citizens do
 not have the right to change their government.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no known political or-other extrajudicial killings.
 
 
 ,1380
 
 BAHRAIN
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although torture is prohibited by law, there continued to be
 credible reports charging the SIS with arbitrary detention,
 mistreatment, and torture. There are no reliable reports
 about what happens during detention in security prisons (where
 questioning may continue after sentencing), since visits by
 nongovernment persons are generally prohibited. The
 Government continues to deny categorically that such practices
 .take place, but to date is has not implemented any of the
 procedural safeguards recommended by international human
 rights groups that would help deter such practices. There
 were no known instances of authorities being punished for
 committing human rights abuses.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention or Exile
 Political activity is strictly controlled by the security
 forces, and persons are detained and arrested for attempting
 to exercise rights of free speech, association, or other
 rights, often on suspicion of antiregime activity. Activities
 that could lead,.under provisions of the security law, to
 detention, questioning, warnings, or arrest include membership
 -in illegal organizations or-those deemed subversive; painting
 antiregime slogans on walls; joining antigovernment
 demonstrations; possessing or circulating antiregime writings;
 preaching sermons with an extreme fundamentalist or a
 'radical" political tone; or harboring or associating with
 persons committing such acts.
 According to the State Security Act of 1974, persons may be
 detained for a-period not to exceed 3 years. Detained persons
 have the right to appeal after a period of 3 months, and, if
 the appeal is denied, thereafter every 6-months from the date
 of the original detention. In the past, the Bahrain
 authorities have detained suspects without charge and have
 held them in incommunicado detention. In its 1990 Report,
 covering 1989, Amnesty International (AI) noted that dozens of
 people had been detained without charge or trial in 1989 and
 that some political detainees had been held in incommunicado
 detention. There are reports that young Bahraini men, without
 the protection of a trial, have been forced to reside outside
 of Bahrain and not allowed to return to Bahrain.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Procedures in Bahrain's Security Court do not meet
 international standards for fair trial. A person arrested may
 be tried in either an ordinary criminal court or, if required
 by the prosecution, the Security Court. Civil trials provide
 procedural guarantees including open trial, the right to
 counsel (with legal aid available when necessary), and the
 right to appeal. Security cases are tried directly by the
 Supreme Court of Appeal, sitting as the Security Court. The
 proceedings are held in secret; there is no right to judicial
 review of the legality of arrests; the Court is exempted from
 adhering to the procedural guarantees of the penal code; and
 there are reports that convictions can be based on confessions
 alone, obtained while in official custody and some-times
 elicited by torture. Bahraini attorneys are appointed by the
 
 
 1881
 BAHRAIN
 Ministry of Justice and Islamic Affairs to act as counsel.
 Sentences imposed by the Security Court may, at the discretion
 of the Court or the desire of the defendant's family, be
 referred to the Amir for clemency.
 The Bahrain Defense Force (BDF) maintains a separate court
 system for military personnel accused of offenses under the
 military code. These courts do not review cases involving
 civilian criminal or security offenses.
 Government officials have stated that there are only 300
 people in Bahraini jails, including those who claim to be
 political prisoners. In its 1990 Report, AI said that over
 100 political prisoners remained in prison, following unfair
 trials.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Interior Ministry may authorize entry into private
 premis6s without judicial authorization. Telephone calls and
 correspondence are subject to monitoring. Police informer
 networks exist.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 While the Constitution provides for the right "to express and
 propagate opinions," in practice Bahrainis cannot freely
 challenge the legitimacy of the regime in speech or writing.
 Political meetings are not permitted; gatherings which might
 take.on a political tone are monitored.
 The Information Ministry exercises wide powers over the local
 media, and the press generally follows official policy
 closely. In the past, minor deviations have brought closure
 of the offending newspapers. The Goverrment also does not
 condone unfavorable coverage of its domestic affairs by the
 international media and does not hesitate to revoke the press
 credentials of offending journalists. In July the Ministry
 threatened to revoke the press credentials of the local office
 director of an international news bureau for refusing to
 inform the Ministry of Information of the names of its
 sources. After many discussions between the parties, the
 Ministry decided to drop the matter. The news agencyand all
 its journalists remain in Bahrain. Since the Ministry also
 sponsors the journalists' residence permits, such actions car
 easily lead to deportation.
 The State owns and operates all radio and television
 stations. Since the spring of 1990, Iran radio and television
 broadcasts (in Arabic and Farsi) have been accessible. Many
 senior government officials, ruling family members, some
 businessmen, and the major hotels may use satellite dishes to
 view international news broadcasts. The use of dishes by
 private citizens to pull in television signals from outside
 Bahrain, including CNN, has greatly multiplied. All
 newspapers are privately owned and exercise self-censorship in
 reporting on antiregime activities and in criticizing the
 Government.

 BAHRAIN
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution affirms the right of free assembly,
 public political demonstrations'or meetings are prohibited.
 Political organizations are also prohibited, but the large
 number of social and sports clubs have traditionally served as
 forums for discreet political discussion. The Government
 monitors the activities of these organizations, which are
 generally small and limited in scope. Permits for religious
 ceremonies, including those for the Shi'a, are routinely
 granted.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The population .is overwhelmingly Muslim, and Islam is the
 state-religion. Christians and other non-Muslims, including
 Jews; Hindus, and Baha'is, enjoy considerable freedom to
 practice their religion. Adherents of other faiths also
 maintain places of worship; some small groups worship in their
 homes. Religious tracts of all Islamic sects, cassettes of
 sermons delivered by famous Muslim preachers from other
 countries, and publications of other religions are readily
 available in Bahrain.
 Proselytizing is not encouraged, and anti-Islamic writings are
 prohibited, but conversions from Islam to other religions are
 tolerated. Both Sunni and Shi'a sects are subject to
 government control and monitoring, but there is no
 interference with routine worship, preaching, or religious
 activities. Public religious events, most notably
 commemorative marches by the Shi'a, are permitted but are
 closely watched by the police. Prior to the Iraqi invasion
 and occupation of Kuwait, there were no restrictions on the
 number of Bahrainis permitted to make pilgrimages to Shi'a
 shrines and holy sites in Iraq. However, religious study in,
 and pilgrimages to, Iran are strongly discouraged.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Bahrainis are free to move within the country and change their
 place of residence or work. Passports though can be denied on
 political grounds. Bahrainis living abroad who are suspected
 of political or criminal offenses may face imprisonment upon
 return to Bahrain. Refugees are not repatriated to countries
 from which they have fled. Generally Bahrain does not accept
 refugees, although it is now home to 7,500 Kuwaiti refugees.
 There are few refugees who arrive in Bahrain. Those that do
 have been allowed to stay while the Middle East representative
 of the United Nations' High. Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
 finds a third country that: would receive them. Bahrain is
 host to the only UNHCR office in the Gulf. There are some
 Iranian emigres who have fled Iran since 1979 and have
 permission to remain in Bahrain, but they have not been
 granted Bahraini citizenship.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right or ability peacefully to change
 their government or their political system. With the 1975
 abolition of the National Assembly, there are no formal
 democratic institutions, and neither political parties nor
 opposition organizations are permitted. Bahrain is ruled by
 the Al Khalifa family, headed by the Ami-r. All government
 
 
 1383
 BAHRAIN
 positions are appointive. About one-third of the cabinet
 ministers are Shi'a, although they do not hold key
 portfolios. The average Bahraini can attempt to influence
 government decisions only through the submission of written
 petitions and informal contact with senior officials,
 including appeals to the Amir at his regular public audiences.
 Four clandestine political groups seek change in Bahrain. The
 Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain, the group
 responsible for the 1981 coup attempt, is almost exclusively
 militant Shi'a in its makeup and calls for violent
 revolution. The Islamic Call Party advocates a relatively
 moderate form of populist Islam and demands reforms in the
 social and economic structure of Bahrain. Both have ties to
 Iran, call for the establishment of an Islamic republic, and
 attract some support from the younger, disaffected Shi'a.
 Public displays of their activism have decreased. Two
 underground, secular leftist groups, the Popular Front for the
 Liberation of Bahrain and the National Front for the
 Liberation of Bahrain, have ties with radical Arab regimes and
 Arab nationalist organizations. Their influence in Bahrain
 has been declining in recent years.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Given the restrictions on freedom of association and
 expression in Bahrain, any independent investigation and
 public criticism of the Government's human rights policies
 would face major obstacles. AI noted in its 1990 Report that
 in May 1989 the Government characterized charges of torture
 and denial of access by families and lawyers to detainees as
 "baseless." It also noted that the Government had not
 responded to AI's detailed recommendations published in
 December 1988 on procedures needed to safeguard human rights.
 No nongovernmental investigations occurred in 1990.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Although there are notable exceptions, Sunni Muslims enjoy a
 more favored status in Bahrain than the Shi'a, who form
 approximately two-thirds of the population. Sunnis receive
 preference for employment in sensitive positions, including in
 the Bahraini Defense Force and the managerial ranks of the
 public sector. Statistics are unavailable, but Shi'a tend to
 be employed in lower paid, lesser skilled jobs. Social and
 municipal services- in most Shi'a neighborhoods, particularly
 in rural villaqes, are markedly inferior to those found in
 Sunni urban communities. In an effort to remedy social
 discrimination, improve living conditions for the Shi'a, and
 encourage sectarian integration, the Government has developed
 subsidized housing complexes open to all Bahrainis on the
 basis of financial need.
 Islamic law (Shari'a) governs the legal rights of Bahraini
 women. Specific rights vary according to Shi'a or Sunni
 interpretations of Islamic law, as determined by the person's
 faith or the court in which various contracts have been
 made--as in the case of marriage, The main complaint by
 women's groups in Bahrain is the inequality of wages and
 opportunity in the workplace. Shi'a women have the right to
 initiate a divorce; Sunni women do not. Women of either sect
 may own and inherit property and may represent their own
 
 
 1384
 
 BAHRAIN
 interests in all public and legal matters. According to
 Islamiq.tradition, a woman generally loses custody of her
 children after they reach the age of 7, but in the case of
 proven incompetdnce on the husband's part, this is not'
 applied. According to national custom, a non-Bahraini woman
 automatically loses custody of her children if she is married
 to, and divorces, a Bahraini man. Women can obtain passports
 without the permission of a male head of the household, and
 may exit the country without permission. Bahraini women have
 the-'freedom to wear the clothing of their choice (a large
 percentage wear Western dress outside the home), to work
 outside the home, and to drive a car without an escort.
 With the development of the Bahrain economy, women have
 increasingly taken jobs previously reserved for men. Women
 now constitute about 18. percent of the Bahraini work force.
 The Government has encouraged the hiring of women, has enacted
 special laws to promote female entry into the work force, and
 is itself a leading employer of women. Generally, women work
 outside the home during the years between secondary school or
 university and marriage. Women make up the majority of
 students at Bahrain's universities.
 There are women's organizations which have as a goal the
 betterment of the status of women under both civil and Islamic
 law.
 Violence against-women is known to occur but is usually kept
 within the family in this traditional'society, and it is
 difficult to judge its extent. In general, there is virtually
 no public attention to or discussion of violence against
 women, and no government policies that focus on it as an
 issue. There are virtually no instances of Bahraini women
 seeking redress for violence in court.
 More evidence exists regarding violence against expatriate
 women working in Bahrain as domestics. Cases of domestics
 beaten badly enough to require hospitalization have been
 reported to the police and in the newspapers. Most victims of
 employer violence fear dismissal and deportation, and
 therefore are unlikely to lodge formal complaints with the
 authorities. Some complaints by employees abused by their
 sponsor have been redressed. There were only two reported
 cases of sexual harassment of expatriate women working in
 Bahrain in 1990. These were settled in the courts.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Although the Constitution recognizes the right of workers to
 organize, there are no trade unions, primarily because the
 Government actively discourages them. Strikes are not
 permitted. In response to labor unrest in the mid-1950's and
 in 1965 and 1974, the Government encouraged--and now closely
 controls--the formation of elected workers' committees in
 major companies. Since 1982, when the Government granted
 permission to form the first joint labor management
 consultative committee (JCC), 12 JCC's have been established
 in the major industries. The JCC's represent close to 70
 percent of the island',s indigenous, industrial labor force.
 Nonindustrial expatriate workers, who comprise about 60
 percent of the overall work force, are denied even these
 limited "rights." The Bahrain Labor Committee, established in
 1983,by law, is a nongovernmental organization that oversees
 
 
 1385
 
 BAHRAIN
 and coordinates the work of the JCC's. THe Committee also
 hears complaints from workers, Bahraini and expatriate alike,
 and assists them in bringing their complaints to the attention
 of the Ministry of Labor or the courts.
 Bahrain has been a member of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) since 1977. In June the ILO's Conference
 Committee on Freedom of Association (CFA) concluded its review
 of a complaint about the arrest and detention since 1986, of
 Mr. Ibrahim Al Kassab, the President of the General Committee
 of Bahrain Workers. Although the CFA was not able to
 determine whether Mr. Al Kassab was imprisoned for trade union
 or political activities, it did conclude that he did not enjoy
 all the guarantees necessary for his defense during a public
 and proper trial and urged his release as soon as possible.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There are no collective bargaining units or contracts. As
 noted above, in 12 key industries employing significant
 numbers of Bahrainis the Government has sanctioned the
 formation of Joint Consultative Committees comprised of
 employee representatives and representatives from management.
 While these JCC's are empowered to resolve labor disputes,
 organize workers' services, and discuss wages, working
 conditions, and raising productivity, the workers have no
 independent, recognized vehicle for addressing these or other
 labor-related issues. There are two export processing zones,
 but labor law and practice is the same in the zones as in the
 rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is legally prohibited and the Labor
 Ministry is charged with enforcing the law. The press reports
 instances in which private sector employers occasionally
 compel expatriate workers from developing nations to perform
 work not specified in their contracts. Once a complaint has
 been lodged by a worker with a grievance, the Labor Ministry
 opens an investigation and often takes appropriate remedial
 action. Many abuses, however, probably go unreported (see
 Section 6.e.).
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment is 16 years. Juveniles between
 the ages of 14 and 16 receive special protection under the
 labor laws. They may not be employed in hazardous conditions
 or at night and may not work over 6 hours per day or on a
 piecework basis. Child- labor laws are enforced by Ministry of
 Labor inspectors.
 e. Acceptable conditions of work
 Bahrain's labor law, enforced by the Ministry of Labor and
 Social Affairs, mandates acceptable conditions of work for all
 adult workers, including adequate standards regarding hours of
 work (maximum 48 hours per week) and occupational safety and
 health. Minimum wage scales, which exist for both private and
 public sector employees, generally afford a decent standard of
 living for a worker and his family. The minimum wage of about
 $265 per month for government employees also applies to
 private sector companies. However, for expatriate workers,
 employers also consider benefits such as annual repatriation,
 housing, and education bonuses as part of the salary.
 
 
 1386
 BAHRAIN
 In -practice, however, expatriate workers are seriously
 disadvantaged by the requirement that all foreigners must be
 sponsored by Bahrainis or Bahrain-based institutions and
 companies in order to work. Under this system, sponsors can
 cancel the residence permit of any person under their
 sponsorship and thereby blacklist them so that they cannot
 obtain entry or residence visas from another sponsor. Such
 power contains the potential for exploitation, since foreign
 workers are often unwilling to report abuses of their rights
 for fear of forced repatriation. Instances of expatriate
 workers being denied their guaranteed holidays, days off, and
 vications without compensation have been reported by the
 English-language daily, which serves as an unofficial
 ombudsman for expatriate workers.
 Bahrain's labor law does not recognize the concept of equal
 pay for equal work. Asian workers are paid lower wages than
 their Bahraini counterparts. Westerners and Bahraini workers
 are paid comparable wages; women are generally paid less than
 men. Women are entitled to 60 days of paid maternity leave
 and nursing periods during the day.
