 MALDIVES
 The Republic of Maldives comprises 1,190 islands scattered across an area 500
 miles long by 75 miles wide in the Indian Ocean. The population is about 245,000
 persons. The Maldives have a parliamentary form of government with a strong exec-
 utive. The president appoints one-sixth of the Parliament, the Cabinet, and mem-
 bers of the judiciary. Political parties are officially discouraged and candidates for
 the unicameral legislature, the Citizens' Majlis, run as individuals. They are elected
 to 5-year terms by universal suffrage. The Majlis selects a single presidential nomi-
 nee who is approved or rejected in a national referendum. The Majlis must a pprove
 all legislation and can enact legislation without presidential approval. Civil law is
 subordinate to Islamic law, but civil law is generally applied in criminal and civil
 cases. The President derives additional influence from his constitutional role as the
 protector of Islam.
 The National Security Service (NSS), which includes the armed forces and police,
 has between 1,500 to 2,000 members who serve in both police and military capac-
 ities during their careers. The police division investigates crimes, collects intel-
 ligence, makes arrests, and enforces house arrest.
 Fishing, small-scale agriculture, and tourism provide employment for over half the
 work force. Tourism accounts for over one-quarter of government revenues and
 roughly 40 percent of foreign exchange receipts. Manufacturing is 6 percent of the
 Gross Domestic Product.
 The Government restricts human rights in several areas, but the political process
 became more open in the past year. Political groupings at odds with the Govern-
 ment emerged in the Majlis which played a more active political role. However, the
 President's power to appoint a significant portion of the Parliament still constrains
 citizens' ability to change their government. An easing of government restrictions
 and creation of a Press Council has allowed a greater diversity of views in the
 media. Nonetheless, important restrictions continued on the freedom of religion.
 Women and workers faced continuing restraints on the full exercise of their rights.
 Some of these restrictions are linked to the Government's observance of Shari'a (Is-
 lamic law) and other Islamic customs.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There were no reports of poitical or
 extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no reports of beatings or other mistreatment of persons in police cus-
 tody. Convicted criminals may be flogged under judicial supervision when this pun-
 ishment is prescribed by Islamic law. However, there were no reported floggings.
 Punishments are usually confined to ines, compensatory payment, house arrest, im-
 
 
 1234
 prisonment, or banishment to a remote atoll. The Government generally permits
 those who are banished to receive visits by family members.
 Prison conditions are adequate. Food and prisoner housing are good by Maldivian
 standards. Prisoners are allowed to work in prison and given opportunity for regular
 exercise and recreation. Spouses are allowed privacy during visits with incarcerated
 partners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution states that "no person
 shall be apprehended, except on a verdict specified by Shari'a or (civil) law."Police
 initiate investigations based on suspicion of criminal activity or in response to writ-
 ten complaints from citizens police officers, or government officials. They are not
 required to obtain warrants for arrests. Based on the results of police investigations,
 the Attorney General refers cases to the appropriate court. The authorities generally
 keep the details of a case confidential until they are confident that the charges will
 be upheld.
 Depending on the charges, a suspect may remain free, detained in prison, or
 under house arrest for 15 days during investigations. The President may extend pre-
 trial detention for an additional 30 days but in most cases the suspect is released
 if not brought to trial within 15 days. hose who are released pending trial may
 not leave a specific atoll. The law, however, permits indefinite detention without
 charge for suspects accused of drug abuse, terrorism, or attempted overthrow of the
 Government. There is no right to legal counsel during police interrogation. There
 is no provision for bail.
 The Government may prohibit access to a telephone and nonfamily visits to those
 under house arrest. While there have been no reported cases of incommunicado de-
 tention in recent years, the law does not provide safeguards against this abuse.
 There were no reports that security officials held citizens for prolonged periods
 without charge. However, 18 Sri Lankan fishing boat captains accused of poaching
 in Maldivian water were held for extended periods-in some cases over 9 months--
 without charge.
 There were no reports of external exile in 1994. However, the Government some-
 times banishes citizens to remote atolls.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-There are eight lesser courts and a High Court
 on the capital island, Male'. The High Court handles a wide range of cases, includ-
 ing politically sensitive ones, and acts as a court of appeal. Each of the lesser courts
 a~udicates specialized cases, such as debt, theft, or property claims. There are also
 general courts on the islands. There are no jury trials. Most trials are public and
 conducted by judges trained in Islamic and civil law.
 Cases on outer islands are usually adudicated by individuals without formal legal
 training, but more complex legal questins are referred to the appropriate special-
 ized court in Male'. The Maledcourt may in turn refer the issue to four dgs at-
 tched to the Justice Ministry.
 During trial, the accused may defend himself, call witnesses, and be assisted by
 a lawyer. Courts do not provide lawyers to indigent defendants. Judges question the
 concerned parties and attempt to establish the facts of a case. They render verdicts
 based on law and custom.
 Civil law is subordinate to Islamic law, or Shari'a. Shari'a is applied in situations
 not covered by civil law as well as in certain acts such as divorce and adultery.
 Courts adjudicating matrimonial and criminal cases generally d not allow legal
 counsel in court because, according to a local interpretation of Shari'a, all answers
 and submissions should come directly from the parties involved. However, the High
 Court allows legal counsel in all cases, including those in which the right to counsel
 was denied in the lower court. Under Islamic practice, the testimony of two women
 is required to equal that of one man.
 The President influences the judiciary through his power to appoint and dismiss
 judges, all of whom serve at his pleasure and are not subject to confirmation by the
 alwye.The President also has authority to affirm judgments of the High Court,
 order a second hearing, or overturn the Court's decision. The President may also
 grant pardons and amnesties.
 Supporters of Ilyas brahim, the President's chief rival for the 1993 presidential
 nomination, who had been detained in late 1993, were brought to trial in early 1994.
 They were charged with involvement in Ibrahim's antistate activities for which he
 was convicted in absentia in 1993. Eight persons were tried, convicted, and sen-
 tenced by early 1994 to 7 years' banishen. th e sentence was reduced to 1 year
 on appeal.
 There are some political prisoners, most of whom were associated with the 1993
 presidential aspirant Ilyas orahim.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondyence.-The
 Constitution prohibits security officials from opening or reading letters, telegrams,
 
 
 1 '       1235
 and wireless messages or monitoring telephone conversations "except in accordance
 with the specific provisions of the law." The NSS may open tle mail of private citi-
 zens and monitor telephone conversations if authoi    in the course of a criminal
 investigation.
 Although the Constitution requires the authorities to respect private premises and
 dwellings, there is no legal requirement for search or arrest warrants. The Attorney
 General or a commanding officer of the police must approve the search of private
 residences.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Pres.-Citizens enjoyed greater freedom of speech and
 expression in 1994. However, Law No. 4J/68 of 1968 still prohibits public statements
 that are contrary to Islam, threaten the public order, or are libelous. In September
 a court sentenced one person to 6 months for making false statements about the
 Government. The Penal Code prohibits inciting the people against the Government.
 However, a 1990 amendment to the Penal Code decriminalized "any true account
 of any act of commission or omission past or present by the Government in a law-
 fully registered newspaper or magazine, so as to reveal dissatisfaction or to effect
 its reform."
 In 1994 the Government established a Press Council, composed of government
 and private media representatives, lawyers, and government officials, which over-
 sees the press and protects the rights of journalists. The Council is drafting a code
 of ethics for journalist activity. The Government is also reviewing regulations that
 made publishers responsible for the content of the material they published.
 In 1994 there were no reports of government censorship of either the print or elec-
 trnic media, nor were there closures of any publications or reports of arrests or in-
 timidation o journalists. The last of the journalists associated With the closed news-
 paper Sangu was released in October 1993 from serving a 3-year sentence under
 house arrest and has resumed writing. The Government reportedly discontinued its
 practice of providing reporting guidelines to the media.
 The range and diversity of viewpoints in the media also expanded in 1994. Tele-
 vision news and public affairs programming routinely discussed topics of current
 concern and freely criticized government performance. Regular press conferences
 were instituted with government ministers.
 The Government owns and operates the only television and radio station. It does
 not interfere with foreign broadcasts or the sale of satellite receiving dishes. Foreign
 newscasts such as the Cable News Network (CNN) are aired on the government tel-
 evision station.
 Seventy-six newspapers and periodicals are registered with the Government
 which publishes 13 of them. Aafathis, a morning daily, is published by the brother
 of the President's principal political rival, flyas Ibrahim, and is often critical of gov-
 ernment policy. An evening daily, Haveer, is published hy one of the President's
 supprters.
 ere are no legal prohibitions on the import of foreign publications, except those
 containing pornography or material otherwise deemed objectionable to Islamic val-
 ues. No seizures of foreign publications were reported in 1994. There are no re-
 ported restrictions on academic freedom, nor any governmental censorship or control
 over classroom materials. Some teachers are reportedly vocal in their criticism of
 the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Article 15 of the Constitution
 provides for the right to assemble, as long as the law or the Islamic code of behavior
 are upheld. The Home Ministry permits public political meetings during electoral
 campaigns but limits them to small gatherings on private premises. The Govern-
 ment registers clubs and other private associations f they do not contravene Islamic
 and civil law. While not forbidden by law, political parties are officially discouraged
 by the President on the grounds that they are inappropriate to the homogeneous
 nature of society. However, there is an active and outspoken opposition group within
 the Majlis that has stimulated closer parliamentary examination of government pol-
 icy.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is significantly restricted. The Con-
 stitution designates Islam as the official religion and requires all citizens to be Mus-
 lims. The practice of any religion other than Islam is prohibited by law. However,
 foreign residents are allowed to practice their religion if they do so privately.
 There are no places of worship for adherents of other religions. The Government
 prohibits the importation of icons and religious statues. It also prohibits non-Muslim
 clergy and missionaries from proselytizing and conducting public worship services.
 Conversion of a Muslim to another faith is a violation of Shari'a law and may result
 
 
 1236
 
 in a loss of the converts citizenship, although law enforcement authorities say this
 provision has never been applied.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Citizens are free to travel at home andabroad, emigrate, and return.
 because of overcrowding, the Government discourages migration into the capital
 island of Male' or its surrounding atoll.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Maldivians' ability to change their Government freely is constrained, as a strong
 executive exerts significant influence over both the legislature and the judiciary.
 The MaJlis chooses a single presidential nominee who must be a Sunni Muslim
 male. The candidate is not permitted to campaign for the nomination and is con-
 firmed or rejected by secret ballot in a nationwide referendum. In 1993 President
 Gayoom was reelected to a fourth 5-year term.
 The elected members of the Majhs serve 5-year terms. All citizens over 21 years
 of age may vote. Of the body's 48 members, 40 are elected-2 from each of the 19
 inhabited atolls and 2 from Male'-and the President appoints 8 members. Individ-
 uals or groups are free to approach members of the Majlis with grievances or opin-
 ions on proposed legislation, and any member may introduce legislation.
 The Office of the President is the most powerful political institution. The Con-
 stitution gives Islamic law preeminence over civil law and designates the President
 as the protector of Islam. The President's authority to appoint one-sixth of the
 Majlis members, which is one-third of the total needed for nominating the Presi-
 dent, provides the President with a power base and strong political leverage.
 Relations between the Government and Majlis have been constructive. The Gov-
 ernment may introduce legislation, but may not enact a bill into law without the
 Majlis' approval. However, the Majlis may enact legislation into law without Presi-
 dential assent if the President fails to act on the proposal within 30 days or if a
 bill is repassed with a two-third majority. In recent years, the Majlis has become
 increasingly independent, rejecting 8 government bills since 1990 and sending 28
 bills to committee for review.
 In 1993 the Majlis introduced a question time in which members may question
 government ministers about public policy. Debate on the floor has since become in-
 creasingly sharp and more open. The last Majlis election was held in December. Ac-
 cording to South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation observers, the elections
 were generally free and fair. Irregularities were observed and repolling required in
 one of 20 constituencies. Over 200 candidates campaigned freely for 40 seats.
 Women are not eligible to become president but may hold other government posts.
 For reasons of tradition and culture, few women seek or are selected for public of-
 fice. In 1994 two women served in the Majlis and one in the Cabinet.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no active local human rights groups. The Government has been respon-
 sive to at least one foreign government's interest in examining human rights issues.
 The Government also facilitated the visit of a team of South Asian Association for
 Regional Cooperation election observers.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Women traditionally have played a subordinate role in society, although
 they now participate in public life in growing numbers and gradually at higher lev-
 els. Well-dcated women maintain that cultural no, not the law, inhibit wom-
 en's education and career choices. In many instances, education for girls is curtailed
 after the seventh grade, largely because parents do not allow girls to leave their
 home island for one having a secondary school. Due largely to orthodox Islamic
 training, there is a strong strain of conservative sentiment--especially among small
 businessmen and residents of the outer islands-which opposes an active role for
 women outside the home.
 Under Islamic practice, husbands may divorce their wives more easily than vice
 versa-absent any mutual agreement to divorce. Islamic law also governs inherit-
 ance, aordin g to male heirs twice the share of female heirs. As noted in Section
 i.e., a woman's testimony is equal to only half of that of a man. Women who work
 for wages generally receive pay equal to that of men in the same positions. About
 10 percent of uniformed NS personnel are women.
 The     re no fu-m data on the extent of violence against women because of the
 value attached to privacy in this conservative society. Police officials report that
 they receive few complaints of assaults against women. Maldivian women's rights
 
 
 1237
 advocates agree that wife beating and other forms of violence are not widespread.
 Rape and other violent crimes against women are rare.
 Children.-There is no reported pattern of abuse against children. Children's
 rights are incorporated into Maldivian law, which specifically protects children from
 both physical and psychological abuse-including at the hang: of teachers or par-
 ents. The Ministry of Home Affairs has the authority to enforce this law, takes its
 responsibility seriously, and has received strong popular supmort for its efforts.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no law that specifically addresses the rights
 of the physically or mentally disabled. However, the Government has established
 programs and provided services for the disabled. There is no legislated or mandated
 accessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-While the Government does not expressly prohibit
 unions, it recognizes neither the right to form them nor the right to strike. There
 were no reports of efforts to either form unions or to strike in 1994.
 The work force consists of approximately 57,000 persons, about 20 percent of
 whom are employed in fishing. About 17,000 foreigners work in Maldives. Many are
 from Sri Lanka and India and work in resort hotels so that Maldivian nationals
 may avoid serving liquor. Many factory workers are also foreign laborers; others are
 engaged in construction projects. The great majority of workers are employed out-
 side the wage sector. The Government estimates that the manufacturing sector em-
 ploys about 15 percent of the labor force and tourism another 10 percent.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law neither prohibits nor
 protects the workers rights to organize and bargain collectively. Wages in the pri-
 vate sector are set by contract between employers and employees and are usually
 based on the rates for similar work in the public sector. There are no laws specifi-
 cally prohibiting antiunion discrimination by employers against union members or
 organizers. The Government has exerted pressure in the past to discourage seamen
 from joining foreign seamen's unions as a means to secure higher wages. There were
 no reported complaints alleging such discrimination in 1994. In addition, there were
 no reports in 1994 of government interference with workers' attempts to join unions.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is not
 prohibited by law. There are no reports that it is practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-There is no compulsory education
 law. A 1992 law bars children under 14 years of age from "places of waged work"
 and from work that is "not suitable for that child's a e, health, or physical ability"
 or that 'might obstruct the education or adversely aflect the mentality or behavior
 ofthe child. An earlier law prohibits government employment of children under the
 age of 16. There are no reports of children being employed in the small industrial
 sector, although children do work in family fishing, agricultural, and commercial ac-
 tivities. The hours of work of young workers are not specifically limited by statute.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In June the Government promulgated its first
 set of regulations for employer-employee relations. The regulations specify the terms
 that must be incorporated into employment contracts and address such issues as
 training, work hours, safety, remuneration, leave, fines, termination, etc. There is
 no national minimum wage for the private sector, although the Government has es-
 tablished wage floors for certain kinds of work. Given the severe shortage of labor,
 employers must offer competitive pay and conditions to attract skilled workers.
 There are no statutory provisions for hours of work, but the new regulations re-
 quire that a work contract specify the normal work and overtime hours on a weekly
 or monthly basis. In the public sector, a 6-hour day and a 6-day workweek have
 been established through administrative circulars from the President's office. Over-
 time pay for working mere than 6 hours a day was instituted in the public sector
 in 1990. Under the new regulations employees are authorized 20 days of annual
 leave, 30 days of medical leave, maternity leave of 45 days, and special annual leave
 of 10 days for extraordinary circumstances. There are no laws governing health and
 safety conditions. Regulations require that employers provide a safe working envi-
 ronment and ensure the observance of safety measures.
