 CAMBODIA
 The year 1991 was marked by major political changes in
 Cambodia. The four warring factions finally signed a
 Comprehensive Settlement Agreement in Paris in October calling
 on the United Nations to supervise the cease-fire, cantonment,
 and demobilization of forces, and to prepare for and conduct
 free and fair elections in Cambodia. In November the U.N.
 Advance Mission was deployed, and Prince Sihanouk returned to
 set up the Supreme National Council in Phnom Penh. Meanwhile,
 the Phnom Penh regime endorsed multiparty and free market
 policies in an Extraordinary Party Congress called in advance
 of the Paris Conference. Before the year ended, Cambodians had
 begun speaking out and expressing some of their frustrations in
 a number of anti-Khmer Rouge and anticorruption demonstrations:
 This'report thus attempts to describe human rights conditions
 in Cambodia as they have changed over the course of the year.
 The regime in Phnom Penh has called itself the State of
 Cambodia (SOC since 1989, but it is still frequently referred
 to by its former name, the People's Republic of Kampuchea
 (PRK). Headed by Party Chairman and National Assembly
 President Chea Sim, Council of Ministers Chairman Hun Sen, and
 Honorary Party Chairman and Council-of State'Chairman Heng
 Samrin, the regime was installed by the Vietnamese army which
 drove the Communist Khmer Rouge from Phnom Penh in 1979.
 Although Vietnam withdrew most of its forces from Cambodia in
 1989, Hanoi continues to exert some influence over the Phnom
 Penh regime's policies.
 Between 1975 and 1979, when the Khmer Rouge held power in
 Cambodia, it compiled one of the worst records of human rights
 violations in history as a result of a thorough-and brutal
 attempt at restructuring Cambodian society. More than 1
 million people, out of a total population of 7 million, were
 killed or died under the Khmer Rouge's murderous reign.
 The current Phnom Penh regime, although controlling most of the
 territory of Cambodia, is not recognized by the majority of the
 international community. In fact, with the postsettlement
 establishment in Phnom Penh of the Cambodian Supreme National
 Council (SNC) under Prince Sihanouk, those governments which
 had recognized the Hun Sen regime have generally switched their
 accreditation to the SNC. Under the 1989 Phnom Penh regime's
 Constitution, power is wielded by the Communist Kampuchean
 People's Revolutionary Party (KPRP) as the "sole leader of the
 entire Cambodian society." The KPRP held an Extraordinary
 National Congress in October to prepare for participation in
 the postsettlement elections. It changed its name to the
 Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and endorsed a free market and
 multiparty system.
 Prior to the signing of the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement
 on October 23, the KPRP's control over Cambodia was challenged
 by the National Government of Cambodia (NGC), formerly known as
 the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK). This
 resistance coalition was composed of the Communist Khmer Rouge
 and two factions making up the non-Communist resistance (NCR).
 The first NCR faction is the National United Front for an
 Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia
 (FUNCINPEC), whose leader is now Prince Ranariddh, son of
 Prince Sihanouk. FUNCINPEC's military force is. the National
 Army of Independent Cambodia (ANKI). The second is the Khmer
 People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) led by former Prime
 Minister Son Sann. The KPNLF armed forces are commanded by
 General Sak Sutsakhan and operate independently of the KPNLF

 political leadership. The forces of the three resistance
 groups had each been waging war against the Phnom Penh regime
 from enclaves in western and northern Cambodia and areas along
 the Thai-Cambodian border. A voluntary cease-fire has been in
 place since May, however, and the coalition has effectively
 been dissolved since the settlement in October.
 As part of international efforts to negotiate a settlement
 ending the conflict, the four Cambodian factions--including the
 Phnom Penh regime--established the SNC, which is to represent
 Cambodia during the transitional period before the formation of
 a new and legitimate government. According to the settlement,
 the U.N. Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) is to
 organize, conduct, and supervise free and fair elections which
 are now expected in the spring of 1993. UNTAC will also
 monitor and supervise the cease-fire, withdrawal of foreign
 forces, and cantonment and demobilization of factional forces.
 Prince Sihanouk returned on November 14 to set up the SNC in
 Phnom Penh, and the U.N. Advance Mission in Cambodia (UNAMIC)
 is now in Cambodia preparing for the deployment of UNTAC. U.S.
 diplomats opened the U.S. Mission in Phnom Penh on November 11.
 In light of Cambodia's tragic recent history, the settlement
 agreement noted the need for special measures to. assure
 protection of human rights, charged UNTAC with guaranteeing
 oversight of human rights, and proposed that the U.N. Human
 Rights Commission [UNHRC] closely monitor human rights in
 Cambodia.
 Cambodia's economic system continued its transition to a market
 economy in 1991, Despite continued growth of the private
 sector, which led to a marginal increase in the living
 standaras of Cambodians, the country again experienced severe
 shortages of goods. Agricultural production was below normal
 due to severe flooding and lack of farm equipment and draft
 animals. Widespread corruption by officials of the Phnom Penh'
 regime continued to exacerbate economic problems, as did the
 elimination of assistance from Eastern European countries and
 the Soviet Union.
 As in previous years, accurate information on the Phnom Penh
 regime's human rights record is scarce. Travelers to Cambodia
 and Cambodians who have left the country indicate that human
 rights violations--including the absence of due process; the
 continued imprisonment of large numbers of political prisoners;
 restrictions on freedom of speech, press, assembly and
 association, and religion; and an almost complete lack of
 worker rights--continued to occur in sections of'the country
 under the control of the Phnom Penh regime, despite recent
 evidence of substantial improvements. As in previous years, it
 has been easier to obtain information on the NCR's human rights
 practices than on either the Phnom Penh regime or the Khmer
 Rouge.
 Serious human rights violations by the Khmer Rouge, including
 attacks on civilians and communications, disappearances, and
 curbs on freedom of religion and other personal freedoms,
 continued to be reported during 1991, although there were fewer
 reports of egregious abuses. There were reports of Khmer Rouge
 distributions of food, clothing and other forms of assistance
 within Cambodia in an attempt to win the loyalty of, the rural
 population in particular. The Khmer Rouge top leadership from
 1975-79 remains in place however, (albeit behind the scenes),
 and there continue to be-reliable  reports that these leaders
 retain their ultimate goal of regaining power in Cambodia.
 
 
 800
 CAMBODIA
 There were credible reports of human rights abuses by members
 of both non-Communist groups during 1991. As in previous
 years, lack of discipline in the KPNLF ranks resulted in acts
 of banditry against some Thai villagers and Cambodians in the
 border area and inside Cambodia. Some ANKI and KPNLF troops
 were responsible for acts of violence against civilians living
 in the non-Communist displaced persons camps in Thailand at
 Site B and Site 2. An increase in the seriousness and violence
 of such incidents on the part of NCR troops idled since the
 cease-fire was reported in 1991. Respect for human rights by
 residents of displaced persons camps of all three resistance
 factions continued to improve, however, due largely to U.N.
 training of Khmer police, the presence of U.N. security liaison
 officers, and the expansion 6f the justice and.court systems,
 programs begun under U.N. auspices in 1989. The camp
 administration opened a prison under the supervision of the
 United Nations at Site 2.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 While there have been reports of political killing by the Phnom
 Penh regime in recent years, there were no such reports in
 either 1990 or 1991.
 Although there were no reports of political killings by the
 Khmer Rouge during 1991, a credible report in May stated that
 the Khmer Rouge executed 30 persons in July 1990 for advocating
 greater personal, economic, religious, and travel freedoms.
 Despite the Khmer Rouge effort to improve its image and obtain
 popular support in advance of the elections, civilians
 continued to be killed during attacks by the Khmer Rouge on
 towns, trains, and lines of communication during the first few
 months of the year prior to the commencement of an informal
 cease-fire in May.
 The non-Communist factions were not directly accused of
 extrajudicial killings during 1991. However, in June the
 bodies of nine persons were discovered north of Site 2. The
 media reported that the persons were executed as part of a
 factional struggle within the KPNLF. Other sources have
 indicated that those executed were bandits. There have been
 other unconfirmed reports that the KPNLF and ANKI have
 summarily executed alleged bandits.
 b. Disappearance
 Reports of disappearances in Cambodia continued during 1991.
 As in previous years, many of these cases involved conscription
 into the Phnom Penh armed forces. Khmer Rouge defectors
 reported that Khmer Rouge soldiers, rather than killing Phnom
 Penh regime and village officials, often abducted them for
 "reeducation." Defectors from the Khmer-controlled Pailin area
 also reported that the Khmer Rouge sometimes abducted gem
 miners, forcing them to serve as porters for Khmer Rouge
 units. The Khmer Rouge abducted three persons from the O'Trau
 refugee camp in Thailand in 1991. They later were seen by U.N.
 border relief workers imprisoned in another Khmer Rouge camp.
 Residents of the camp reported that the three were accused of
 selling guns and artifacts.
 
 
 801
 CAMBODIA
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Article 35 of the 1989 Phnom Penh Constitution specifically
 prohibits the use of coercion or physical abuse against
 prisoners. In past years, physical torture by regime
 authorities had been reported both in rural areas and in Phnom
 Penh at facilities under the control of both the Ministry of
 Interior (and its subordinate civil police forces) and the
 armed forces. Beginning in 1989, however, a few prisoners who
 escaped or were released from regime prisons reported that the
 regime had reduced its use of torture. Reports of torture
 persisted in 1990, but there were no such incidents-reported in
 1991.
 There were unconfirmed reports-of KPNLF mistreatment of
 Vietnamese prisoners held inside Cambodia. Most former Phnom
 Penh regime prisoners, whether political or criminal, report
 being beaten at some stage during their confinement. In
 previous years, some detainees reported being held
 incommunicado in small and completely dark solitary confinement
 cells that were poorly ventilated and unsanitary. They were
 constantly immobilized by shackles on both legs and were
 sometimes handcuffed. Former prisoners reported that prison
 officials often withheld food, water, and medical attention
 from detainees during their interrogations. While there were
 no specific reports in 1991, there is no evidence that this
 practice has changed. There are no known cases of any
 officials being prosecuted by the Phnom Penh regime for torture
 or other mistreatment of prisoners. Reports of conditions
 inside regime prisons are sparse. The Interior Ministry
 refused Asia Watch's request to visit two prisons in Phnom Penh
 to speak confidentially eo prisoners about conditions. Despite
 a request dating from 1981 for access to the regime's prisons,
 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has not yet
 been permitted access. The U.S. Mission in Phnom Penh
 reported, however, that senior regime officials have recently
 promised the ICRC access to prisons.
 There were significant improvements in the conditions of jails
 run by the United Nations in the displaced persons camps in
 Thailand. This was due primarily to training and monitoring of
 prison wardens by the United Nations as part of the institution
 of a legal justice system and the construction of a prison at
 Site 2. There were reliable reports, however, that at
 locations outside these camps soldiers from the ANKI and KPNLF
 continue to beat people suspected of spying for Phnom Penh.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Phnom Penh Constitution forbids unlawful "accusation,
 arrest, detention, or imprisonment." However, the virtual
 absence of legal process under the Phnom Penh regime remains.
 There are reliable reports that the regime is trying to
 establish at least the structure of a legal system, but a
 severe lack of trained personnel has crippled the attempt.
 Regime authorities often detain, interrogate, and jail common
 criminals and resistance sympathizers for extended periods
 without formal charges. This seems to be the rule rather than
 the exception. In September Phnom Penh regime Foreign Minister
 Hor Namhong announced that political prisoners will be released
 once a settlement agreement is signed, and the regime
 subsequently announced that 442 political prisoners were
 released in October. It has been-corroborated that at least
 some regime officials arrested in 1990 for espousing democratic
 
 
 802
 CAMBODIA
 ideas were indeed released. In December members of Amnesty
 International were received by Prince Sihanouk in Phnom Penh
 and permitted to visit prison offices in the country.
 A major obstacle to reducing the arbitrariness of the Phnom
 Penh legal system is the role of the Interior Ministry.
 According to one reliable report, the Interior Ministry remains
 a law unto itself without check by other branches of the
 regime. Among its other extrajudicial powers, the Interior
 Ministry has authority to overturn all court rulings and
 controls the regime's prison system.
 In each displaced persons camp in Thailand, the United Nations.
 has worked closely with Khmer administrators to implement a
 judicial system, incorporating both traditional Khmer and
 Western legal procedures and codes. Under this system, a
 judicial committee presides over trials open to the public, and
 the accused has the right to address the court and the right to
 legal counsel. In late 1991 the United Nations initiated a
 program to inform the Khmer camp populations of their basic
 human rights.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The 1989 Phnom Penh Constitution recognizes the presumption of
 innocence and provides for a lawyer at every trial, if the
 defendant requests one. It also provides for open trials but
 permits secret trials if provided for by law.
 In past years, political prisoners held by the Phnom Penh
 regime were regularly denied fair trials. The situation does
 not appear to have changed. Former prisoners reported in 1990
 that the role of the regime's court system appeared to be
 limited to determining a suspect's sentence, not deciding
 whether the suspect was innocent or guilty. The regime has
 used trials for propaganda and public intimidation. There are
 few procedural rights for defendants. Defendants have been
 required to memorize carefully and rehearse in advance all the
 questions and answers to be presented in court, even in cases
 where the interrogators have already.decided to release them;
 if these defendants satisfactorily recited their testimony as
 rehearsed, they were released. Other reports indicated that
 prisoners who had been arrested by regime authorities for
 alleged cooperation with the resistance were incarcerated, not
 as a result of judicial proceedings, but rather because they
 confessed to their crimes under interrogation.
 Recently released political prisoners estimate that there are
 between 1,000 and 2,000 political prisoners held by the regime,
 none of whom received fair trials. (Note: This was before the
 announcement of the release of 442 political prisoners in
 October.) Regulations of the regime provide for the arrest and
 1reeducation" of "any person carrying out propaganda campaigns
 to sabotage internal unity and Kampuchea-Laos-Vietnam
 solidarity." Such "reeducation" means indefinite detention to
 force a change in political values. Cambodians who left the
 country in 1991 reported that the regime still operates
 reeducation centers for political prisoners in various parts of
 the country. Imprisonment as a form of extortion is also
 reportedly practiced.
 
 
 803
 CAMBODIA
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Phnom Penh regime authorities search whenever and wherever they
 wish and maintain extensive surveillance operations.
 Cambodians who departed the country in 1991 reported that the
 regime continues to maintain networks of informers who report
 to the secret police. Visitors to Cambodia reported that
 regime militia and soldiers regularly extort money from
 travelers along the roads. The Phnom Penh regime also opens
 and censors mail. In addition, since July 1990, the regime has
 required that Cambodians wishing to marry foreigners or
 overseas Khmer must obtain permission from the regime's Council
 of Ministers.
 The Khmer Rouge continued to regulate strictly the social
 activity of those under its control: Khmer Rouge defectors
 reported that the Khmer Rouge still strongly discourages its
 members and civilians under its control from marrying freely.
 Those who do not obtain permission before marriage can be
 punished. Many Khmer Rouge defectors, however, reported i
 relaxation of some restrictions in 1991. For example, Khmer
 Rouge civilians who moved into Cambodia in 1991 reported that
 obtaining permission to seek medical treatment in a
 U.N.-assisted camp in Thailand is relatively easy. Although
 the Khmer Rouge became more relaxed about contacts between its
 populations and foreigners, visitors to Site K note that camp
 leaders there still seem reluctant to allow foreigners private
 access to camp residents.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 Until the cease-fire took effect in May, troops from all
 factions, but especially those from the Phnom Penh forces,
 shelled targets indiscriminately, causing civilian casualties.
 There were frequent incidents of banditry along the border by
 NCR troops against Thai and Cambodian residents, some of whom
 died in these attacks. In an-August attack on Site 2, between
 60 and 70 bandits killed 9 persons. In September Thai troops
 -reacting to a bandit attack on Site 2 fired a mortar round into
 the camp, killing 1 person and wounding 10. In addition, all
 factions have indiscriminately laid millions of mines
 throughout Cambodia.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is severely restricted. The press
 and radio in Cambodia are wholly controlled by the Phnom Penh
 regime. The regime reserves the right to deny publication of
 material that does not "express reality properly." Criticism
 of the regime is not generally tolerated, though some persons
 have reported seeing in Phnom Penh underground leaflets
 critical of the regime. In May 1990, dozens of regime
 officials were reportedly arrested for attempting to publish a
 manifesto of a nascent opposition party. Some of these have
 since reportedly been released (see Section l.d.). The editor
 of the leading newspaper was removed from his position,
 apparently for his association with this group. Possession of
 foreign books and periodicals can result in arrest, but it is
 doubtful that such regulations are strictly enforced.
 
 
 804
 CAMBODIA
 In some parts of the country, people who repeatedly listen to
 foreign radio broadcasts after being warned not to do so are
 detained without charge for a day or two. In other areas,
 however, people may listen to the radio freely. The Phnom Penh
 regime attempts to control what types of movies the population
 sees, but widespread smuggling of video tapes has made movie
 censorship virtually impossible. During 1990 the regime denied
 visas to several foreign reporters and asked another to leave
 the country, apparently because they had written articles
 critical of the regime. Similarly, in 1991 a foreign
 journalist was expelled, reportedly also for writing articles
 critical of the regime.
 Freedom of speech in camps and areas controlled by the
 residtance varies considerably. In Site 2, residents often
 speak their minds freely. However, credible sources report
 that residents of Sok Sann (KPNLF) and Site B (FUNCINPEC) have
 little freedom to criticize their leaders. Residents of
 U.N.-assisted camps, including those run by the Khmer Rouge,
 have access to a wide range of foreign publications. They also
 may listen to the radio or watch television freely. Unlike in
 past years, Khmer Rouge defectors reported in 1991 that
 residents of most of these camps may now listen to foreign
 radio and Thai television broadcasts.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The only associations permitted by the Phnom Penh regime are
 those created to support the regime, such as those for farmers,
 women, and youth. These are usually headed by ranking party or
 regime officials. Since the settlement, however, there were
 public demonstrations in Phnom Penh against corruption which
 have in fact resulted in the dismissal of certain high-level
 officials.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Article 6 of the 1989 Phnom Penh Constitution makes Buddhism
 the state religion of Cambodia. The regime also announced in
 May 1989 that all men were free to enter the monkhood, provided
 the ordination was approved by the regime and carried out by
 designated senior monks. However, the Buddhist hierarchy is
 controlled by the Phnom Penh authorities, and the curriculum of
 temple schools is set by the Ministry of Education, which also
 provides the teachers. Cambodians who left the country in 1991
 indicate that, in most parts of the country, there has been a
 pronounced relaxation of the regime's restrictions on religious
 activity and there is now considerable freedom to practice
 Buddhism and enter the monkhood. The regime authorities still
 attempt to use the Buddhist hierarchy as one of-a number of
 organizations for "mass mobilization" to implement party
 policies. Increasingly in 1991, the regime media widely
 publicized the appearances by senior Phnom Penh leaders at
 Buddhist ceremonies, which they often used to make political
 ,speeches. The Phnom Penh regime allows Protestant and Roman
 ,-Catholic'communities-in Phnom Penh to meet and hold services.
 In January a Catholic church opened in Phnom Penh, reportedly
 staffed by three foreign priests. Four Cambodian nuns have
 also returned to Cambodia. Muslims continue to be able to
 practice their religion. The October National Congress, while
 recognizing Buddhism as the state religion, provided for
 guarantees of religious freedom.
 When in power in Phnom Penh, the Khmer Rouge actively sought to
 exterminate religion. However, as part of its "united front"
 
 
 805
 CAMBODIA
 campaign, the Khmer Rouge now permits the construction of
 temples in its camps and permits men to become monks.
 Christianity and Islam were ruthlessly suppressed by the Khmer
 Rouge when they controlled Cambodia and are not known to have
 been revived in Khmer Rouge-controlled areas. Residents of all
 camps affiliated with the non-Communist factions are free to
 practice any religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Phnom Penh regime has eased controls on travel within
 Cambodia, and travel has become easier despite regime attempts
 to maintain systems of neighborhood surveillance, family,
 registration, and identification documents. The Interior
 Ministry has issued identity cards which permit Cambodians
 holding them to travel within the country without a travel
 pass. Recent arrivals in Thailand from Cambodia report that
 traders and other Cambodians can, either through bribing
 officials at checkpoints or avoiding the checkpoints entirely,
 move around the country freely.
 Permission is required to travel abroad. Those traveling on
 official business, including training programs abroad, have
 little difficulty obtaining exit visas. However, those without
 official reasons for travel have difficulty obtaining
 permission and often must pay bribes, reportedly between $500
 and $2,000 per person. Other Khmer seeking to leave the
 country flee to the Thai border either to escape the conflict
 or in the hope they can enter U.N.-supported refugee camps in
 Thailand. Mines and bandits are endemic dangers in the border
 areas and, increasingly, within Cambodia. Regime and
 resistance soldiers often extort money from those fleeing
 Cambodia before permitting them to cross into Thailand.
 Most of the several hundred thousand Cambodian refugees who
 fled to Thailand before 1980 have been approved for
 resettlement and have departed for Western countries. However,
 13,000 Cambodians accorded refugee status but rejected for'
 resettlement by third countries--generally because of close
 . contacts with the Khmer Rouge regime before 1979--remain at the
 Khao-I-Dang holding center in Thailand.
 .An additional 350,000 Cambodians--generally those who have fled
 since 1980-are in other camps on the Thai-Cambodian boeder.
 They have not been accorded legal refugee status and are'
 considered "displaced persons" who will eventually return home
 when security conditions permit. They are generally not
 eligible for resettlement in third countries. The Phnom Penh
 regime has agreed in principle to accept returning displaced
 persons from camps in Thailand. It is also obliged under the
 settlement agreement to honor the freedom of these displaced
 persons to settle anywhere and to move about freely in
 Cambodia. During 1991, 16 displaced persons were voluntarily
 repatriated from Thailand.
 In past years, some villages close to the Thai-Cambodian
 border, especially those near known infiltration pointi, were
 relocated by the Phnom Penh regime. During 1990 the regime
 also relocated several thousand persons living far from the
 border in Kompong Speu, moving them away from areas under the
 influence of the Khmer Rouge. Recent reports indicate that
 these villagers were moved to protect them from the fighting.
 These persons remained displaced during 1991, although there
 were no reports of additional displacement of villagers in
 
 
 806
 CAMBODIA
 1991. As many as 174,000 people within Cambodia had been moved
 by the regime to relocation camps or had fled there because of
 increased military activity. Cambodian refugees reported that
 conditions in relocation camps *ere often primitive, without
 clean water or sanitation.
 Residents of the KPNLF's Site 2 and Sok Sann camps often
 crossed the border to and from Cambodia during 1991. Residents
 of the three U.N.-assisted Khmer Rouge camps were able to
 depart their camps to farm (Site 8 and Au Trao) or to mine for
 gems (Site K). Many former Khmer Rouge camp residents now in
 Cambodia frequently visit relatives in U.N.-assisted camps in
 Thailand, but they report that not all people under Khmer Rouge
 control are permitted to do so.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Cambodian people do not enjoy the right to change their
 government through democratic means. The Kampuchean People's
 Revolutionary Party (KPRP), now the Cambodian People's Party,
 controls political life in the areas of the country governed by
 the Vietnamese-installed Phnom Penh regime and allows no
 competitors.
 The only national election in the area controlled by the Phnom
 Penh regime in 1981 did not allow genuine political
 participation, but rather was staged by the regime to attempt
 to demonstrate legitimacy. The regime's party was the only one
 allowed to field candidates. Although National Assembly
 members were supposed to serve terms of 4 years, no election
 has been held since the original election. The regime
 announced in 1989 that an election would take place before the
 end of the year, but none was held. The October National
 Congress endorsed liberal democracy and a multiparty system, as
 well as the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.
 An integral part of the Cambodian settlement agreement is the
 staging of "free and fair elections." With the signing of a
 comprehensive settlement agreement on Cambodia, the way was
 opened for the first genuinely free elections since the
 1950's. If held as planned, they will permit Cambodians to
 choose their own representatives and lead to a freer, more
 democratic society. On October 31, however, officials
 prevented a Cambodian-American from announcing plans to create
 a new political party in Phnom Penh.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Independent local human rights groups do not exist.
 Human rights violations in Cambodia have been the subject of
 intense, international attention since 1978, when the UNHRC and
 its Subcommission on the Prevention of Discrimination and
 Protection of Minorities began investigating the Khmer Rouge
 record of atrocities.
 In previous years the Phnom Penh regime refused to allow
 investigations of alleged human rights abuses, though the
 regime did permit a brief visit to Cambodia in August 1989 by
 the Cambodia Documentation Commission. In 1990 the regime
 allowed Asia Watch to'study some aspects of the human rights
 situation in Cambodia, although the regime refused its requests
 
 
 807
 CAMBODIA
 to visit prisoners. The ICRC has been unable to visit
 political prisoners, despite an agreement in principle, because
 of the Phnom Penh regime's insistence on limiting visits to
 only a few of the regime's prisons. Phnom Penh informed U.S.
 diplomats in December, however, that they are about to permit
 ICRC prison visits. The regime has local Red Cross
 organizations, but neither they nor any other groups within
 regime-controlled areas have a role in the protection of human
 rights.
 The monitoring of human rights conditions required by the
 comprehensive settlement should substantially improve the
 ability of international human rights organizations to
 investigate the human rights situation and may lead to
 conditions in which local human rights groups might function.
 All U.N.-assisted camps affiliated with the resistance allow
 education in human rights issues as well as investigations of
 human rights complaints. The Khmer Rouge do not permit
 investigations of human rights issues in areas under their
 control, except in U.N.-assisted camps.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Directives issued by the Phnorm Penh regime in 1982 seemed to
 accord a privileged status to Vietnamese immigrants as compared
 .with Cambodian residents, and there were many reports over the
 years of Vietnamese taking advantage of their privileged status
 ta force Cambodians from desirable jobs or land. However, with
 the announced departure of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia in
 1989, some Vietnamese merchants and settlers left Cambodia for
 Vietnam. Travelers returning from Cambodia see little
 indication that those Vietnamese who stayed have maintained
 their privileged status. With the virtually complete
 withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, there have so-far been no
 reports of Cambodian reprisals against Vietnamese civilians.
 The resistance repeatedly claimed in 1990 that there are more
 than 1 million Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia, but there is no
 independent, Verified information on the number of Vietnamese
 settlers in Cambodia. The resistance has dropped its demand
 that all Vietnamese settlers must depart the country before a
 peace settlement can be reached.
 There is no specific information available on discrimination of
 other types, including violence against women, although
 international relief workers in the border camps have noted
 that there appears to be significant physical abuse against
 women and children in some of the camps.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers in Cambodia do not enjoy the right of. association.
 Organized labor is totally under the Phnom Penh regime's
 control, and industries have organized branches of the
 "Kampuchean Federation of Trade Unions" (KFTU), which is an
 official mass organization headed by a member of the CPP's
 standing committee. As far as can be determined, there is no
 right to strike.
 
 
 808
 CAMBODIA
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no right to collective bargaining in Cambodia. Wage
 .scales for the few industrial and regime workers are set by
 Phnom Penh. The KFTU claims to have successfully demanded pay
 increases and subsidies on nine basic commodities in 1983 from
 the Phnom Penh regime. The regime has not. established any
 economic incentive zones, although the October National
 Congress called for a free market economy and free trade.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Although Cambodia his ratified International Labor Organization
 Convention 29 on the abolition of forced labor, such practice
 by the Phnom Penh regime is common, although not primarily as a
 sanction or means of racial, social, or other discrimination.
 Although the use of forced labor has appeared to decrease in
 recent years, the regime still conscripted thousands of
 laborers to clear brush, cut timber, and build roads.
 *The decrease in the number of forced laborers since early 1989
 was partly the result of the institution of a nationwide
 military draft, which led to the forcible seizure of young men
 from their farms, schools, and movie and video halls and their
 transfer directly to the front, with minimal or no training.
 This mass conscription policy resulted in many of those drafted
 fleeing to Thailand.
 The Khmer .Rouge also requires labor from all persons under its
 control, including women, children, and the handicapped.
 Defectors continued to report in 1991 that Khmer Rouge leaders
 forced some people to carry supplies and ammunition into the
 interior of Cambodia in support of military operations, though
 these defectors insisted that most porters worked voluntarily.
 However, the increasing use of trucks for transport and the
 lessened logistics demand since the cease-fire commenced in May
 reduced the Khmer Rouge's need for porters in 1991. There were
 no reports during 1991 that the ANKI or KPNLF used forced labor
 to carry supplies for their troops.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Phnom Penh regime has no known minimum age for the
 employment of children. Children are regularly employed as
 soon as they are physically able to perform the tasks required,
 either in agriculture or industry. In past years, the
 resistance forces have been reported to employ children as
 porters.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 No attention appears to have been given by Phnom Penh
 authorities to ensuring acceptable conditions of work, and
 there is little information on this subject. The wage scales
 set by the regime are universally regarded as insufficient,
 forcing'employees to supplement their wages through part-time
 jobs or other means.
