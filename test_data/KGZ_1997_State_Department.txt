 KYRGYZ REPUBLIC
 The Kyrgyz Republic became an independent state in 1991. Although the 1993
 Constitution defines the form of government as a democratic republic with substan-
 tial civil rights for its citizens, the President, Askar Akayev, dominates the govern-
 ment. Akayev was reelected in December 1995 in an open, multicandidate presi-
 dential election, which was marred, however, by deregistration of three rival can-
 didates immediately prior to the vote. Also in 1995, a new, two-chamber Parliament
 was elected for a 5-year term. The Constitution was amended by referendum in Feb-
 ruary 1996 to strengthen substantially the presidency and define the role of Par-
 liament. However, the referendum was marred by serious irregularities. In 1995 a
 Constitutional Court was sworn in, and a reform program was implemented to im-
 prove the quality of the judiciary in 1996. While Parliament has become increas-
 ingly active, the balance of power resides in the office of the President. The judiciary
 is dominated by the executive branch.
 Law enforcement responsibilities are divided between the Ministry of Internal Af-
 fairs (MVD) for general crime, the Ministry of National Security (MNB) for state-
 level crime, and the procurator's office for both types of crime. Both the MVD and
 the MNB deal with corruption and organized crime. These ministries inherited their
 personnel and infrastructure from their Soviet predecessors. Both appear to be
 under the full control of the Government and usually conform their actions to the
 law. Kyrgyzstani borders are manned by Russian border troops under an agreement
 with the Russian Federation. The Government has little authority over these troops,
 who sometimes enforce their own rules rather than Kyrgyzstani law.
 The Kyrgyz Republic is a poor, mountainous country with a predominantly agri-
 cultural economy. Cotton, wool, and meat are the main agricultural products and
 exports. Other   exports  include  gold, mercury, antimony, uranium, and
 hydroelectricity. The Government has carried out progressive market reforms. The
 moderate growth apparent in most sectors has increased, and economic reform is
 now accepted by the general public. However, the level of hardship for pensioners,
 unemployed workers, and government workers with salary arrearages continues to
 be very high. Foreign assistance plays a significant role in the country's budget.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens in many
 areas, but there were problems with citizens' limited ability to change their govern-
 ment, freedom of speech and the press, due process for the accused, religious free-
 dom, and ethnic discrimination. Prison conditions remained poor. As in the past, but
 with increasing frequency, journalists were tried, arrested, and convicted under
 criminal rather than civil statutes for libeling government officials or other promi-
 nent citizens. However, in a number of cases journalists received reduced sentences
 on appeal or by pardon. At year's end, a journalist who previously was serving a
 sentence under criminal libelhad been amnestied, but eight other cases were an-
 nounced by the President's press secretary as pending. In a number of cases, the
 accused were held for months without bail before their trials. The Constitution was
 amended illegally in a 1996 referendum marred by irregularities. In general execu-
 tive domination of the judiciary made assurances of due process problematic. Local
 "village elders' courts" levied harsh sentences beyond their mandate, but abuses
 such as torture and death sentences by stoning apparently have abated. Although
 sanctioned by the Government, elders' courts are not part of the regular judicial
 structure, and the Government has made efforts to curtail their activities. The Gov-
 ernment does not fully protect freedom of religion. Concerns about ethnic discrimi-
 nation remain, but in general, the situation of minorities has improved and emigra-
 tion rates have stabilized at a low level. Violence against women is a problem that
 authorities often ignore. There is a growing number of street children.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kiling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices. There were credible reports of police bru-
 tality but these could not be substantiated. There are credible reports of police vio-
 lence against detained suspects, a holdover from the Soviet era.
 Prison conditions (including food shortages and lack of heat and other necessities)
 are poor, but not so bad as to constitute cruelty. Those detained by the MNB, rather
 than the MVD are kept in an MNB facility; after conviction, they go to a regular
 prison.
 Procedures for prison visits are not well established. In principle visitors are sel-
 dom permitted. However, some citizens, including local human rights activists,
 claim that they usually can obtain official permission for a visit through personal
 connections with the MVD. The Criminal Procedure Code of 1994 is based on the
 Soviet-era Criminal Procedure Code and established the right for attorney-client vis-
 its ofunlimited number and duration. In practice, however, an attorney must obtain
 official permission for every visit.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The judicial system continues to operate,
 in many cases, under Soviet laws and procedures, and authorities generally respect
 these provisions in practice. The prosecutor's office determines who may be de-
 tained, arrested, and prosecuted. The Interior Ministry, the IMB, and the General
 Procurator carry out investigations. Since 1990 persons arrested or charged with
 crimes have the right to defense counsel. The prosecutor's office responsible for the
 investigation often nominates the defense counsel, who is required to visit the ac-
 cused within the first 3 days of incarceration. However, sometimes the accused first
 sees defense counsel only at the trial.
 The Criminal Code permits the procurator to detain suspects for 72 hours before
 releasing them or accusing them of a crime. The procurator must issue an arrest
 warrant before a person can be detained. If a suspect is charged, the procurator
 must advise defense counsel immediately. The accused usually remains in detention
 while the prosecutor investigates and prepares the case for presentation in court.
 The prosecutor has discretion to keep the accused in pretrial detention for up to 1
 year, but there are conditions for provisional release before trial. After 1 year, the
 procurator must release the accused or ask Parliament to extend the period of de-
 tention. Since independence, there have been no known instances in which Par-
 liament has been asked to extend a detention.
 Two days before the 1995 presidential elections, the campaign chairman of an op-
 position candidate, "as well as a campaign worker, were arrested while campaigning.
 The two were charged with libeling the President by handing out leaflets saying
 that President Akayev was ethnically Kazakh. The accused and their colleagues de-
 nied having any leaflets. The two men were detained without bail (even though bail
 is usually available in cases of non-violent crimes) for 4 months and were allowed
 no visitors other than spouses or attorneys. In April 1996, they were convicted of
 libel and sentenced to 1-year suspended sentences. A third person was arrested in
 February 1996 on similar charges and held without bail until his conviction in July
 1996, at which time he was also given a 1-year suspended sentence.
 The government does not employ forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, the court system remains largely unreformed, and the executive
 branch dominates the judiciary.
 Cases originate in local courts; they may move to appeals courts on the district
 or regional level, and finally to the Supreme Court. Separate courts of arbitration
 handle civil disputes, and traditional elders' courts handle low-level crime in rural
 areas.
 The procurator brings the case to court and tries it before a judge and two peo-
 ple's assessors (pensioners or citizens chosen from labor collectives). The accused
 and defense counsel have access to all evidence gathered by the prosecutor. They
 attend all proceedings, which are generally public, and are allowed to question wit-
 nesses and present evidence. In fact nearly anyone in the courtroom may be allowed
 to question witnesses. Witnesses do not always recapitulate their evidence in court;
 instead they affirm or deny their statements in the prosecutor's files. Defendants
 in criminal cases are sometimes treated in a demeaning manner by being kept in
 cages in the courtroom.
 
 
 1153
 The court may render one of three decisions: innocent, guilty, or indeterminate,
 i.e., the case is returned to the procurator for further investigation. In May 1996,
 the Constitutional Court ruled that only the defense has the right of appeal. The
 decision of a court to return a case to the procurator for further investigation may
 not be appealed, and the accused are returned to the procurator's custody, where
 they may remain under detention.
 The procurator, not the judge, is in charge of criminal proceedings. Thus, the
 courts are widely perceived as a rubber stamp for the prosecutor and for high-rank-
 ing government officials, and not as protectors of citizens' rights. In addition very
 low judges' salaries have led to a well-grounded view among lawyers and citizens
 that all but a very few scrupulously honest judges are open tobribes.
 In the past, local elders' courts have exceeded their authority by trying major
 crimes, using torture to extract confessions, or even levying capital punishment.
 While there were no reports of abuses this year, many of the elders' courts are lo-
 cated in remote regions, making monitoring and supervision by prosecutors' offices
 extremely difficult. It is unlikely that these courts receive proper oversight.
 The Government has begun to reform the judicial system. Generally accepted
 international practices, including the presumption of the innocence of the accused,
 have been introduced. Judges do not hold positions for life. As provided in the Con-
 stitution, terms for judges range from 15 years for Constitutional Court judges to
 3 years for first term local judges. A new system of court administration is being
 instituted, and sitting judges are being tested on their knowledge of the law and
 new civil codes. If they fail these tests, they are removed from office. The process
 appears to have increased judicial professionalism and a number of judges have
 been removed due to poor performance on the exams. Some dismissals, however, ap-
 p'ear to have been subjective, but most lawyers and judges consider the system to
 be a fair measure of competence. In what may be an indication of growing judicial
 independence, the Constitutional Court ruled in November 1996 that the speaker
 of the legislative lower house had been unconstitutionally elected, since mandated
 parliamentary procedure had not been followed. The legislature accepted the Court's
 ruling and elected a new speaker.
 The appointment of ethnic Kyrgyz to key positions in the judicial system has led
 to charges by non-Kyrgyz that the system is arbitrary and unfair, and that the
 courts treat  v   more leniently than members o f other groups. Although system-
 atic discrimination is not clearly evident, it is credible in some cases. There are also
 complaints, by Uzbeks and even by ethnic Kyrgyz, that the south is underrep-
 resented in the judiciary.
 Economic crimes such as tax evasion, embezzlement, or theft of government prop-
 erty are common. Prosecution for these crimes, however, is relatively rare, and
 sometimes appears to be directed at opponents of the Government. Legislators have
 used their parliamentary immunity to avoid being brought to court.
 Many observers consider opposition activist Topchubek Turgunaliyev to be a polit-
 ical prisoner. On January 8, Turgunaliyev was convicted of embezzlement, fraud,
 and abuse of position, stemming from his service as a university rector in 1994.
 (Turgunaliyev was also convicted in April 1996 of defaming President Akayev and
 received a 1-year suspended sentence.) He was arrested in December 1996 after or-
 ganizing a demonstration in Bishkek to protest high unemployment and nonpay-
 ment of pensions. The charges on which he was convicted had been brought pre-
 viously, but dismissed for lack of evidence. The timing of the case, the lack of new
 evidence, and the disproportionately severe sentence (for alleged embezzlement of
 $10,000) suggested that the prosecution was politically motivated. Turgunaliyev was
 serving his4-year (reduced from 10-year) sentence in internal exile at a penal colony
 in a remote region of Jalalabad oblast, but was released in November and is now
 residing at his home in Bishkek on parole, required to report to government authori-
 ties once a month.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits unlawful entry into a home against the wishes of the occu-
 pant and states that a person's private life, privacy of correspondence, and tele-
 phonic and telegraphic communications are protected. The law and procedures re-
 quire the General Procurator's approval for wiretaps, searches of homes, intercep-
 tion of mail, and similar acts. A change in the law in 1995 weakened these protec-
 tions by allowing the procurator to give approval for searches over the telephone;
 thus no written proof exists to verify that the search was approved. Furthermore,
 in certain cases, law enforcement officers may first carry out a search and then get
 approval within 24 hours. If approval is not given, any evidence seized is inadmis-
 sible in court.
 Personnel and organizations responsible for violations during the Soviet period
 have remained largely in place; however, no widespread or systematic violations of
 
 
 1154
 the privacy of citizens were reported. There were concerns by citizens active in poli-
 tics or human rights issues that the privacy of their communications was violated,
 but evidence is not available.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-On December 6, President Akayev vetoed a new
 draft media law, which would have further restricted journalistic freedom. His ac-
 tion leaves in effect a 1992 law which calls for freedom of the press and mass media
 but also provides guidelines proscribing publication of certain information. The law
 supports the right of journalists to obtain information, to publish without prior re-
 straint, and to protect sources. However, it also contains provisions that the Govern-
 ment used to restrict press freedom. For example the law prohibits publication of
 material that advocates war, violence, or intolerance toward ethnic or religious
 groups; desecration of national norms, ethics, and symbols, such as the national
 seal, anthem, or flag;, publication of pornography;, and publication of "false informa-
 tion." The law also states that the press should not violate the  rivacy, honor, or
 dignity of individuals. It requires all media to register with the Ministry of Justice
 and to await the Ministry's approval before beginning to operate. The Ministry has
 ruled that foreign entities are not entitled to register. An amendment to the Con-
 stitution makes the dignity of presidents or former presidents inviolable.
 Criminal libel is not a private action. As a criminal charge, such an action must
 have, at the least, the consent of a prosecutor's office. At times other government
 agencies appear to have been involved in specific cases of criminal libel.
 There are approximately 40 to 50 independent newspapers and magazines, includ-
 ing some with local, not national, standing. There are also a few hours dailyof inde-
 pendent television broadcasting and some independent radio stations. However,
 state television and radio and government newspapers receive government sub-
 sidies, which permit the Government to influence media coverage. Additionally, the
 state printing house, Uchlan, is the only place to print newspapers. Thus, the Gov-
 ernment could be in a position to control or pressure even the independent news-
 paprs.   it  *     i
 o prin journalists were barred from practicing their profession in 1995 libel
 convictions. One has returned to journalism (although the conviction for criminal
 libel has not been overturned), but the other has not. The conviction of two cam-
 paign workers and one journalist for criminal defamation of the President during
 the election campaign of 1995 emphasized the limits to freedom of speech. These
 persons were given 1-year suspended sentences in 1996, then released (see Section
 1.e.). On September 29, the journalist Yrysbek Omurzakov was sentenced to 30
 months in a penal colony for criminal libel against a prominent industrialist. At
 year's end, this case remained under appeal. Also on September 29, the President's
 press secretary announced eight new cases of criminal libel against an opposition
 newspaper Asaba. An Osh newspaper was also threatened with court action in late
 September for "insulting the honor and dignity" of the police in alleged cases of drug
 corruption.
 A vaguely worded new Criminal Code was passed by Parliament and signed by
 President Akayev in June. It will take effect on January 1, 1998 and could poten-
 tially be used to prosecute journalists for criticizing government officials. The exist-
 ing cde was used this year to convict journalists of criminal libel. In November
 President Akayev publicly requested his legal department to draft an amendment
 to the Criminal Code transferring libel and sliander to the Civil Code.
 The editor of an opposition newspaper has arranged on five separate occasions to
 rent space in Bishkek to reestablish his newspaper, which had been suspended by
 government action. On each occasion, the deal fell through after potential landlords
 received warnings by telephone from government officials.
 Officials from the MNB (the KGB successor organization) have repeatedly con-
 tacted editors to discourage "unacceptable" types of coverage. Although the Govern-
 ment's treatment of journalists occasionally has been heavyhanded, journalistic
 standards and ethics remain uneven. For example it is not uncommon for news-
 paper articles to be inaccurate or to contain potentially libelous language. However,
 the number of criminal libel cases increased this year.
 In January and February, one newspaper, Kattama, was closed for allegedly pub-
 lishing pornography. Although regulations on pornography are not clear, this case
 does not appear to have been politically motivated. Another newspaper, Kriminal,
 was closed after one edition for alleged violations of the mass media law. The edi-
 tion had been extremely critical of the President and his wife, the Prime Minister,
 and other government officials. In May the journalists Zamira Sydykova and A.
 Alyanchikov were sentenced to 18 months in prison for criminal libel against a
 prominent industrialist. In August Sydykova was released after her appeal reduced
 
 
 1155
 the sentence to the time she had already served. She is continuing her journalist
 activities. Two other journalists were freed and forbidden to practice journalism;
 they were subsequently acquitted on appeal.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Under the Constitution, citi-
 zens have the right to assemble freely and the Government generally respects this
 right in practice.
 The Constitution provides for the right of association, and the Government gen-
 erally respects this right, although it does hinder registration to some extent.
 Permits are required for public marches and gatherings but are routinely avail-
 able. In 1996 some peaceful protests took place outside the President's office, mostly
 consisting of pensioners protesting late pension payments and market vendors pro-
 testing tax enforcement.
 There were a number of marches and demonstrations this year concerning eco-
 nomic issues, almost invariably involving picketing of the White House in Bishkek.
 For example, the Yntymak movement picketed the White House on housing and in-
 ternal migration issues on April 15. Workers from the Bishkek-Nun bread factory
 picketed on May 13 and October 8 on privatization and other social issues.
 The 1991 Law on Public Organizations, which includes labor unions, political par-
 ties, and cultural associations, requires them to register with the Ministry of Jus-
 tice. A bureaucratic mentality, dilatory work habits, and inertia, factors carried over
 from the Soviet period, probably are responsible for the delay some organizations
 experience in registering. Excessive caution by some officials is a contributing ele-
 ment. Ultimately all organizations have been able to register, with the exception of
 a Uighur organization with the stated goal of creating an independent Uighur state
 in northwest China.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution and the law provide for freedom of reli-
 gion and the right of all citizens to choose and practice their own religion; however,
 the Government does not fully protect these rights. The Government does not sup-
 port any religion and expressly forbids the teaching of religion (or atheism) in public
 schools.
 In March 1996, the Government created a new State Commission on Religious Af-
 fairs, officially in order to promote religious tolerance, protect freedom of conscience,
 and oversee laws on religion. In its early months, the Commission was not active,
 and the Government appeared to resist calls by some Orthodox and Muslim leaders
 to limit the activities of"sects" and "nontraditional religions." By the fall of 1996,
 however, the Commission became more active. The President signed a decree requir-
 ing all religious organizations to register with the commission, and a draft law on
 religion was presented to Parliament but was not passed in 1997. Under the new
 regulations, each congregation must register separately. As previously if a group
 wishes to own property, open bank accounts, and otherwise engage in contractual
 activities, it must become a legal entity by registering with the-Ministry of Justice.
 In practice, the Ministry has never registered a religious organization without prior
 registration by the Commission. There were no known instances this year of the
 Commission thwarting attempts by religious groups to register.
 During the process of reregistration the  urch of Jesus Christ, once officially
 registered, encountered difficulties with the Commission. A number of press articles
 have characterized such groups as fanning interconfessional hatred and interethnic
 tensions. The Commission claimed that it has a small staff which must process
 2,000 individual entities from 30 religious organizations. It suggested that the appli-
 cation of the Church of Jesus Christ might be processed in February 1998.
 Muslim leaders complain that the Commission makes decisions about religious
 events without consulting them. The main Baptist organization reported in 1996
 that a congregation of Baptists in Naryn oblast was denied registration both by the
 Commission for Religious Affairs and the Ministry of Justice. The church filed law-
 suits and appeals, but the courts upheld the denial of registration in 1996. The Bap-
 tists in Naryn also reported that in October 1996, police broke into their services
 and threatened worshipers. The Chairman of the Commission acknowledged that he
 was aware of the problems of the Naryn Baptists. In October the Commission in-
 formed the Baptists that the group had been registered as a religious organization.
 At year's end, the group was registered as a legal entity with the Justice and with
 local officials.
 Religious leaders note with concern that the Commission frequently uses the term
 "national security" in its statements. They also worry that references to "preserving
 interconfessional accord" could be used by traditional religious groups to prevent
 smaller churches from registering. Both Christians and Muslims have expressed
 concern about the State's apparent intention to take a more intrusive role in reli-
 gion. Ethnic Kyrgyz Christian congregations appear to face special barriers, as do
 
 
 1156
 some Muslim congregations with foreign support. A small Jewish congregation
 meets in Bishkek without a rabbi. The group also organizes informal cultural stud-
 ies and humanitarian services, chiefly food assistance for its elderly. This group has
 experienced no particular difficulties stemming from adverse government policies or
 lack of societal acceptance.
 The Seventh Day Adventist Church operate six churches in Bishkek, as well as
 several elsewhere in the country, without apparent hindrance. A Roman Catholic
 church in Bishkek also functions unhindered.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-In general government policy allows free travel within and outside the
 country. However, certain Soviet-era policies continue to complicate internal migra-
 tion resettlement, and travel abroad. Under the Soviet-era law still in force, citizens
 need official government permission (a "propiska") to work and settle in a particular
 area of the country. Strictly speaking, the "propiska" affords the right to reside in
 a given city or region. In addition home and apartment owners can legally sell their
 property only to buyers with such permission. However, in practice, many employers
 have traditionally refused to provide employment to any applicant residing illegally.
 This law, however, has not been enforced recently. People now move within the
 country, purchase homes, and sell businesses without hindrance.
 There is no law on emigration. Administrative procedures permit movement of
 people; however, citizens who apply for passports must present a letter of invitation
 from the country they intend to visit or to which they intend to emigrate. They also
 need an exit visa. There were no reports, however, that citizens, after presenting
 such a letter, were denied a passport or an exit visa. A Soviet-era law prohibits emi-
 r ation within 5 years of working with "state secrets" No one is believed to have
 een barred from emigration under this statute in 1997.
 Emigrants are not prevented from returning to Kyrgyzstan, and there is report-
 edly a small but steady flow of returnees. The Government cooperates with the of-
 fice of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian
 organizations in assisting refugees. During the summer, the International Organiza-
 tion for Migration also opene a regional eadquarters in Bishkek, in part because
 of the cooperative attitude of government officials. The issue of first asylum did not
 arise in 1997.
 There were no reports of forced return of persons to countries where they feared
 persecution, or expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status, except in
 the case of Uighur nationalists who had fled from China. One hundred or more
 Uighurs were detained and returned to China (or remanded to the Chinese em-
 bassy) for alleged visa or passport irregularities, without being processed as refu-
 gees. Clearly, at least some of these Uighurs considered themselves to be refugees.
 as they app lied for refugee status. However, few of the Uighur refuge a ~plications
 were considered by the authorities and all were refused on technicalities. The
 UNHCR has studied the case, but has taken no public position.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right df Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the constitutional right to change their government peacefully, but
 have limited ability to do so in practice.
 The Constitution mandates presidential elections every 5 years. There is a two-
 term limit. The President was reelected to a second term in 1995 in a multican-
 didate election marred by irregularities. Parliamentary elections are also held every
 5 years. In 1995 citizens elected a new Parliament in elections marred by irregular-
 ities. In February 1996, a -referendum was held that amended the Constitution to
 redistribute power within the Government. The referendum violated the Constitu-
 tion in force at the time and the Law on Referendums. Voter apathy was high, and
 turnout was low. The results were reminiscent of the Soviet era, with a reported
 turnout of 98 percent, and an approval margin of 95 percent. Ballot stuffing was
 rampant.
 The amendments approved in the 1996 referendum further strengthened the for-
 mal power of the President and his advisors, who dominate the Government. The
 Parliament and the judiciary tend to be subordinate to the executive branch, but
 show increasing signs of independence, such as by overriding presidential vetoes. In
 comparison with 1996 when the Parliament passed 66 laws, this year it passed 158
 laws (of which the President signed only 143). In April the Parliament overrode a
 presidential veto on a bill allowing a no-confidence vote on any government minister
 and not just the prime minister). In December the Parliament held up passage of
 the 1998 budget until reaching a compromise with the executive branch. The over-
 whelming majority of local government officials are not elected, but appointed by the
 President.
 
 
 1157
 
 Political parties remain weak. There were 17 registered poliic, parties some,
 such as Ata Meken, Asaba, and the Communist Party were inact e. None of the
 winners of four parliamentary seats in by-elections this year has a party affiliation.
 Likewise, parties nominated very few candidates. In Parliament less than half of the
 members (46 of 105) claims party affiliation. There are 10 parties represented in
 Parliament, but voting seldom proceeds along strict party lines.
 Women and most ethnic minorities are underrepresented in government and poli-
 tics. Only 3 of 105 parliamentary deputies are women. The Deputy Prime Minister
 for Social Issues, as well as the Ministers for Labor and Justice, are women. The
 Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court is also a woman. A women's group has
 been formed to recruit, advise, and campaign for female candidates in the next par-
 liamentary elections. Russians and Uzbeks are underrepresented in government po-
 sitions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are sometimes responsive to their views. However, activists sometimes allege that
 harassment originates within government circles. The fact that such harassment is
 sometimes featured prominently in the government press, or announced by the
 President's press secretary, lends credence to such claims.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for the rights and freedom of individuals and prohibits
 discrimination, including on the basis of language. The Government expresses a
 strong commitment to protecting the rights of members of all ethnic, religious, and
 ling1istic groups, as well as those of women, but in practice has a mixed record.
 Women.-Research conducted in 1996 on violence against women showed a notice-
 able increase in such incidents since independence. Activists note that rape is be-
 coming more common, with authorities often ignoring such attacks. Official statis-
 tics show little change in the number of crimes against women, but medical records
 present a different story, with increased hospital admissions of women who have
 been injured by a family member. Many of these incidents are alcohol related. Such
 crimes are treated by the normal criminal process if women press charges, but sta-
 tistics indicate that most such crimes go unreported. There are no shelters for bat-
 tered women. The Government has not devised a program to deal with this problem.
 The law gives equal status to women, and they are well represented in the work
 force, in professions, and in institutions of higher learning. Women are prominent
 in law, medicine, accounting, and banking. They also play an active role in the rap-
 idly growing nongovernment sector. Nonetheless, recently deteriorating economic
 conditions have had a severe effect on women, who are more likely to lose their jobs.
 It is estimated that 70 percent of the unemployed are women. Women make up the
 majority of pensioners, who are also in much worse condition than previously as in-
 flation has eroded pensions, which are often paid late. Women's groups express gen-
 eral concern about the situation of rural women. With the end of Communism, tra-
 ditional attitudes toward women are reasserting themselves strongly in the country-
 side, where women are relegated to the role of wife and mother and educational op-
 portunities are curtailed.
 Women's groups have been involved in drafting a family law intended to include
 sections on the treatment of women and children within the family. However, no
 significant action was taken on this draft legislation during the year.
 Children.-The current socio-economic situation does not effectively guarantee de-
 cent living conditions for children. Basic needs for shelter, food, and clothing often
 are not met. After independence vaccine-preventable diseases such as diphtheria,
 polio, and measles reemerged. A range of serious nutrition-related problems affect
 a large number of children, especially in rural areas. Traditional social safety meas-
 ures are  now inadequate to cope with the social pressures affecting families, and
 in a number of major cities, children are regularly observed begging or selling ciga-
 rettes. There are increasing reports of abandonment due to parents' lack of re-
 sources to care for children.
 Education is compulsory for the first nine years and the country has a 97 percent
 literacy rate. The education system, however, has suffered material and financial
 hardships, and conditions continue to deteriorate due to an acute shortage of mate-
 rial resources.
 The Government continues to rely on former Soviet law in this sphere, but is find-
 ing it increasingly ineffective in dealing with adoption issues, custody disputes, and
 
 
 1158
 similar matters. A 1994 law on adoption is still weakly implemented, and in cases
 of international adsption, is often ignored. Implementing regulations, to the extent
 that they are sta4d at all, are contradictory and confusing.
 Human rights groups and the Kyrgyz Childrn's Fund monitor the condition of
 children. Human rights groups note that children who are arrested are usually de-
 nied lawyers. Police often do not notify parents of the arrest and neither parents
 nor lawyers are generally present during questioning, despite laws to the contrary.
 Children are often intimidated into signing confessions and sometimes are placed
 in cells with adult criminals to frighten them.
 In practice children have restricted rights to travel abroad until age 16. Before
 that age, they are not entitled to their own passports and usually travel only when
 accompanying a parent, in whose passport the child's data are recorded.
 The Ky       Children's Fund (KCF) is concerned about the growing number of
 street cildren, many of whom have left home because of abusive or alcoholic par-
 ents. Although numbers are hard to estimate, a 1-day sweep through Bishkek led
 to a count of 700 children of school age working during school hours and similar
 conditions occur in other urban centers, as well as in the countryside. The KCF has
 opened two shelters, one in Bishkek (for approximately 30 children) which also
 helps train social workers and one in Osh, to provide food, clothing, and schooling
 to such children.
 The forced marriage of underage girls has become more common, and the authori-
 ties often ignore this practice. Cultural traditions and social structures discourage
 victims from going to the authorities.
 Children in rural areas are commonly called upon to pick crops as needed by their
 family farms.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no special law to protect disabled individuals,
 nor any law mandating accessibility to buildings and workplaces. Former Soviet law
 remains the basis for any resolution of complaints.
 Social facilities for the mentally disabled are severel strained, as budgets have
 fallen and workloads remain heavy. In one program facilitated by foreign volun-
 teers, local high school students have begun to visit special institutions, such as
 those for the mentally disabled.
 National /RaciallEthnic Minorities.-Reported complaints of discrimination cen-
 ter on the treatment of citizens who are not ethnic Kyrgyz. In an estimated popu-
 lation of 4.5 million, some 58.1 percent are Kyrgyz, 18 percent are ethnic Russians,
 13.9 percent are ethnic Uzbeks, and the rest are Ukrainians, Tajiks, Tatars, Ger-
 mans, and others. The latter, non-Kyryz, groups, which make up over 40 percent
 of the population, are often called the ussian-speaking minority. Members of this
 minority allege discrimination in hiring, promotion, and housing. They complain
 that government officials at all levels favor ethnic Kyrgyz. The predominance of eth-
 nic Kyiryz in government lends weight to this claim.
 Russian speakers (those who do not speak Kyrgyz) also allege that a ceiling exists
 in government employment that precludes their promotion beyond a certain level.
 The representation of ethnic Kyrgyz at high and intermediate levels of government
 is disproportionately high. This fact gives credence to perceptions that career oppor-
 tunities are limited for those who are not ethnic Kyrgyz.
 The Constitution designates Kyrgyz as the state language, but provides for preser-
 vation and equal and free development of Russian and other languages used in the
 country. In 1996 Russian was also declared, by presidential decree, an "official" lan-
 guage for some purposes. However, lawyers and others noted that no legislation re-
 ferred to "official" an  ages, so the status of Russian was no clearer than pre-
 viously. In 1997 a draft law declaring Russian an official language was declared con-
 stitutional by the Constitutional Court. To date, however, the law has been stymied
 in Parliament. Nevertheless, as a result of these efforts to improve the status of
 Russian, as well as difficult economic conditions in Russia, Russian emigration has
 significantly declined, with some ethnic Russians returning.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1992 Labor Law provides for the right of all
 workers to form and belong to trade unions, and there is no evidence that the Gov-
 ernment has tried to-obstruct the formation of independent unions. The Federation
 of Trade Unions of the Kyrgyz Republic (The Federation), successor to the former
 official union, remains the only trade union umbrella organization in the country,
 although unions are not required to belong to it. The Federation forms one part of
 a bilateral commission, the Cabinet, the other. Each year the two parties sign an
 agreement on "cooperation." The Federation leadership is changing, however, and
 some properties are being sold. There is one small independent union, the Union
 
 
 1159
 of Entrepreneurs and Small Business Workers, whose membership numbers in the
 tens of thousands.
 The Federation has been critical of government policies, especially privatization
 and their effect on working class living standards. The Federation still regards itself
 as being in a process of transition, during which it is adjusting its relations with
 the Government, with other unions in the former Soviet Union, and with other for-
 eign unions. A growing number of smaller unions are not affiliated with the um-
 brella organization.
 While the right to strike is not codified, strikes are not prohibited. There were
 small strikes of short duration. There were no retaliatory actions against strikers
 nor were there instances of human rights abuse directed at unions or individual
 workers.
 The law permits unions to form and join federations and to affiliate with inter-
 national trade union bodies. It calls for practices consistent with international
 standards. Since independent unions are still in their infancy, no meaningful affili-
 ation with international trade union bodies has taken place.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law recognizes the right
 of unions to negotiate for better wages and conditions. Although overall union struc-
 ture and practice are only changing slowly from those of the Soviet era, there is
 growing evidence of active union participation in state-owned and privatized enter-
 prises. The Government sets the minimum wage, and then each employer sets its
 own wage level.
 The law protects union members from antiunion discrimination, and there were
 no recorded instances of discrimination against anyone because of union activities.
 There are free economic zones (FEZ) that can be used as export processing zones.
 The minimum wage law does not apply to the approximately 3,000 workers in ordi-
 nary FEZ's.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law forbids forced or compul-
 sory labor, as well as forced or bonded labor by children, and it is not known to
 occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum age for employment is 18 years. Students are allowed to work up to 6 hours
 per day in summer or in part-time jobs from the age of 16. The law prohibits the
 use of child labor (under age 16); the Ministry of Education monitors enforcement.
 However, families frequently call upon their children to work to help support the
 family (see Section 5). Forced and bonded labor by children is not believedto occur
 (see Sction 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government mandates a national mini-
 mum wage at a level theoretically sufficient to assure a decent standard of living
 for a worker and family. The minimum wage is about $5.00 (90 soms) per month.
 In practice even the higher median wage is considered insufficient to ensure a de-
 cent standard of living for a worker and family. The Federation is responsible for
 enforcing all labor laws, including the law on minimum wages. Minimum wage reg-
 ulations are largely observed. However, enforcement of labor laws is nonexistent in
 the growing undergund economy. Market forces help wages in the unofficial sector
 to keep pace with official wage scales.
 The standard workweek is 41 hours, usually within a 5-day week. For state-
 owned industries there is a mandated 24-hour rest period in the workweek.
 Safety and health conditions in factories are poor.]espite the recent improvement
 in economic growth, the previous deterioration in enforcement of existing regula-
 tions continued to hamper investment to improve health and safety standard . A
 1992 law established occupational health and safety standards, as well as enforce-
 ment procedures. Besides government inspection teams, trade unions are assigned
 active roles in assuring compliance with these measures, but the previous economic
 deterioration in the country has made the compliance record of businesses spotty.
 Workers have the legal right to remove themselves from unsafe working conditions.
