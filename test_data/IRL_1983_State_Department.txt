 IRELAND
 The Republic of Ireland, a parliamentary democracy with a long
 tradition of the orderly transfer of power, attaches great
 importance to the observance and maintenance of human rights
 both in theory and practice. Individual liberties and civil
 rights are guaranteed and protected by the 1937 Irish
 Constitution. Ireland plays an active role in human rights
 questions in the United Nations and places strong emphasis on
 human rights in formulating foreign policy. In 1983 Ireland
 accepted the responsibility of the deputy chairmanship of the
 United Nations Human Rights Commission.
 Virtually from the end of the Irish Civil War in 1923 up to the
 present time, successive Irish Governments have had to deal with
 the problem of recurring outbreaks of violence in Northern
 Ireland and its spillover into the Republic.  In recent years,
 this spillover violence has included the assassinations of the
 British Ambassador (1976) and of Lord Mountbatten (1979), as
 well as the deaths of individual police officers, in armed
 confrontations with Irish Republican Army and Irish National
 Liberation Army elements.
 This political violence has led Irish Governments of both main
 political parties to adopt legislation to deal with acts of
 terrorism that goes beyond what would be considered "normal"
 legislation in other Western political democracies. The
 specific legislation will be discussed in the body of this
 report. In general, however, during  1983--as in preceding
 years--the Government has demonstrated a high awareness of human
 rights issues and has sought to apply such special legislation
 with fairness and balance.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 As indicated by references to the assassinations and the death
 of individual police officers in the introduction, politically
 motivated killings occur in Ireland as a spillover from the
 violence in Northern Ireland. In these cases, responsibility is
 usually claimed by such groups as the Provisional Irish
 Republican Army (PIRA) or the Irish National Liberation Army
 (INLA). These actions are strongly deplored both by the
 Government and the population as a whole. The Government uses
 the full force of the law to pursue and prosecute such cases.
 b. Disappearance
 People are not abducted, secretly arrested, or held in
 clandestine detention by the Irish authorities, nor does the
 Irish Government condone such practices by any element of
 society. Various terrorist groups have sometimes resorted to
 kidnapping for political purposes, most notably in the Herrama
 case in 1976. In August 1983, an attempt by an Irish Republican
 terrorist group to kidnap a foreign business executive was
 foiled by the Irish police. In all such cases of
 (1027)
 
 
 1028
 political kidnapping, the Irish Government uses full police
 power to either prevent or solve the crime.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from torture is provided by the general guarantees under
 the Constitution and is respected in practice. This extends
 equally to freedom from cruel and degrading punishment.
 In 1983, the Nicky Kelly case continued to cause considerable
 public controversy. See Section l-e.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution states that 'no citizen shall be deprived of
 his personal liberty save in accordance with law.' That same
 section provides for habeas corpus and requires that full
 charges, in writing, be made available to any individual placed
 under arrest. Neither in law nor in practice is anyone subject
 to arrest for the expression of political or religious views.
 Arrest is carried out openly, by warrant, and the right to a
 fair and speedy trial with full right of legal counsel exists in
 law and practice.
 Detention without charge is limited to a maximum of 48 hours.
 After this period the individual must be brought before a
 magistrate and charged, have those charges in writing, and be
 given legal representation. There are no political crimes under
 Irish law and, therefore, no political status for any convicted
 persons. A number of those convicted for terrorist offenses are
 members of the PIRA and other illegal organizations and will
 often claim political status. This claim is not recognized.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. The courts are independent of all
 external control and take pride in their 'above politics' image
 and reputation. In Ireland jury trial is the norm. In response
 to spillover violence from Northern Ireland, however, the
 Constitution provides for the creation of *special courts' to
 deal with cases where the 'ordinary courts are inadequate to
 secure the effective administration of justice, and the
 preservation of public peace and order.' The 'Offenses Against
 the State Act' of 1939 formally established such courts and
 provided that they may try persons for offenses against national
 security. The courts are similar to those established under the
 Napoleonic Code system with a panel of judges rather than a
 jury. The panel of judges is uneven in number but not less than
 three; the verdict is by majority vote. Rules of evidence
 generally are similar to those of regular courts, but the
 statement of a police chief superintendent that the accused is a
 member of an illegal organization is considered evidence of such
 membership. Court sessions are usually public but may exclude
 certain persons, except genuine press representatives. There is
 provision for free legal aid and appeal against conviction of
 sentence.
 
 
 1029
 The 1983 edition of Amnesty International's yearbook expresses
 concern about the denial of an appeal on technical grounds of
 Nicky Kelly, who was convicted before such a court in 1978.
 Kelly, along with two other defendants, was convicted of a mail
 train robbery in 1978 with the Government's case having been
 based almost entirely upon confessions. As a result of an
 appeal to the Supreme Court, Kelly's co-defendants were set free
 on the grounds that there was 'reasonable doubt* that the
 confessions had been voluntary. There were allegations at the
 time that the confessions had been obtained by physical abuse.
 A lower court dismissed these allegations as unfounded, but the
 Irish Supreme Court overturned the convictions on the grounds
 that there was sufficient *reasonable doubt* to bring the
 Government's case--based largely on those confessions--into
 question. Under Irish law, confessions obtained by duress are
 inadmissible in court. In the meantime, however, during the
 course of the initial trial, Kelly had escaped from custody and
 was not included with his co-defendants in the successful appeal
 --though he was sentenced in absentia. In 1980, Kelly returned
 to Ireland and gave himself up. He then attempted to file an
 appeal similar to the one filed by his original co-defendants.
 During Kelly's time as a fugitive, however, the statutory time
 limit during which an appeal could be filed had expired. Kelly,
 therefore, sought by court action an extension of the time limit
 and thus, the right to file an appeal against his original
 conviction.
 In late 1982, the Irish Supreme Court ruled that proper
 procedures had been followed and that Kelly was not entitled to
 such an extension. His appeal essentially was for the right to
 appeal, and that appeal was denied. This issue has become a
 source of considerable debate in Ireland with some questioning
 the fairness of the initial trial before the special court. A
 'free Nicky Kelly* group has been organized in Ireland and is
 actively campaigning to have Kelly pardoned.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In general, the basic human right of noninterference with
 personal privacy, family, home, or correspondence is observed
 and is protected under the Constitution. The Constitution,
 however, also provides that the state shall enact no law
 .providing for the grant of the dissolution of marriage.'
 Arguing that divorce is a basic human and family right, an Irish
 couple in late 1983 persuaded the European Court of Human
 Justice to review the Irish Government's denial of their right
 to a divorce as a denial of human rights.
 Section 1 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution and generally
 respected in practice. The state will endeavor to insure that
 organs of public opinion, while preserving liberty of expression
 (including criticism of government policy) shall not be used to
 undermine public order, morality, or the authority of the
 state. The article provides further that "publication or
 utterance of blasphemous, seditious or indecent matter* is an
 offense punishable by law.
 
 
 1030
 Ordinarily, such censorship as exists in Ireland is directed
 largely toward materials considered pornographic in nature.
 Nonetheless, the state-owned radio and television network, on
 the basis of the constitutional provisions dealing with public
 order and the authority of the state, have a longstanding
 practice of denying air time to representatives of Provisional
 Sinn Fein, the political wing of the illegal PIRA. In late
 1982, this prohibition was challenged before the Irish Supreme
 Court and upheld upon constitutional grounds. All other legal
 political parties are given full and regular access to both the
 public-owned radio and television facilities and the major
 independent daily newspapers. Criticism of the Government in
 such media is not only allowed but flourishes.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees these freedoms, and the Government
 respects them in practice. Certain terrorist organizations,
 however, are illegal and membership in them is an offense
 against national security. The INLA was added to this list in
 early 1983. Political parties or groups associated with such
 organizations are not proscribed.
 Labor unions have full freedom to organize independently from
 the Government, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which
 represents unions in both t1e Republic and Northern Ireland, has
 over 90 member unions with over 600,000 members. Irish unions
 are strong and militant, and industrial relations are, at times,
 volatile. Irish workers, including government employees, enjoy
 the right to strike and exercise that right. Although most
 trade union leaders engage in partisan political activity
 through membership in the Labor Party, some are active in
 smaller parties of the multiparty political system. The Irish
 Labor Party has not had formal links to the trade union movement
 since the 1930's, but many union officials and members play an
 active role in politics, either through the Labor Party or other
 parties of their choice.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Ireland is 94 percent Roman Catholic but the Irish Constitution
 guarantees freedom to all religious groups, and that is very
 much respected in practice and a source of national pride.
 There are no restrictions upon freedom of worship or association
 and no allegation of discrimination in employment, education,
 etc., based upon religious grounds. Some Irish laws, such as
 the prohibition upon divorce cited earlier, reflect the point of
 view of the majority community. This is true largely in the
 area of family law, however, and is the subject of a debate in
 Ireland in which the minority religious communities have felt
 fully at liberty to take a vocal and active role. Reflecting
 traditional religious values on the role of women in society,
 many of the family law restrictions fall most heavily upon
 women. Much of the pressure for change in these practices is
 coming from the relatively new but increasingly effective and
 articulate feminist movement in Ireland.
 
 
 1031
 The 1982 Country Report erroneously stated that the Irish
 Constitution grants a special place to the Roman Catholic
 Church. In fact, that section of the Constitution was repealed
 in 1974.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is no legal restraint upon movement within the country,
 foreign travel, emigration, or voluntary repatriation. To the
 degree that limited resources permit, Ireland has accepted
 displaced persons on a limited basis as the needs of particular
 situations required it.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Ireland is a parliamentary democracy with a consistent history
 of the orderly transfer of power by elections since the end of
 the Irish Civil War in 1923. Ireland has two major parties,
 three smaller parties, and provision for independents to stand
 for election to either house of the Irish Parliament; party
 membership is freely available to all who wish to join. The
 Constitution requires elections at least every five years, and
 this provision has always been carried out. Ireland uses a
 proportional voting system with the secrecy of the ballot fully
 safeguarded. The Government now in office is a two-party
 coalition elected in November 1982. The party leader of the
 larger of the two parties in the coalition serves as Prime
 Minister, but all government policy is subject to parliamentary
 debate and oversight including the longstanding parliamentary
 tradition of members' question time. In the November 1982
 national elections, 416 candidates of widely ranging personal
 and party points of view vied for the 165 seats being contested
 in the Dail, the Irish Parliament's lower House.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Irish Government cooperates with independent outside
 investigations of alleged human rights abuses. Amnesty
 International is quite active in Ireland adopting "prisoners of
 conscience" in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Because
 of the nature of the special courts described in Section 2,
 Amnesty International has expressed some concern about their
 conduct. Observers, including representatives of Amnesty, have
 been given free access to trials conducted in such courts.
 Ireland is active in the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission. In addition, the Government has taken an active
 role in the Helsinki process and was represented at the
 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe talks in Madrid.
 Freedom House rates Ireland "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Successive Irish Governments have successfully promoted
 industrialization and diversification, raising living standards
 considerably. The population in 1983 totaled approximately 3.5
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 66
 
 
 1032
 million and is growing at 1.2 percent a year. Life expectancy
 at birth is 72.8 years, and the infant mortality rate is 10 per
 1,000. The primary school enrollment ratio is 105 percent. The
 adult literacy rate is 98 percent. Estimated per capita income
 in 1982 was approximately $5,300.
 Over the last three years Ireland has been hurt by rising
 unemployment (15.7 percent in September 1983) and a high rate of
 inflation (11 percent projected for 1983). Nonetheless, the
 people of the country enjoy more than adequate access to food,
 shelter, health care, and education. These services are
 available without regard to race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background, or political opinion. People whose means are
 inadequate and who are not entitled to other benefits may
 receive pensions or other payments from public funds.
 In recent years women have been playing a more significant role
 in the Irish work force. Although the Constitution actually
 recognizes the woman's role in terms of "her life within the
 home," her moving into the office and marketplace has been slow
 but relatively smooth.
