 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 The Republic of Korea is governed by a directly elected President and a unicam-
 eral National Assembly that is selected by both direct and proportional election. In
 February, Kim Young Sam of the Democratic Liberal Party was inaugurated as the
 country's first chief executive who is not an ex-general in nearly three decades. In
 his first year in office, President Kim, a former opposition leader, implemented
 swee in political and economic reforms, including an anticorruption drive, which
 signifed a fundnmental policy break from the previous administration, and resulted
 in an end to the political careers of a number of key officials from that administra-
 tion.
 Responsibility for maintaining internal security lies with the National Security
 Planning Agency (NSP), the police, and the Defense Security Command (DSC). The
 Government made personnel and organizational changes in the powerful NSP and
 other security services for the announced purpose of curtailing the security services'
 involvement in domestic politics, stopping surveillance of civilians, preventing
 human rights abuses, and increasing efforts to collect foreign intelligence. The Na-
 tional Assembly   reformed  the  law  regulating  the  NSP   and  passed   an
 antiwiretapping law to curb Government monitoring of communications. The Gov-
 ernment also took a number of steps to institutionalize further, and guarantee, civil-
 ian control of the military, including replacing the Defense Security Chief and
 choosing a Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from outside of the small circle of
 military elite which had dominated the services under previous regimes. North Ko-
 rea's temporary withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, suspicions
 about its nuclear program, and the lack of progress in talks between North and
 South Korea heightened concerns about the threat posed by North Korea. Also, the
 long-standing conventional military threat posed by North Korea's arms buildup and
 the offensive deployment of its troops and weaponry remained a cause of concern.
 The ROK has become a major industrial power and world class exporter. An in-
 dustrious and literate populace drives economic growth despite a lack of natural re-
 sources, especially oil. After several years of strong grwth, the economy has slowed
 down. The gross national product as well as the Consumer Price Index increased
 by approximately 4.8 percent in 1993. Continued high levels of rural migration to
 the cities, shortages of skilled labor, unbalanced regional development, an inefficient
 agricultural sector, and inadequate infrastructure remain problems.
 In 1993 the overall human rights situation improved significantly, a result of the
 fundamental shift in attitude and policy of the Kim Young Sam administration.
 President Kim achieved two democratic, institutional reforms of an historic nature:
 the abolition of false-name bank accounts and the enactment of a government ethics
 law. The requirement that bank accounts be registered in the real names of deposi-
 tors has forced a large, hidden source of funds for political corruption into the open
 
 
 and thereby improved the transparency of government and politics. The ethics law
 requires officials for the first time to disclose their financial assets. Resignations
 and a reshuffle of judges, prosecutors, and police strengthened judicial independence
 and heightened sensifivity to individual rights within both the executive and judi-
 cial branches. Nonetheless, the Government, insisting that the National Security
 Law (NSL) is designed to thwart subversion by pro-North Korean forces continued
 to use it to violate the freedoms of expression, association and travel. The Govern-
 ment invoked the NSL less, however and NSL arrests declined by over half. Al-
 though basic labor laws, which fall short of international standards, were not re-
 formed the Government, in a fundamental shift, assumed a much more neutral
 stance between labor and management during labor disputes.
 The Government also decreed several amnesties that released, reduced the prison
 sentences of, or erased the criminal records of, hundreds of persons arrested for po-
 litically motivated acts. Police treatment of, and access to legal counsel for, suspects
 improved, although sleep deprivation continues to be used during questioning. De-
 spite marginal progress, women continued to suffer from discrimination and vio-
 lence. Nonetheless, the administration's reforms overall had a liberalizing effect on
 the society.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reported cases ofpo-
 litical or extrajudicial killings. In June, however, a riot policeman died shortly after
 being beaten by students during a street demonstration (see Section 2.b.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no accusations of disappearances during 1993.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 President Kim directed authorities to protect the human rights of suspects. For the
 first time in several years, allegations of abuse by authorities of those in custody
 for questioning declined. Nonetheless, authorities continued to place much emphasis
 on extracting confessions from suspects. Although it is government policy not to tor-
 ture or mistreat suspects, police use of sleep deprivation during questioning is wide-
 spread. In both political and nonpolitical cases, police routinely question suspects
 through the night and early morning. There were also unsubstantiated reports of
 verbal abuse during questioning.
 In a nonpolitical case, a judge ruled for the first time that prosecutors abused and
 beat a person during questioning in 1989. The judge ordered that the Government
 pay the plaintiff, a taxi driver, nearly $100,000 in compensation.
 In two political cases from the mid-1980s, the courts found policemen guilty of
 committing and covering up acts of torture. In March the Seoul high court
 reaffirmed a lower courts ruling that gave three former national police offcials-
 a vice director and two officials of the anti-Communist division-suspended prison
 sentences for attempting to cover up the 1987 death of university student Park
 Chong Chol, who died mn police custody after being tortured during questioning
 about alleged antigovernment activities. A police lieutenant's testimony about the
 coverup was the main evidence which helped convict the three officers. In August
 District Criminal Court jude ordered the rearrest of four former policemen
 for the 1985 torture of prominent dissident Kim Keun Tae and sentenced them to
 from 1  to 3 years in prison. Despite progress, however, it remained relatively rare
 for officials accused of abuse or harassment of suspects to he prosecuted.
 Conditions in Korean prisons remained Spartan, although a dissident released
 from prison in 1993 stated that conditions, including nutrition and access to reading
 materials, have improved significantly in recent years.
 Prisoners regularly exercised outdoors, and prison authorities provided vocational
 training. The most frequent complaint was that cells were not heated during the
 winter or cooled during the summer.
 Although the authorities generally put prisoners convicted of politically motivated
 acts in cells by themselves, they had frequent contact with other inmates, and condi-
 tions were otherwise similar to those for other prisoners. After arrest and question-
 ing, prisoners of all types had access to family members, relatives and others, unless
 prison authorities deemed it "inappropriate for rehabilitation, which was rare. A
 few months after the new administration took office, the Justice Ministry liberalized
 regulations to permit greater access to prisoners.
 There is little independent monitoring of prison conditions, although human
 rights monitors can see certain prisoners if approved by the prison warden. Most
 accusations of mistreatment involved persons being questioned by the authorities
 after their arrest and before indictment, rather than those who were already con-
 victed and serving their sentences in jail.
 
 
 668
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-In general, Korean law is vague with re-
 _sect to detentions and prosecutors have wide latitude to interpret the law. The
 NSL defines espionage in broad terms and permits the authorities to detain and ar-
 rest persons who commit acts viewed as supportive of North Korea and therefore
 dangerous to the Republic of Korea. Authorities arrested not only persons spying on
 behalf of North Korea but also those who exercised their freedom of speech to call
 for the downfall of the Government or to praise North Korea, its leader Kim II Sung,
 or Kim II Sung's "self-reliance" ("uche") political philosophy.
 Article 7 of the NSL permits the imprisonment for up to 7 years of persons who
 .with the knowledge that he might endanger the existence or security of the State
 or the basic order of free democracy, praised or encouraged orpropagandized for,
 or sided with the activities of an antistate organization." North Korea has been de-
 fined as an "antistate organization." Other restrictive laws still in effect are the Law
 on Assembly and Demonstration, the Social Surveillance Law (SSL), labor laws, and
 election laws.
 The Government rationale for the NSL continued to be that the Korean peninsula
 is a special case because the 1950-53 Korean war ended with the signing of an ar-
 mistice, not a peace treaty, and because Cold War tensions remain on the peninsula.
 North Korea remains a formidable military threat.
 In light of heightened concern about the North Korean threat the opposition
 Democratic Party dropped its demand for immediate reform of the NSL in 1993, but
 it still called or reform of the law regulating the NSP and passage of an
 antiwiretapping bill. In December the ruling and opposition parties approved the
 two bills in a National Assembly vote. The new NSP law restricts the agency from
 interfering in domestic politics; limits the Agency's authority to cases involving ter-
 rorism, espionage  and international crime organizations. The law also provides for
 prison sentences for NSP employees who violate the law, guarantees that detainees
 have access to legal counsel during an NSP investigation, and mandates the cre-
 ation of a National Assembly Committee to oversee the agency. The antiwiretapping
 bill lays out broad conditions under which the monitoring of telephone calls, mal
 and other forms of communication are legal; requires government officials to secure
 a judge's permission before placing wiretaps or, in the event of an emergency, after
 the fact; and provides for jail terms for those who violate this law.
 The South Korean Justice Ministry stated that arrests for politically motivated
 acts declined because the number of antigovernment protests, including acts of vio-
 lence, dropped significantly.
 The Kim Administration issued several general amnesties, which included pris-
 oners convicted of politically motivated acts; the amnesties cut by more thanhalf
 the number of people in jail for  litically motivated acts including espionage and
 violence, from approximately 676 to under 300. In March, shortly after his inau-
 guration, President Kim declared a wide-scale presidential amnesty which par-
 doned, paroled, restored the civil rights of, or commuted or reduced the sentences
 of about 5,800 persons charged under security-related laws. The presidential decree
 gave amnesty to 144 security-related prisoners, including prominent dissident Rev.
 Moon Ik Hwan, who in 1989 had traveled to North Korea without permission from
 the South Korean Government, and seven other political prisoners. Six long-term,
 elderly prisoners convicted of espionage were also released. In May, in celebration
 of Buddha's birthday the Government released about 80 convicts in jail for politi-
 cally related acts, including student activist Im Chong Suk, who in 1989 helped fel-
 low student Im Su Kyong go to Pyongyang. In a Christmas amnesty, the ROK re-
 leased on parole 44 prisoners convicted of politically motivated acts, including 20
 unionists as well as Choi I1 Bung, who was arrested in 1992 for publishing antistate
 materials.
 The Government also did not interfere in peaceful events sponsored by a South
 Korean dissident coalition led by Rev. Moon Ik Hwan to commemorate Korean Lib-
 eration Day. It is noteworthy that these events were carried out on behalf of an or-
 ganization the Government considered antistate, the "Pan-National Committee for
 eunification" ("Pomminnyon").
 In an appeals case concerning the sale of pro-North Korean materials, the Su-
 preme Court reaffirmed past rulings that it is legal under the NSL to possess anti-
 state publications for purely academic use, profit, or curiosity, but not with the in-
 tent of aiding North Korea.
 Arrests and prosecutions under the NSL continued, but their numbers declined
 significantly. NSL arrests numbered around 80, compared with 305 arrests in 1992.
 Korean human rights groups estimated that warrants remained for the arrest of
 about 300 people for violating the NSL or committing other politically motivated
 acts. The authorities publicly promised to be lenient to the maximum extent possible
 under the law if such persons turned themselves in.
 
 
 669
 Lower courts rejected the prosecution's death penalty requests for several suspects
 charged as leaders in what the Government announced in 1992 was a major North
 Korean spy ring. The courts instead sentenced them to life in prison or less. The
 most prominent spy suspect, unification and labor activist Kim Nack Joong, was
 sentenced to life in prison and fined nearly $1 million. Another suspect, long-time
 activist Kwon Tu Yong, committed suicide after learning that prosecutors would ask
 for the death penalty. The courts sentenced deputy spokesman for the opposition
 Democratic Party Kim Bu Kyom to 1 year in prison and a 1-year suspension of civil
 liberties, with a 2-year stay of execution, for his involvement in the spy case. Na-
 tional Assembly Defense Committee staffer Lee Kun Hee of the opposition Demo-
 cratic Party received a 3-year prison sentence and a 3-year suspension of civil lib-
 erties.
 In February, before President Kim's inauguration, a lower court sentenced Tae
 Jae Jun, chairman of Korea's General Student Association, to a 4-year prison term
 under the NSL and the Law on Assembly and Demonstrations. Charges included
 waving the North Korean flag, which the authorities considered an antistate act.
 The NSP arrested Hwang Sok Young, a South Korean novelist and ex-spokesman
 for "Pomminnyon" overseas, when he returned to Korea after 4 years in self-exile.
 Among the charges against Hwang are his activities for "Pomminnyon" and visits
 to North Korea. The authorities also indicted Noh Tae Hun, an ex-official of the Ko-
 rean human rights group "Mingahyop," for possession of an antistate newsletter
 published by former long-term prisoners convicted of espionage.
 The authorities continued to arrest and indict under the NSL members of the So-
 cialist Workers Alliance (Sanomaeng), which the Government considered a pro-
 North Korea organization and therefore antistate. Nonetheless, Sanomaeng arrests
 declined to about 10, compared with over 65 arrests in 1992. Courts also gave light-
 er sentences to NSL violators. When prosecutors appealed a lower court sentence
 of life in prison for Sanomaeng leader Paek Tae Woong and requested the death
 penalty, the Supreme Court instead reduced the sentence to 15 years in prison. The
 NSP arrested university instructor Cho Guk in June partly for publishing antistate
 materials, but the court gave him a suspended sentence in December.
 Warrants issued by judges are required by law in cases of arrest, detention, sei-
 zure, or search. The law does not require the authorities to seek warrants if the per-
 son is apprehended while committing a criminal act or if a judge is not available
 and the authorities think that the suspect may destroy evidence or escape capture
 if not quickly arrested. In such emergency cases, judges must issue arrest warrants
 within 48 hours after apprehension, or if a court is not located in the same county,
 72 hours. Police can detain suspects who voluntarily come in for questioning for up
 to 6 hours but must notify the suspects' families.
 Upon issuance of an arrest warrant, the security services can hold suspects during
 the investigation phase for up to 30 days before an indictment is made. Article 19
 of the NSL gives judges the power to approve requests to extend the detention pe-
 riod an additional 20 days, making detention legal for up to 50 days. The Constitu-
 tional Court, however, ruled that while the authorities can extend detention beyond
 the legal limit of 30 days for those suspected of "serious" violations such as spying
 or organizing an antistate group, they cannot do so in cases where the suspects are
 charged only with praising North Korea or failing to report NSL violations.
 The Constitution specifically provides the right to representation by an attorney.
 However, prosecutors prohibit attorneys from accompanying their clients during any
 stage of interrogation. There are often no facilities for private meetings between sus-
 pects and their attorneys. In late April, the Presidential spokesman quoted Presi-
 dent Kim as directing his aides to protect the human rights of suspects and guaran-
 tee access to legal counsel. Suspects' access to legal counsel during the investigation
 phase improve noticeably during the year. In October the Government began to
 permit suspects during the investigation phase to consult with "duty lawyers," a
 new system set up by a nongovernmental association of lawyers.
 There is a functioning system of bail.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides defendants a number
 of rights in criminal trials, including presumption of innocence, protection against
 self-incrimination, freedom from retroactive laws and double jeopardy, the right to
 a speedy trial, and the right of appeal. When a person is physically detained, his
 initial trial must be completed wit in 6 months of arrest. These rights are generally
 observed. Trials are open to the public, but the judge may restrict attendance if he
 believes the spectators may seek to disrupt the proceedings.
 The President, with the consent of the National Assembly, a ppoints the Chief Jus-
 tice and the other justices of the Supreme Court for a term of 6 years. Lower court
 justices are appointed by the Chief Justice with the consent of the other justices.
 The President also appoints the justices of the Constitutional Court.

 Judges generally allowed considerable scope for examination of witnesses by both
 the prosecution and defense. Political and criminal cases are tried by the same
 courts military courts do not try civilians. Although convictions are rarely over-
 turned, appeals often result in reduced sentences. Death sentences are automati-
 cally appealed. In recent years the judiciary has shown increasing independence,
 and that trend accelerated in 1993. In a statement released to the public in late
 June, junior judges from the Seoul civil court criticized past politica intervention
 in judicial decisions and called for reform of the judicial personnel system.
 The Government mandated disclosure of financial and real estate assets by gov-
 ernment officials, first in March, and then in June, the latter of which led to the
 resignation of many judicial officials, including the Supreme Court Chief Justice,
 Prosecutor General, and national police chief in September. In a personnel reshuffle,
 judicial officials generally considered committed to the independence and integrity
 of the judiciary were appointed, including Chief Justice Yoon Kwan, who promised
 further reforms. In a series of cases, the courts continued to rule against the Gov-
 ernment by awarding compensation to suspects abused by the authorities, punishing
 those responsible for such mistreatment, and issuing lighter sentences for politically
 motivated crimes.
 The Constitutional Court which began operation in 1988, continued to grow in
 its role of interpreting the donstitution. For example, it has upheld the confidential-
 ity of attorney-client discussions, ruling unconstitutional government tape recording
 of such talks.
 It is difficult to estimate the number of political prisoners, i.e., those jailed for ex-
 ercising their political rights unaccompanied by violence, because it is not clear
 whether particular persons were arrested for merely exercising the right of free as-
 sociation or were detained for committing or planning acts of violence or espionage.
 At year's end, Korean human rights groups claimed that political prisoners, i.e., any
 person arrested for politically motivated acts in opposition to the Government, in-
 cluding espionage and violence, numbered less than 300. It appeared that the num-
 ber of political prisoners and detainees as defined by international human rights
 standards numbered well under 100.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-In gen-
 eral the Government honors the integrity of the home and family. In the past, the
 security services conducted varying degrees of surveillance, including wiretaps, of
 political dissidents. In January released student activist Im Su Kyong charged that
 her home was under surveillance by the NSP. The Government stated, however,
 that one of its aims in reforming the security services such as the NSP was to pro-
 tect human rights. The new antiwiretapping law and reformed NSP law, passedby
 the National Assembly in December, were designed to curb government surveillance
 of civilians.
 The Government and the courts have taken a few tentative steps to limit en-
 croachments on the individual's right to privacy and to make public government doc-
 uments. For the first time, President Kim ordered government agencies to assist the
 opposition Democratic Party in releasing information about the 1973 kidnaping of
 prominent opposition leader Kim Dae Jung. To make government functioning more
 open to the public, the Foreign Ministry began to implement new regulations to de-
 classify and publicly release government documents.
 Government informants are known to be posted on and around university cam-
 puses. In May a student told reporters that police paid him to supply information
 about student activists. Persons thought to have backgrounds as political or labor
 activists are still denied some forms of employment and advancement, particularly
 in the fields of government, broadcast media, and education.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Almost all political discourse is unrestricted.
 Limits remained under the NSL on the expression of ideas that the Government
 considered Communist or pro-North Korean.
 Direct control over the print media virtually has disappeared. Nonetheless, the
 Government's indirect influence on the media remained considerable. Many journal-
 ists and editors practiced some degree of self-censorship to advance their careers.
 Many   former journalists become    public officials. Due  to  President Kim's
 anticorruption campaign, government payments of money to reporters, known as
 "chongji," have been curtailed but not halted completely.
 In June Defense Minister Kwon Young Hae lodged a libel suit against the Joong-
 Ang 1lbo newspaper for a story that the Government had banned him and 21 other
 current and former defense officials from leaving the country due to their suspected
 involvement in corruption in the purchase of certain military weapons systems. The
 Government stated that the story was false, and the newspaper dropped the story
 
 
 from later editions and published a retraction the next day. In response to the libel
 suit, prosecutors arrested the reporter who wrote the article and also questioned the
 daily's president-publisher, editor in chief, and managing and city editors. After
 Joong-Ang Ilbo officials met with the Defense and Information Ministers to apolo-
 gize personally, Defense Minister Kwon dropped the suit and authorities released
 the reporter.
 Prosecutors continued to indict, albeit less frequently than in the past, some dis-
 sidents forproducing, selling, or distributing pro-North Korean or pro-Communist
 materials. A former human rights activist, Noh Tae Hun, was indicted under the
 NSL for having copies of a newsletter published by former, elderly prisoners who
 had served sentences for spying on behalf of North Korea. In November the authori-
 ties investigated a private group for using an electronic bulletin board service to
 post antistate messages advocating a Socialist revolution and supporting the "Social-
 ist Workers Alliance group.
 Among the charges against student activist Chun Tae Jae was his involvement
 in protests in which students waved the North Korean flag. The authorities did not
 block student activists from holding a 2-hour telephone conference in May with
 North Korean students, but they did issue warrants for their arrest under the NSL.
 Listening to North Korean radio is illegal if the authorities judge it is for the pur-
 l ose of helping North Korea or an antistate organization. In March the Supreme
 ourt reaffirmed that it was legal under the NSL to possess publications "benefiting
 the enemy" for purely academic use, profit, or curiosity, but not with the intent of
 aiding "the enemy." The ruling came in the case of Kim Hyong Kun, who was in-
 dicted under the NSL for selling pro-North Korean books.
 The Government continued to allow, within its guidelines, an increase in media
 coverage of North Korea. Television networks presented edited versions of North Ko-
 rean television progams on a weekly basis. The media extensively reported on U.S.
 and South Korean alks with North Korean officials, sending reporters to cover U.S.-
 North Korean talks in New York and Geneva. In February, however, the state
 broadcasting company KBS decided not to broadcast an interview with former stu-
 dent activist Im Su Kyong, who was jailed for visiting Pyongyang in 1989 without
 the approval of the South Korean Government and was amnestied in 1992. KBS re-
 portealy decided that, if broadcast, the interview would encourage others to travel
 to North Korea without government permission.
 The Government also allowed somewhat wider public access to selected North Ko-
 rean publications. The December 1991 landmark agreements between South and
 North Korea included provisions-long advocated by South Korea-for exchanges
 and cooperation in publishing, journalism, radio and television. Nonetheless, North
 Korea's lack of progress in clearing up the nuclear issue has stymied implementa-
 tion of the North-South Korean agreements.
 There is a continued threat to academic freedom from leftist students who intimi-
 date professors whose lectures or writings contradict the students' ideology. In Sep-
 tember, 10 students were seriously inrured when student activists attempted to
 storm the office of the Kyonggi University president to demand his resignation, but
 instead they clashed with members of the school's judo club and threw firebombs
 and rocks.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Law on Assembly and
 Demonstrations prohibits assemblies considered likely to undermine public order it
 forbids outside interference in peaceful assemblies approved by the authorities. The
 law requires that the police be notified in advance of demonstrations of all types,
 including political rallies. Police must notify organizers if they consider the event
 not permissible under this law. Although the Government did not amend the law
 in practice it applied it with restraint, permitting practically all assemblies and
 demonstrations to be held. Dissidents reported that in contrast to previous practice
 the Government this year approved most applications to hold public assemblies and
 protests. Police adopted a low-key approach to peaceful protests held without police
 approval. Poice eithier allowed the demonstration to continue or transported pro-
 testers to the outskirts of the city and left them there to find their way back to the
 city. In general, police showed restraint and discipline in the face of severe provo-
 cation during violent demonstrations. In June students beat severely a riot police-
 man, who was pronounced dead an hour later.
 For the first time, the authorities permitted dissident and independent unionists
 to hold a May Day march through the city. In another first, the Government cooper-
 ated with the citizens of the southwestern city of Kwangju in peacefully commemo-
 rating the May 1980 uprising there. Up to 35,000 people attended the ceremony,
 much of which was antigovernment in content. The Government supported the
 "South-North Human Chain for Peace and Reunification" organized by the dissident
 National Council of Churches in Korea (KNCC) to commemorate Korea's Liberation
 
 
 672
 Day. The Government also did not block peaceful Liberation Day rallies held by a
 dissident coalition representing "Pomminnyon."
 Demonstrations by university students declined again in 1993, and student use
 of firebombs practically ceased. The most violent occurred in Kwangju, particularly
 at the American Center, ruling party headquarters, police stations and the provin-
 cial capitol. Contrary to the nationwide trend, violent student demonstrations in
 Kwangju increased relative to protests in 1992. In March several hundred students,
 armed with steel pipes and rocks, blocked President Kim from visiting Kwangju
 cemetery, where he planned to pay his respects to victims of the 1980 uprising there
 in order to alleviate regional tensions. Police did not attempt to remove the students
 by force.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religion. Full freedom prevails for pros-
 elytizing, doctrinal teaching, and conversion. Korea both sends and receives mission-
 aries of various faiths, and many religious groups in Korea maintain active links
 with members of similar faiths in other countries. The Government and the public
 do not discriminate against minority sects. Adherence to a particular faith confers
 neither advantages nor disadvantages in civil, military, or official life.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There is universal freedom of movement within the country. Foreign
 travel is generally unrestricted, but travel to North Korea is allowed only with gov-
 ernment approval. One of the conditions is that the trip must not have a political
 purpose, i.e., to praise North Korea or criticize the South Korean Government. Be-
 tween August 1989 and August 1992, 539 South Koreans in 18 different groups vis-
 ited North Korea, and another 2,247 contacted North Koreans with government ap-
 proval. In 1993, however, the two sides had few exchanges and no meetings at the
 prime minister level because of renewed tensions caused by North Korea s refusal
 to allow complete International Atomic Energy Agency inspections of nuclear facili-
 ties and to set up a North-South Korean nuclear inspection regime. The NSP ar-
 rested two labor activists on charges of violating the NSL for trying to visit North
 Korea.
 Following a spate of incidents in 1991 in which prosecutors used exit bans to
 apply pressure on foreign citizens in commercial disputes, the Government issued
 in January 1992 new guidelines on the impositien of exit bans on foreigners under
 the Exit and Entry Control Act. The act gives immigration authorities discretionary
 powers to block the departure of both foreigners and Koreans from Korea. The new
 guidelines provide procedures where previously there had been none but still leave
 a considerable amount of discretion to the authorities. There were no further reports
 of exit bans involving foreign citizens, although the threat of imposition of an exit
 ban remained credible.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Korean people have the right to elect their own government. The Constitu-
 tion, as amended in 1987, provides for the direct election of the President and for
 a mixed system of direct and proportional election of legislators to the unicameral
 National Assembly. The President serves a single 5-year term and may not be re-
 elected. The National Assembly's term is 4 years. There is universal suffrage for all
 citizens aged 20 or above, and elections are held by secret ballot.
 In a February 25 inaugural ceremony, the reins of government were peacefully
 transferred from Roh Tae Woo to Kim Young Sam, who became Korea's first demo-
 cratically elected, genuinely civilian chief executive in nearly 30 years. This was Ko-
 rea's second, peaceful transfer of power in less than a decade.
 President Kim instituted sweeping political reforms to reduce corruption, further
 institutionalize democracy, and improve human rights. In June President Kim won
 National Assembly approval of a public servants ethics law which required financial
 disclosures for members of the three top civil service ranks and the Assembly. In
 August President Kim instituted a real-name financial system to reduce corruption.
 President Kim reformed the security services and reinvigorated the Board of Audit
 and Inspection, which launched wideranging inquiries into government corruption.
 For reasons of culture and discrimination, women occupy few positions in govern-
 ment and the professions. There are currently 3 women in the 299-seat National As-
 sembly, all of whom were appointed to proportional representation seats based on
 their parties' showing in the 1992 elections. The only woman in the Cabinet has tra-
 ditionally been the Second Minister for Political Affairs, whose portfolio is women's
 affairs. President Kim appointed three women to cabinet positions. For the first
 time, women became the Ministers of Health and Social Affairs and of Environ-
 mental Affairs.
 
 
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several nongovernmental private organizations are active in promoting human
 rights and operate freely. Chief among these groups are the Lawyers for a Demo-
 cratic Society, the Human Rights Committee of the National Council of Churches
 in Korea, the Korean Bar Association, and "Mingahyop," an association of the fami-
 lies of political prisoners. These groups publish reports on the human rights situa-
 tion in Korea and make their views known both inside and outside the country.
 There were no credible reports of government harassment. The National Assembly
 and the major political parties all have committees concerned with various aspects
 of human rights.
 Government and ruling party officials have generally been willing to meet with
 international human rights groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Korea's conservative Confucian tradition has left women subordinate to
 men sociall , economically, and legally. Most married women do not work outside
 the home. In large companies women are often expected to resign upon marriage
 or no later than the birth of their first child. Judicial decisions in cases involving
 women petitioners or defendants are often heavily influenced by the Korean Confu-
 cian ethos, which does not accord women equal status with men. There has been
 a gradual improvement, however, in social mores and values affecting women.
 Women have full access to education, become government officials, and hold elected
 office.
 The National Assembly enacted an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) law in
 1988 and, in early 1991, the Government issued "Guidelines to Eliminate Sexual
 Discrimination in Employment." So far, however, the law and guidelines have had
 only limited effect. There are very few women who work as company executives, offi-
 casin government ministries, or lawyers.
 While women account for just over 40 percent of the economically active popu-
 lation, the average female worker's wage remained a little over half that of the aver-
 age male worker, and starting wages or female university graduates were 40 per-
 cent lower than those of their male counterparts.
 The traditional preference for male children continues in Korea today. It is esti-
 mated that when today's children reach marrying age there will be 400,000 "surplus
 bachelors." Korean law bans sex testing and abortions except when the woman's life
 is in danger, a hereditary disease would be passed along, or in case of rape or incest.
 Fetal sex testing and abortion of female fetuses, however, are still performed.
 Korea's amended Family Law, which went into effect in January 1991, permits
 women to head a household, recognizes a wife's right to a portion of the couple's
 property, and allows a woman to maintain greater contact with her offspring after
 a divorce. Although the revisions helped abused women, divorce still remains a so-
 cial taboo. Most Koreans remained unaware of the revised law, and there is little
 government or private assistance for divorced women. These factors, plus the fact
 tat employment opportunities for women are limited and that divorced women
 have dificulty remarrying, leads some women to stay in abusive situations.
 According to a survey conducted by the Health and Social Affairs Ministry, about
 60 percent of 7,500 married women nationwide responded that their spouses had
 mistreated them. Close to half the women who reported mistreatment said that it
 had occurred once or twice, and about 5 percent stated they were subject to habitual
 mistreatment. Among respondents who claimed they were physically mistroated,
 about half said that their husbands had thrown objects at them, about a quarter
 were pushed or thrown about and about 20 percent were kicked or punched. A
 5uarterof mistreated respondents attributed the mistreatment to their spouse's
 rikng. About 60 percent of 7,500 women said that they had heard about govern-
 ment-run shelters for abused women. The Ministry reported that 245 women and
 122 children used two government-run shelters. Private groups have also set up a
 hotline and a few shelters for abused women.
 A 1992 report by the National Police Agency estimated that 9.8 women per 1,000
 are raped in South Korea. Credible sources indicated a significant rise in the num-
 ber of cases reported in 1993. Whether this rise is attributable to increased violence
 or increased reporting of violence or both is uncertain. In any case, the National As-
 sembly did not pass stronger bills against rape, as proposed by the ruling and oppo-
 sition parties in 1992.
 Children.-Children's human rights and welfare have not been prominent social
 policy issues. The Government continued to devote an increasing share of the overall
 udget to social expenditures, which includes those related to the welfare of chil-
 
 
 674
 dren. A United Nations Children's Fund report rated Korea excellent in child wel-
 fare, particularly in child nutrition, health, education, and family planning. Al-
 though   vernment expenditures on education are low compared with other indus-
 trialzed-countries, Korea is notable for its very strong, Confucian commitment to
 education which government, society, and parents support at all levels.
 Child abuse has not been studied extensively, and statistics on child abuse are
 limited. Reports to the authorities, however, of child abuse nationwide numbered
 less than 50 in recent years. According to official statistics, the number of runaway
 children each year has dropped from about 7,000 in the past to approximately 1,000.
 Seoul Metropolitan Government runs a children's counseling center which inves-
 tigates reports of abuse, counsels families, and cares for runaway children. Because
 Korea does not have a specific law against child abuse, however, it is difficult to
 prosecute and punish child abusers unless they commit a crime punishable under
 a separate law.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Republic of Korea is a racially homo-
 geneous country with no ethnic minorities of significant size. Nonetheless, regional
 rivalries exist. Persons from the southwestern region (North and South ChollaProv-
 inces) have traditionally faced discrimination. Many Koreans believe that successive
 governments led by figures from    the southeastern region (North and South
 Kongsang Provinces) have deliberately neglected the economic development of the
 Cholla Provinces for political reasons. President Kim attempted to alleviate long-
 standing regional grievances, such as the brutal suppression of the May 1980
 Kwangju uprising, through more evenhanded government spending and appoint-
 ments, naming natives of the Cholla Provinces to be Prime Minister and Supreme
 Court Chief Justice.
 Centuries of isolation and a history of foreign invasion and occupation engendered
 a tradition of xenophobia in Korea. Citizenship in Korea is based on blood, not loca-
 tion of birth, and Koreans must show as proof their family genealogy. Thus, Korea-
 born Chinese residents cannot obtain Korean citizenship or become public servants
 and are unlikely to be hired by major corporations. Due to legal as well as social
 discrimination, many Chinese residents in Korea have emigrated to other countries
 since the 1970's, with the number of Chinese residents decreasing from 40,000 to
 18,000 over the past several years. Amerasian children are usually able to obtain
 Korean citizenship. No formal discrimination exists. Informal discrimination, how-
 ever, is prevalent. Although a few Amerasians have achieved fame in sports or en-
 tertainment, an Amerasian is unlikely to become prominent in academia, business
 or government.
 People with Disabilities.-As Korea continues to develop economically, socially,
 and politically community and social organizations have started to focus attention
 on the issue oi the rights and treatment of handicapped and mentally ill or retarded
 people. Although there are public displays of concern for the mentally and physically
 disabled, such as the Special Olympics and television documentaries, public facilities
 for their everyday care and use remained inadequate and their general treatment
 by society discriminatory. The Government lacked adequate educational programs
 and schools for severely disabled people. The Government did not discriminate offi-
 cially against the disabled who were capable of attending regular schools, but soci-
 etal pressures and cultural biases have a strong negative impact on that access. The
 Government has not enacted legislation or otherwise mandated accessibility for the
 disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution gives workers, with the exception
 of most public service employees and teachers, the right to free association. There
 are, however, blue-collar public sector unions in railways, telecommunications, post-
 al workers, and the national medical center. The Trade Union Law specifies that
 only one union is permitted at each place of work, and all unions are required to
 notify the authorities when formed or dissolved.
 In the past, the Government did not formally recognize labor federations which
 were not part of or affiliated with the country's two legally recognized labor
 ruping-the Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU) and the independent
 Korean Federation of Clerical and Financial Workers. In 1993, however, the Labor
 Ministry officially recognized four independent white-collar federations, representing
 hospital workers, journalists, office workers at construction firms, and government
 research institutes. These decisions followed rulings in the courts in 1992 that affili-
 ation to the FKTU is not required in order to be registered as a legal labor federa-
 tion. In practice, labor federations not formally recognized by the Labor Ministry ex-
 isted and worked without government interference, except if the authorities consid-
 ered their involvement in labor disputes harmful to the nation.

 The Government, however, did arrest unionists it viewed as acting as third par-
 ties in instigating or prolonging labor disputes, as in the summer strikes at a num-
 ber of firms associated with the Hyundai business group. As a result of the fun-
 damental shift made by President Kim's administration in labor policy and govern-
 ment amnesties (20 trade unionists were amnestied in December), the number of
 jailed workers plummeted from approximately 176 in 1992 to about 20 by the end
 of 1993.
 President Kim appointed National Assemblyman Rhee In Je, a progressive, as
 Labor Minister. Unlike his predecessors Rhee said that he was labor's advocate in
 the Government and took a tough stana against an insurance company accused of
 forcing employees to resign from the union. He largely succeeded in amending labor
 regulations to comply with recent court decisions. Minister Rhee ended the Govern-
 ment's hardline policy against dissident or radical labor federations such as the
 Korea Trade Union Congress (KTUC or "Chonnohyup) and affiliates of the Korean
 Congress of Independent Industrial Federations (KCLIF). The Government met for
 the first time with dissident and independent labor federations it did not officially
 recognize, including the banned Teachers' Union. Moreover, the Government did not
 interfere in the work of the "National Labor Union Representatives Conference,"
 which was formed in March by labor federations not recognized by the Government,
 such as KTUC, KCIIF, and labor federations representing Hyundai and Daewoo
 unions. In December the President reshuffled the Cabinet and replaced Minister
 Rhee, who had been criticized heavily by the business community for his policies,
 with former National Assemblyman Nam Jae Hee.
 Government nonrecognition of a labor federation did not disable a union unless
 the union's intervention in a labor dispute was considered by the Government as
 a hindrance to the dispute's resolution or seriously threatened the national economy.
 The KTUC assisted the Hyundai Group Labor Union Association in holding coor.
 nated collective actions, including strikes, at Hyundai companies. Mediation efforts
 by the Government, including visits by the Labor Minister, failed to resolve the
 strikes. In July the Government issued warrants to arrest KTUC President Dan
 Byung Ho and seven other unionists for illegal third-party intervention. Police
 searched the groups' offiesa  a rrested the Hyundai Group Labor Union Associa-
 tion chairman andsevera other unionists. Arrest warrants remained valid for Dan
 Byung Ho and three others.
 For the first time, leaders of the banned teachers' union (Chonkyojo) met with the
 Education Minister as well as other government officials. The Government, however,
 did not lift the ban on labor activities by both public and private schoolteachers. Ko-
 rean law mandates the ban, which the Constitutional Court has upheld twice in re-
 cent years. The Government instead offered to reinstate nearly 1,500 fired teachers
 if they resigned from Chonkyojo. The Government began to reinstate teachers who
 submitted their resignations from Chonkyojo. Under the Christmas amnesty, the
 ROKG amnestied, restored the civil rights of, or made eligible for rehiring, 170
 teachers who had previously been fired for joining the teachers' union.
 There is no minimum number of members required to form a union, and unions
 may be formed without a vote of the full, prospective membership. Korea's election
 andlabor laws forbid unions from donating money to political parties or participat-
 ing in election campaigns. However, trade unionists have circumvented the ban by
 temporarily resigning their union posts and running for office on the ticket of a po-
 litica party or as anindependent.
 Strikes are prohibited in government agencies, state-ron enterprises, and defense
 industries. By law enterprises in public interest sectors such as public transpor-
 tation, utilities, public health, banking, broadcasting, and communications must
 submit to government-ordered arbitration in lieu of striking. The Labor Dispute Ad-
 justment Act requires unions to notify the Ministry of Laor of their intention to
 strike and mandates a 10-day "cooling-off period" before a strike may legally begin.
 (This period is 15 days in public interest sectors.) Overall membership in Korean
 labor unions has been declining over the last several years, largely because the ex-
 plosion in labor organizing in 1987-89 let the movement divided but well com-
 pensated and worker rights significantly improved.
 The FKTU is affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 (ICFTU). Most of the FKTU's 20 constituent federations maintain affiliations with
 international trade secretariats, as do KCIIF white collar federations and the KTUC
 Metalworkers Council. In March the ICFTU held a conference in Seoul to discuss
 labor law reform, which brought together mainstream, independent, and dissident
 Korean trade unionists, as well as Korean and foreign exprts. In November the
 Friedrich Ebert Institute organized a similar conference in 8eul under the sponsor-
 ship of eight international trade union secretariats.

 In response to freedom of association complaints lodged by Korean dissident and
 independent unions, the International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee on
 Freedom of Association (CFA) issued an interim report in March which rec-
 ommended that the Government bring Korean labor law and policy up to inter-
 national worker rights standards. In November the CFA again recommended that
 the Government reform labor laws in accordance "with the principles of freedom of
 association."
 The Government under President Kim adopted a policy of persuasion and medi-
 ation to settle strikes. To settle strikes and work stoppages at 10 Hyundai compa-
 nies, President Kim, for only the second time in Korea's history, ordered binding
 government arbitration to resolve the strike at Hyundai's auto factory. Police inter-
 vention in labor disputes dropped dramatically, and the number of labor disputes
 again declined in 1993. In the summer, the Government deployed riot police du
 strikes and work stoppages at Hyundai companies. There were only two repo
 incidents of police breaking up strikes, at Hyundai Precision and Apollo Auto Parts.
 There were no reports of employer-hired squads assaulting workers in 1993.
 Since July 1991 South Korea has been suspended from the U.S. Overseas Private
 Investment Corporation insurance programs because of a lack of significant progress
 in worker rights.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution and the
 Trade Union Law guarantee the autonomous right of workers to enjoy collective bar-
 gaining and collective action. Although the Trade Union Law is ambiguous, the au-
 thorities, backed by the courts, have ruled that union members cannot reject collec-
 tive bargaining agreements signed by management and labor negotiators. This situ-
 ation has in the past led to repudiation of contracts and wildcat strikes. Extensive
 collective bargaining is practiced. Korea's labor laws do not extend the right to bar-
 gain collectively to government employees, including employees of state or public-
 run enterprises, and defense industries. The Government's wage guidelines in 1993
 matched the wage targets negotiated between and agreed upon by the FKTU and
 the employers association.
 Companies operating in Korea's two export processing zones (EPZ's) have been
 considered public-interest enterprises whose employees' rights to organize and bar-
 gain collectively face restrictions. In practice, however, unions at EPZ companies
 have been formed, and workers in the two EPZ's exercise the right to organize and
 bargain collectively like other private sector unions.
 Korea has no independent system of labor courts. The central and local labor com-
 missions form a semiautonomous agency of the Ministry of Labor that adjudicates
 disputes in accordance with the Labor Dispute Adjustment Law. Each labor commis-
 sion is composed of equal representation from labor (represented by the FKTU),
 management, and "the public interest." Local labor commissions are empowered to
 decide on remedial measures in cases involving unfair labor practices and to medi-
 ate and, in some situations, arbitrate labor disputes. The Labor Law authorizes
 labor commissions to start conciliation and mediation of labor disputes after, not be-
 fore, negotiations break down and the two sides are locked into their positions. The
 Trade Union Law (article 39) prohibits antiunion discrimination.
 The Trade Union Law and Labor Dispute Adjustment Law forbid third-party
 intervention in unions and labor disputes by federations not recognized by the Gov-
 ernment, (such as Chonnohyup and KCIIF) but allow recognized labor federations,
 principally the FKTU, its affiliates, and five independent white-collar federations,
 to assist member unions. The ban on third-party intervention also exempts medi-
 ation efforts by lawyers, experts, and others who have the consent of both labor and
 management. The Government continued to enforce the laws against third-party
 intervention. Mutual labor-management antagonism remains a serious problem, and
 some major employers remain strongly antiunion.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution provides that no
 person shall be punished, placed under preventive restrictions, or subjected to invol-
 untary labor, except as provided by law and through lawful procedures. Forced or
 compulsory labor is not condoned by the Government and is generally not practiced.
 There were credible reports, however, of illegal foreign workers who were not paid
 back wages by their employers but who continued to work for, or live in dilapidated
 housing provided by, their employers. Credible reports exist of illegal foreign work-
 ers who were not compensated for injuries suffered on the job, and of others who
 lacked the funds to return to their home countries. There is little government assist-
 ance for illegal foreign workers in such circumstances.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Standards Law pro-
 hibits the employment of persons under the age of 13 without a special employment
 certificate from the Ministry of Labor. Because there is compulsory education until
 the age of 13, few special exrployment certificates are issued for full-time employ-
 
 
 ment. Some children are allowed to do part-time jobs such as selling newspapers.
 In order to gain employment children under 18 must have written approval from
 their parents or guardians. Employers may require minors to work only a reduced
 number of overtime hours and are prohibited from employing them at night without
 special permission from the Ministry of Labor. Child labor laws and regulations are
 clear and usually enforced when violations are found, but a shortage of inspectors
 precludes regular inspections. Child labor has not been identified in any export in-
 dustries.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government implemented a minimum
 wage law in 1988. The minimum wage level is reviewed annually. In 1993 it was
 about $10 per day (8,041 won). Companies with fewer than 10 employees are ex-
 empt from this law, and some still pay below minimum wages. Due to Korea's tight
 labor market, however, most firms pay wages well above the minimum wage in
 order to attract and retain workers. The FKTU and other unions continue to claim
 that the current minimum wage does not meet the minimum requirements of urban
 workers. The Government notes that the money an average Korean blue-collar
 worker takes home in overtime and bonuses significantly raises the total compensa-
 tion package. According to the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, 5.2 percent of
 the population lived below the poverty level in 1992.
 Discrimination occurs against foreign workers, most of whom come from China,
 the Philippines, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan to work, often illegally. The Gov-
 ernment and labor movement were largely unresponsive to protecting fundamental
 labor rights of foreign workers illegally at work in Korea, estimated by the Govern-
 ment to number about 60,000. There were credible reports of Korean employers not
 paying illegal foreign workers or providing substandard living accommodations.
 There is no government channel whereby illegal foreign workers to seek relief con-
 cerning loss of pay or unsatisfactory living and working conditions. A handful of in-
 dividual Korean churches and ministers provided some assistance to illegal foreign
 workers.
 The Labor Standards and Industrial Safety and Health Laws provide for a maxi-
 mum 56-hour workweek and a 24-hour rest period each week. Amendments to the
 Labor Standards Law passed in March 1989 brought the maximum regular work-
 week down to 44 hours. According to the Ministry of Labor, the average Korean
 worker worked 47.5 hours per week, including overtime, in 1992.
 The Government sets health and safety standards, but South Korea suffers from
 unusually high accident rates. The Ministry of Labor employs few inspectors, and
 its standards are not effectively enforced. The number of workers who suffered
 work-related accidents in 1992 declined by about 16 percent, from 128,169 to
 107,435 accidents. The Labor Ministry attributes industrial accidents to a focus on
 rapid, export-based industrialization worn out or old equipment, increased use of
 hazardous chemicals, lack of research and manpower and in the case of construc-
 tion, firms in a manpower-short sector employing unskilled workers without proper
 training. The Industrial Safety and Health Law does not guarantee that workers
 who remove themselves from dangerous work environments would not jeopardize
 their continued employment.
