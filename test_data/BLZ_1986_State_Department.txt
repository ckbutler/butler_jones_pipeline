 BELIZE
 Belize has a parliamentary form of government with a
 competitive political party system and regular local and
 national elections organized under a constitution formulated
 at the time of independence in 1981. The People's United
 Party (PUP) dominated the movement for self-government and
 independence which began in the early 1950's. The party
 controlled the government from the beginning of self-rule in
 1964 until the first post-independence national election in
 1984. At that time, the United Democratic Party (UDP) won 54
 percent of the popular vote and 21 of the 28 seats in the
 House of Representatives. The election was peaceful, open,
 and honest. The UDP currently controls seven of the eight
 municipal councils in the country, including the Belize City
 Council.
 The security apparatus consists of the Belize National Police
 (BNP) and the Belize Defence Force (BDF). The BNP, a force of
 approximately 500, has primary responsibility for law
 enforcement and maintenance of order. The BDF consists of 800
 active active duty and reserve personnel. Although internal
 security is not the BDF's principal mission, it occasionally
 assists the police in enforcement operations. Both the police
 and military operate under strict regulations governing the
 use of force. Police arrest powers are clearly defined; the
 BDF is not authorized to arrest civilians.
 Belize is a developing nation with a population of 168,000 and
 a per capita gross national product estimated at US$1,100 in
 1986. The Government favors free enterprise. Its strategy
 for achieving economic growth centers on encouraging new
 investment, both domestic and foreign. Seeking a sound
 foundation for development, the Government has successfully
 carried out recommendations to strengthen public finances
 under a December 1984 International Monetary Fund standby
 agreement.
 Constitutional protections for the fundamental rights and
 freedoms of the individual are upheld by an independent
 judicial system. A free press and competitive electoral
 politics also serve to protect civil and political rights.
 There were no cases of political violence during 1986, and the
 country's overall human rights record remained good.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Such treatment is prohibited by the Constitution and does not
 occur. Sentences for most crimes generally are lenient
 compared to sentences imposed for similar crimes elsewhere
 inthe region. Prisons continue to be seriously crowded and
 
 
 404
 BELIZE
 badly antiquated. However, prisoners are fed adequately and
 have comparatively generous social and recreational privileges.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary imprisonment. A person
 is entitled, within 48 hours of arrest, to be informed of the
 reason for detention and to be brought before a court within
 72 hours. Release on bail is allowed for all but the most
 serious criminal offenses. These procedural safeguards are
 observed routinely. Forced labor is forbidden by the
 Constitution and is not known to be practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution specifically guarantees the rights of accused
 persons to a presumption of innocence, protection against
 self-incrimination, defense by counsel, and a public trial.
 Trial by jury is mandatory in criminal cases, except for minor
 offenses decided by magistrate courts. These constitutional
 guarantees are carried out in practice. The judiciary is
 independent of the executive and is regarded as an effective
 guarantor of an equitable system of justice. Its major
 shortcoming is insufficient trained personnel at all levels,
 resulting from the inability of the Government to provide
 adequate funding. There are no political prisoners in Belize.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence:
 The Constitution provides for the protection of family life,
 personal property, the privacy of the home, and recognition of
 human dignity. No violations of these guarantees were
 reported during the past year.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are protected under the
 Constitution and are respected in practice. The Government
 controls Belize's only radio station, but a wide range of
 political opinion is presented in the country's press. The
 opposition and independent newspapers frequently are critical
 of the Government. There are 13 privately-owned television
 stations in Belize. Broadcast television in Belize is only a
 few years old, and the Government is developing a regulatory
 framework for it. Under the Broadcasting Law of 1983, a
 six-member Belize Broadcasting Authority has issued licenses
 to existing stations.
 A controversy arose in 1985 when the Authority ruled that a
 television program produced by the opposition PUP could not be
 aired since political broadcasts could be approved only in the
 context of upcoming elections. After lengthy litigation, the
 Appeals Court, the supreme authority on constitutional issues,
 ruled in 1986 that the Authority's power to regulate the
 political content of television broadcasting was
 constitutional, although it said improper procedures were
 followed in forbidding the broadcast. Both sides claimed
 victory. The final result is that programing sponsored by
 political parties will not be allowed on television, except
 during election campaigns.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The constitutional guarantees of freedom of assembly and
 association and the right to form and belong to trade unions
 are respected in practice. Permits are required to hold
 public meetings but rarely are denied.
 There are 16 registered labor unions in Belize which represent
 approximately 15 percent of the labor force. The National
 Trade Union Congress of Belize is affiliated with the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions through
 membership in the Caribbean Congress of Labor. Belizean
 unions have the right to bargain collectively and to strike.
 Labor disputes unresolved by bargaining are normally settled
 through arbitration. There are varying degrees of union
 cooperation with the political parties, but no union is
 controlled by a political party.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion. Christian denominations and
 non-Christian groups all worship freely, and there is an
 active missionary presence. Most of Belize's primary and
 secondary schools are operated by churches with support from
 the Government. Church leaders have long had close ties to
 the political establishment, and churches play an active role
 in the tasks of social and national development. No political
 party is affiliated with any particular church or religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within Belize or on
 foreign travel and emigration. Emigration is motivated by
 economic need and not by political or human rights
 considerations. Emigrants frequently return for family visits
 and sometimes resettle in Belize.
 Several thousand aliens from nearby Central American countries
 have arrived in Belize since 1980, often entering illegally
 and residing in the country without permits. Various steps
 have been taken to deal with this influx. Three thousand have
 been registered as refugees. A settlement project utilizing
 funds from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) is providing farmsteads for 105 Salvadoran families on
 Belizean government land. A program to register undocumented
 aliens was carried out in 1984. An undetermined number of
 aliens have since legalized their status; however, it is
 likely that many more remain illegally at the risk of arrest,
 fines, and deportation.
 There is no evidence that displaced persons have been
 compelled to return to their country of origin. However,
 during the past year the police have been more active in
 identifying and deporting illegal aliens who cannot claim
 refugee status. This has led to a decrease in the number of
 people seeking to register as refugees. A UNHCR-supported
 Office of Refugee Affairs is a part of the Home Affairs
 Ministry, and the UNHCR stationed a permanent representative
 in Belize in 1986.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 With the general election of December 1984 and municipal
 elections in March 1985, Belize experienced a peaceful
 transfer of power from the PUP to the UDP. Although the
 ruling party's parliamentary majority gives it broad freedom
 to decide government policy, its exercise of authority is
 limited by public opinion, a free press, an independent
 judiciary, and competitive electoral politics. The major
 parties have broad political bases encompassing the country's
 principal ethnic groups.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No international entities have asked to investigate the human
 rights situation in Belize. A private human rights council
 and a branch of Amnesty International exist in Belize but are
 inactive.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 While there is no official policy of discrimination, women
 face prejudices rooted in cultural, social, and economic
 practice. Nonetheless they are active in the nation's
 political parties, private voluntary organizations, churches,
 and organizations dedicated to improving the lives of women in
 Belize. Women are prominent in local and national government
 and well represented in the professions. The Governor
 General, who represents Queen Elizabeth II in her capacity as
 Belizean Head of State, is a woman, as is the President of the
 Senate. Women hold officer and enlisted positions in the
 police and the BDF.
 There is no discrimination because of religious preference.
 There is a significant Spanish-speaking minority in Belize
 which has the same protections granted the majority. This
 minority, however, is not fully integrated into the economic
 and political life of the country.'
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Minimum ages for employment of children have been established
 at 14 years for work in retail establishments and at 17 years
 for any work near hazardous machinery. Minimum wages have
 been established for many occupations, and there are
 occupational safety regulations, although a shortage of
 resources makes it difficult for the Government to enforce
 them.
