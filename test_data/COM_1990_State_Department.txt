 COMOROS
 Located in the Mozambique Channel between East Africa and
 Madagascar, the Federal and Islamic Republic of the Comoros
 comprises three islands and claims a fourth, Mayotte, which is
 still governed by France. Until his assassination in November
 1989, President Abdallah, backed by the Presidential Guard,
 presided over a de facto one-party state. Following his
 assassination, effective power was exercised by a French
 soldier of fortune and some 25 European mercenaries who were
 serving as officers of the Presidential Guard. This group,
 under pressure from France and South Africa, departed the
 Comoros on December 15, 1989, leaving command of the
 Presidential Guard in the hands of French troops who arrived
 the same day.
 French military advisers assisted throughout 1990 in helping
 the new Government restructure and reduce the regular military
 and police forces. At year's end, the restructured security
 .forces were under effective civilian control.
 Early in 1990, opposition politicians returned from exile, and
 a wide spectrum of political leaders discussed preparations
 for new presidential elections, which subsequently took place
 in two stages and under somewhat tumultuous conditions.
 Candidates from eight political parties contested the opening
 round. The acting President, Said Mohamed Djohar, emerged the
 winner in the second round runoff, while his defeated
 opponent, Mohamed Taki, refused to accept the results and
 departed the country. While allegations of fraud and
 tampering with ballot boxes were made by opposing political
 parties, most outside observers, including representatives
 from the organization of African Unity (OAU), considered that
 these instances did not decisively alter the results.
 Following his inauguration on March 20, the new President
 vowed to promote full democracy in the Comoros and later led a
 coalition of five parties, which included former opposition
 figures in ministerial positions. Legislative elections for
 the National Assembly and the promulgation of a revised
 Constitution firmly establishing a multiparty system and
 protecting basic human rights were scheduled for the end of
 the year. However, because of administrative delays, they
 were postponed until early 1991. The positive events of 1990
 were marred by the mysterious death of Said Mlindre, one of
 Mohamed Taki's supporters, while in police custody.
 Agriculture dominates the economy, but the Comoros is running
 out of arable land, and soil erosion on the steep volcanic
 slopes is exacerbating the problem. Revenues from the export
 of vanilla, essence of ylang ylang, and cloves continue to
 fall. Comoros is part of the French franc monetary zone and
 depends heavily on France for budgetary support and technical
 and security assistance.
 Human rights advanced significantly in 1990, particularly in
 the areas of freedom of speech and press, assembly and
 association, and the right of citizens to change their
 government. Despite questions raised by the Mlindre case,
 respect for the integrity of the person also appeared to be
 greater. The major threats to the Comoros' budding democracy
 are the lack of internal security arrangements and poor
 economic conditions.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no confirmed reports of such killing in 1990.
 However, the Government investigated the case of Said Mlindre,
 a telecommunications employee and member of presidential
 candidate Taki's political party, who died while in government
 custody. He and several other Taki supporters were arrested
 in August and charged with conspiracy to destabilize the
 Government and with aiding foreign mercenaries. Mlindre died
 on the night of September 15 after he lapsed into a coma while
 in detention. The Government maintains he died of natural
 causes, while his family alleges torture and poisoning. The
 family, however, would not permit an autopsy. The President
 ordered an inquiry, which allowed the press to interview
 persons who were detained along with Mlindre. According to a
 foreign diplomat who interviewed one of those detained, it
 appears that the detainees were beaten shortly after their
 arrest in August, but not afterwards. A doctor who attended
 Mlindre on the night of his death testified he was unable to
 determine whether the death was natural or inflicted because
 he lacked the means to perform an autopsy and because the
 family insisted on immediate burial. For these reasons, the
 actual circumstances may never be known. A local human rights
 group was denied permission to inspect the prison and
 interview the other detainees.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance in 1990.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were no substantiated reports of torture or other cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment in 1990.
 However, various opposition newspapers maintained that Said
 Mlindre and the others detained in August in connection with
 the alleged plot to destabilize the Government were beaten.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In 1990 there were no known cases of arbitrary arrest or
 detention, although the circumstances surrounding the
 detention of Said Mlindre and other Taki supporters had not
 been fully clarified by the end of 1990. The law provides for
 a detained person to be charged within 48 hours,.but this
 procedure was not followed in the case of Mlindre and the
 others who were arrested in August.
 Numerous opposition political figures, who had been abroad in
 self-imposed exile during the Abdallah period, returned to the
 Comoros in early 1990 to participate in the presidential
 elections. The Government issued a list declaring 96 foreign
 mercenaries persona non grata.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The 1978 Constitution provides for the equality of all
 citizens before the law and the right of all accused to
 defense counsel. The Comorian legal system applies Islamic
 
 
 81
 COMOROS
 law and an inherited French legal code. Most disputes are
 settled by village elders or by a civilian court of first
 instance. In regular civil and criminal cases, the judiciary
 is usually independent, and trials are public. The Supreme
 Court has the power to review the decisions of lower courts,
 including the Court of Appeals. National security cases--
 involving attempts to destabilize the country or overthrow the
 Government by violent means--are handled in the regular court
 system. In 1990 the only national security case related to
 the assassination of President Abdallah in November 1989, and
 is under French jurisdiction, because all the persons involved,
 including Abdallah and his alleged assailants, held French
 citizenship.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for the inviolability of home and
 property. There were no known cases of arbitrary interference
 with privacy, including correspondence, in 1990.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of expression, thought,
 and conscience, and these were generally respected during
 1990. This is in marked contrast to the experience under the
 Abdallah regime, which tended to pressure the government-owned
 radio station and semiofficial fortnightly newspaper into
 self-censorship, despite constitutional guarantees.
 Comorians discuss and criticize the Government and its leading
 personalities openly in many situations. A wide spectrum of
 political views was aired in the roundtable discussions
 leading up to the presidential elections. The election
 campaign itself was open, lively, and marked by numerous
 rallies by the eight contesting parties, which were free to
 distribute literature and posters.
 The print media also experienced a significant degree of
 openness from the beginning of the year, and several small,
 independent newspapers were published. The semiofficial
 newspaper, which became a weekly, carried reporting and paid
 political advertising by the presidential candidates during
 the election campaign. Following the election, this newspaper
 continued to report the views of opposition party leaders and
 emerging nongovernmental groups. Lack of funds and illiteracy
 are the biggest obstacles to a wide press audience.
 Foreign journals and newspapers are available, as are books
 from abroad. The Paris-based Indian Ocean Newsletter and
 Lettre de-Comores, which are often highly critical of the
 Government, arrive unhindered through the international mail.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association. Under the late President Abdallah, Comorians
 were circumspect about organizing public political gatherings,
 and political groupings kept a fairly low profile. All of
 this changed in 1990 as new political parties were formed, old
 ones were resurrected, and numerous rallies and assemblies
 
 
 COMOROS
 took place with a minimum of governmental interference. No
 political parties are banned.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 An overwhelming majority of the population is Sunni Muslim.
 The Constitution holds Islam to be the "wellspring of the
 principles and rules which guide the State and its
 institutions." The State upholds the right of non-Muslims to
 practice their faith, however. There are churches for the
 small Catholic and Protestant populations. Christian
 missionaries work in local hospitals and schools, but by local
 custom they are not allowed to proselytize.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on travel within the country or
 abroad, and exit visas are freely granted.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Under Abdallah, the right of citizens to change their
 government through peaceful means existed in theory but not in
 practice. With his death and the departure of the mercenaries
 who had led his Presidential Guard, a new political era opened
 in the Comoros. No less than 14 political groupings were
 represented in the roundtable discussions held prior to the
 elections; 8 of these fielded candidates for the elections.
 For the first time, Comorians were able to choose their new
 President from among multiple candidates. The candidates
 issued platforms of varying ideological positions, which were
 published in the semiofficial newspaper. In the second round
 runoff, Said Mohamed Djohar defeated Mohamed Taki by gaining
 55 percent of the votes. Taki claimed electoral fraud and
 continued to contest the results from abroad.
 Traditional social, religious, and economic institutions also
 importantly influence the country's political life.
 Intraisland rivalries have been a persistent and growing
 factor. Village notables and Muslim religious leaders tend to
 dominate local politics.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 After 1986 the Abdallah government did not respond to requests
 from human rights organizations, including, as far as is
 known, Amnesty International's call for an investigation
 regarding the alleged use of torture on some detainees held
 after a 1987 coup attempt. A team of observers from the OAU
 monitored the March 1990 presidential elections and declared
 it was satisfied with the conduct of the polling.
 An organization calling itself the Comorian Association for
 the Rights of Man was established in May. It has been active
 in pursuing human rights causes, including the death in
 detention of Said Mlindre, with no interference from the
 Government. The President also swiftly launched an inquiry
 into the affair, and the case received attention in the
 international press. However, no formal results of these
 inquiries had been made public by year's end.

 COMOROS
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The constitutional recognition of Islam's special status
 formalizes the deeply held but tolerant commitment of most
 Comorians to an Islamic world view. The society respects
 authority based on inheritance, age, wealth, and religious
 leadership. The Constitution formally provides for the
 equality of citizens regardless of race, sex, or religion.
 Nevertheless, within Comorian society, men have the dominant
 role. Women have the right to vote and participate, in
 theory, in the political procdss as candidates, but tradition
 has been a powerful force in discouraging women from direct
 participation in politics. A Comorian Women's Federation was
 formed in late 1989 and aims to assemble and propose "a family
 bill of rights." Women are not required to be veiled, nor are
 they barred from employment. Change in the status of women is
 most evident in the major towns. Women are finding increasing
 employment opportunities in the small paid labor force and
 generally receive wages comparable to those of men in similar
 work. Property rights do not disfavor women; for example, the
 house the father of the bride traditionally provides to the
 couple at the time of their marriage remains her property,
 even if her husband divorces her.
 Violence against women, including wife beating, occurs.
 However, medical authorities, the Women's Federation, and the
 police believe that violence against women is rare, in part
 because of the nonviolent nature of Comorian society. The
 Government has not addressed this issue specifically, however,
 and there are no studies or statistics available to help
 determine the extent of the problem. In principle, a woman
 can seek protection through the courts in the case of
 violence, but in reality the issue would most likely be
 addressed within the extended family or at the village level.
 Female circumcision is not practiced in the Comoros.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution allows workers to form unions and to strike,
 but these rights only became a reality in 1990. The
 association of workers into unions is in an early stage;
 farming on small land holdings, subsistence fishing, and petty
 commerce make up the daily activity of most of the population.
 Hence, the wage labor force is small (less than 2,000,
 excluding government employees). For the first time, groups
 of teachers, civil servants, and dock workers-which in
 previous years formed temporary associations to press their
 demands--formed into unions for purposes of collective action.
 In 1990 there were work stoppages and slowdowns by all three
 groups. The Government did not interfere with these actions,
 but the basic issues of low or late wages remained unsolved
 because of the financial and economic problems which beset the
 country.
 Unions are free to join in confederations and to associate in
 international bodies, although the state of union development
 did not permit such association in 1990. The Comoros ratified
 International Labor Organization (ILO) Convention 87 on
 freedom of association and ILO Convention 98 on the right to
 organize and bargain collectively in 1978.
 
 
 COMOROS
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There are no laws that prohibit antiunion discrimination or
 protect collective bargaining, which is still in its infancy.
 Labor legislation, to the extent that it exists, is found
 mainly in the Labor Code, which is not rigidly enforced. The
 Labor Code does not address the issue of collective
 bargaining. The private sector sets wages by employee/
 employer informal negotiations. Public workers' wages are set
 by government policy through the Ministries of Finance and
 Labor. It is now economic rather than political impediments
 which stand in the way of a more active role by labor
 organizations. Unofficial unemployment figures exceed 70
 percent.. There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution forbids forced or compulsory labor, and it is
 not practiced in the Comoros.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for the employment of children is 15, and this
 minimum is generally respected in the small wage sector.
 Child labor is not an issue due to the lack of employment
 opportunities for adolescents and young adults. Children do
 help in family units in the large subsistence sector.'
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The currently accepted minimum wage is approximately $50 per
 month, which is barely adequate to cover basic human needs.
 This is a legislated minimum wage, and it is legally binding.
 However, the hours of work in any one job rarely exceed 35
 hours per week. Most workers also have access to some
 subsistence agriculture or fishing and receive support from
 the extended family. The Government periodically reminds
 employers to respect the Labor Code, which guarantees a day
 off per week, plus a month of paid vacation per year.
 Otherwise, the Government's role in such labor-related fields
 as setting health and safety standards is minimal.
