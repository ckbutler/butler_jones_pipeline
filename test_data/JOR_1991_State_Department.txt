 JORDAN
 Jordan is a hereditary monarchy. Under the 1952 Constitution,
 the King forms and dismisses governments, may dissolve
 Parliament, and is the ultimate-arbiter of domestic and foreign
 policy. Under his guidance, the Prime Minister and the Council
 of Ministers exercise considerable responsibility for domestic
 and foreign policy. The Parliament-consisting of a Senate
 whose members are appointed by the King and a lower house whose
 members are elected--is seeking to assert greater influence
 over policy.
 Martial law directives were officially revoked July 7, but some
 of its provisions remain in force until new laws are
 promulgated. However, because of gaps in the existing legal
 framdwork, the General Intelligence Directorate (GID) and the
 Public Security Directorate (PSD) still have broad
 responsibility for internal security and wide powers to monitor
 segments of the population that they determine may pose a
 threat to the security of the regime.
 Jordan has a mixed economy, with government participation in
 key sectors, including industrial production, transportation,
 and communications. The country has limited natural resources,
 a rapidly growing population, and is highly dependent on
 foreign assistance and expatriate remittances. As a result of
 the Persian Gulf crisis, Jordan was shut out of its traditional
 markets in the Gulf and Iraq, Gulf donors stopped all financial
 assistance, commercial activity stagnated, and over 250,000
 returnees from the Gulf flooded into Jordan, raising
 unemployment and putting a heavy burden on government
 services. The Government estimated that the crisis cost Jordan
 about $4 billion in 1990-91.
 Human rights problems remain. Citizens still do not have the
 right to change their government, and important elements of
 martial law remain in operation such as the broad scope of
 police powers. However, although political parties technically
 are not yet legal (legislation is pending), parties are now
 free to organize. Physical abuse of detainees and prisoners
 continues to occur, although probably at levels reduced from
 previous years. Lack of access by attorneys or other outside
 observers in "security" cases makes it difficult to confirm
 individual cases of abuse. The Government continued in 1991 to
 carry forward the liberalization process begun in 1989. The
 martial law courts are scheduled to cease to exist after
 completion of one final case; they are to be replaced by a
 court system which, unlike its predecessor, will allow for
 judicial appeal of decisions. Many persons previously removed
 from their jobs for political reasons were reinstated during
 1991. Although there has been no lessening of the Government's
 extensive powers of detention, .these powers have been less
 widely used since 1989.
 Jordan adopted in June a National Charter intended to promote
 political pluralism, the rule of law and adherence to the
 United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and
 equality of justice and opportunity for men and women. The
 Charter is not law, but is meant as a guide for the enactment
 of laws as the liberalization process moves forward. Some
 Members of Parliament criticized the Charter as a government
 tool to usurp the role of Parliament.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 The Government does not engage in or sanction political
 killing, and there were no reports of deaths in government
 custody.   There were also no cases of vigilante killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment.
 Jordanian law provides for the humane treatment of prisoners,
 and judicial authorities have dismissed cases on the basis of
 maltreatment of defendants. Nevertheless, physical abuse of
 detainees or prisoners continues to occur, although probably on
 a smaller scale than in the past. Detainees have complained
 that they have been abused to exact confessions. A
 parliamentary committee issued a report in 1991 alleging
 torture of many of those detained in the "Mohammad's Army" case
 (see Section l.d.). The Government denied the charges. A
 credible source also alleged that a Palestinian, who was
 detained from April to June, had been tortured. The Government
 generally gives the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) access to detainees as well as prisoners (including some
 of those held at GID headquarters in Amman), but often not when
 it determines that a case involves state security. The ICRC
 eventually obtained access to the "Mohammad's Army" detainees
 (see Section l.c.). Lawyers often do not receive access to
 their clients in cases allegedly involving state security.
 Lack of this independent access in alleged security cases makes
 confirmation of abuse in specific cases difficult.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Most persons are placed in custody by Jordanian authorities in
 accordance with the criminal code, which requires filing of
 formal charges within 48 hours. The Ministry of Justice
 monitors cases to ensure that persons are charged on a timely
 basis. Persons may then be detained for 15 days, or longer if
 a court approves the Prosecutor General's request for an
 extension, before facing trial. A new draft defense law, which
 is still pending from 1990, would allow for monthly judicial
 review of detentions.
 The practice of detention without charge continued in 1991.
 The GID may detain a person without trial for an indeterminate
 period. Governors may also order arrest and detention without
 charge. Under martial law provisions, such arrests should be
 approved by the Prime Minister, or by local administrators
 serving as military governors, within 15 days. However, this
 approval is not necessary to continue the detention.
 Security forces continue to detain incommunicado (or with
 limited outside access) persons suspected of security crimes,
 such as attempted cross-border infiltration. Security criteria
 themselves were more narrowly defined by the Government than in
 the past and appeared to be used less frequently to hamper
 political opposition.
 
 
 1458
 JORDAN
 In general, relatives are notified of a person's detention.
 Courts may notify the family if the police or GID do not.
 There are cases, however, in which the families are not
 notified. There is no legal requirement that families be
 notified when a relative is detained for "security reasons," as
 defined by the security authorities. In practice, families
 usually get word through informal channels relatively
 promptly. Families also may seek information through lawyers
 or through members of Parliament. Legal or parliamentary
 inquiries are made to the Ministry of Interior or directly to
 the Prime Minister's office, and information is generally
 forthcoming.
 Some members of the Muslim Brotherhood reportedly were detained
 in April under martial law provisions in connection with
 possible cross-border infiltrations. Police in March arrested,
 but later released, members of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad,
 reportedly in connection with an earlier cross-border raid, and
 members of the Islamic Liberation Party (ILP) for distributing
 leaflets during Ramadan advocating punishing businesses which
 violate Ramadan strictures. The Government detained (some as
 early as February, but most in July) about 150 alleged members
 of an antiregime Islamic group, "Mohammad's Army"; it released
 all but 18 who were brought to trial, along with two others
 tried in absentia. The defendants were accused of planting two
 car bombs, one of which injured a GID official; planting
 explosives at banks; and plotting assassinations of a foreign
 ambassador and a Member of Parliament (see also Section l.d.).
 All defendants were found guilty. King Hussein commuted or
 reduced all sentences of death or hard labor, except for two
 defendants sentenced to death in absentia.
 In addition, several persons were detained in 1991 for acts
 which were construed by the Government as potentially
 threatening public or state security, for example, sermons in
 mosques or the distribution of leaflets on the part of the
 ILP. In these cases, detainees were released without charge
 after varying periods of detention by the GID; a group of eight
 belonging to a breakaway faction of the Jordanian Communist
 Party was detained in June and subsequently released without
 charge, allegedly for distributing leaflets slandering the
 Prime Minister. A second group of eight was detained in April
 for allegedly planning to infiltrate Israel; they were released
 without charge in October. Twelve members of the ILP were on
 trial in civilian court at the end of the year.
 The Constitution prohibits the exiling of Jordanian citizens,
 and the Government does not engage in the practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The court system is in the process of change. In 1990, after
 the suspension of most provisions of martial law, most criminal
 cases were assigned to the civilian courts. In 1991, after the
 Government technically revoked martial law in July (it will not
 be lifted completely until laws replacing it are in effect),
 the Martial Law Court was effectively closed for civilian
 cases. After it completes a final case now in progress, it
 will hear only cases involving military personnel and is being
 replaced by a new State Security.Court. There are also
 religious courts for family matters and special courts,
 including one which deals exclusively with disputes involving
 government agencies.
 
 
 1459
 
 JORDAN
 In the civilian courts, trials are held in open court, except
 in a few cases such as those involving sexual offenses.
 Defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty and are
 entitled to counsel, to question witnesses, and to choose
 whether to testify or not. Defendants facing the death penalty
 or life imprisonment must have legal counsel; if they cannot
 afford counsel, or do not wish to be represented by counsel,
 the Government must appoint one. Decisions may be appealed to
 the Appeals Court.
 In the new State Security Court, which is still awaiting a
 royal decree before being able to begin its work, defendants
 will have the right to a public trial and to appeal decisions
 to a higher court. (Martial Law Court decisions were reviewed
 by the Prime Minister but were not subject to judicial appeal;
 also, trials were not public and confessions taken while the
 defendant was held incommunicado were reportedly submitted as
 evidence.) If the State Security Court issues a death sentence
 or a prison sentence of more than 10 years, the Court of
 Cassation (the highest court) must review the decision within
 30 days. The Cassation Court will not judge the facts of the
 case or the decision, but only whether the Court properly
 applied the law.
 The new State Security Court-will use three civilian judges,
 with an option of seating two additional military judges. The
 Mohammad's Army case was the first to be handled by the State
 Security Court but, since the decree appointing civilian judges
 had not yet been issued, the defendants were tried by military
 judges. Although the court that presided over the "Mohammad's
 Army" case was called the State Security Court, the court
 operated according to the old laws, which precluded appeal to a
 higher court, but it did allow an ad hoc review of the
 sentences by the Prime Minister and the King. The defendants
 were found guilty, but their death sentences were commuted and
 their jail terms reduced by the King and the Prime Minister.
 Religious courts have jurisdiction over such family matters as
 marriage, divorce, and inheritance. The Shari'a Court handles
 all family and religious cases involving Muslims.
 Ecclesiastical courts handle similar matters for members of the
 main Christian sects. Shari'a laws are applied in matters of
 inheritance, regardless of the religion of those involved.
 However, there have been a few instances in which inheritance
 matters involving Christian families were settled according to
 Christian tradition.
 The Government says that no one is currently serving a prison
 term solely for political views. There are approximately 30
 prisoners who were convicted in military courts of crimes
 committed in pursuit of political aims; the charges in these
 cases included arms possession and terrorism, but in at least
 some of these cases the legal proceedings did not meet
 international standards for fair trial. The Government claims
 that these cases are being reviewed.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Search warrants issued by the Prosecutor General or a judge are
 required for searches of premises but not in alleged security
 matters. Arrest warrants generally are issued by the
 Prosecutor General, although judges also have the authority to
 issue them. Security personnel reportedly monitor telephones
 and correspondence; the practice is not believed to be
 
 
 1460
 JORDAN
 widespread. They also engage in surveillance of individuals.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for free speech and a free press.
 Although it permits censorship under martial law, the
 Government has stopped direct censorship of local media.
 Jordanians freely express wide-ranging opinions, including
 criticism of the Government. Some political meetings
 presumably are monitored by the GID.
 The Government owns over 50 percent of each of the four main
 daily newspapers, and, as a result of self-censorship,
 editorial opinion generally reflects the official view. The
 broadcast media is government owned and run. The Government
 continued in 1991 to counsel the press to refrain from
 commenting on matters affecting the Governments perception of
 its national interest, such as Jordan's relations with its
 neighbors during the Gulf War. The Palace'recently defended,
 on free speech grounds, a journalist who had been removed from
 his professional association for having granted an interview to
 the Israeli media.
 Foreign newspapers and magazines are widely available but are
 subject to censorship.
 Academic freedom is respected; the Government appears to have
 ended the practice of interfering with academic employment on
 political grounds.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public demonstrations require a permit; permits have been
 readily granted since the beginning of political liberalization
 in 1989. During the Gulf crisis the police restricted
 demonstrations for security reasons but only as to the time and
 area, as in the case of marches on foreign embassies.
 Although political parties technically are illegal until
 pending legislation is approved, the Government has allowed
 many putative parties to organize. Scores of political groups,
 representing a wide cross-section of views, have announced
 their intention to register as parties once legislation is in
 place. One political group whose actions are restricted is the
 Islamic Liberation Party, which has called for the extralegal
 replacement of the governmental system with an Islamic
 caliphate.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the state religion, and over 90 percent of Jordanians
 are Muslim. The Government adheres to the constitutional
 guarantee of freedom of worship, and most religions experience
 no or virtually no restrictions on their religious practices.
 Religions and sects must be registered and recognized by the
 Government in order to manage property and administer schools.
 Non-Muslim sects are not allowed to proselytize among Muslims,
 but Muslims are allowed to convert.
 The Baha'is retain a small community in Jordan. The Government
 does not recognize the Baha'i faith as a religion, and Baha'is
 have experienced some problems in the past with the
 registration of community property. Their numbers are too
 
 
 1461
 JORDAN
 small to sustain their own court, and their family legal
 matters, including marriage, must be handled in the Shari'a
 courts. Most Baha'is are unwilling to be married in these
 courts.
 A few other sects are not officially recognized by the
 Government: the Jehovah's Witnesses, the United Pentecostal
 Church, the Church of Christ, and the Mormons. Nevertheless,
 they are able to meet without harassment. The Government has
 stated that it has no objection to the Jehovah's Witnesses'
 doctrine, but it is illegal for them to organize in Jordan.
 The Witnesses' religion prohibits their taking oaths of
 allegiance, saluting flags, or serving in the armed forces.
 These religious restrictions are perceived by the authorities
 as evidence that Witnesses are unreliable and disloyal.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within.the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within the country,
 except in military areas. Foreign travel is restricted for
 married women by the requirement that they have the written
 approval of their husbands to obtain passports. As a practical
 matter, they must have permission to travel since a husband can
 place an order with immigration authorities to prevent his
 wife's travel.
 The Government has virtually ended the practice of withholding
 passports for political reasons. Previously, the GID had to
 clear all those seeking passport issuance or reissuance, and
 sometimes denied this for political reasons. Passport renewals
 for citizens residing in Jordan require only clearance from the
 police (a clean police record), not from intelligence
 authorities. However, Jordanians still must have Intelligence
 Department clearance to reside overseas. Jordanians who reside
 abroad and wish to have their passports renewed must first
 obtain GID clearance. However, laws preventing the reissuance
 of passports to those identified as politically suspect by the
 GID have been eliminated. There are no restrictions on
 emigration.
 Jordan's longstanding problems with the care of Palestinian
 refugees were compounded by a substantial influx of returnees
 from the Gulf states (perhaps over 250,000) and others as a
 result of the Gulf War. By all accounts, Jordan's treatment of
 repatriates and refugees was both humane and generous, at
 considerable expense to the Government. Jordan's registered
 Palestinian refugee population was about 916,.000 before the
 influx, 220,800 of whom resided in Jordan's 10 refugee camps
 run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). The
 Gulf crisis added about 6,000 new students to UNRWA schools and
 56,000 to government schools; there is no definitive figure for
 the number of Gulf returnees who have entered the camps to live.
 Jordan has granted full citizenship to all Palestinians who
 fled to the East Bank in large numbers following the 1948 and
 1967 Arab-Israeli wars. This amounted to a refugee population
 exceeding its own indigenous population at the time. All
 Palestinian refugees residing in Jordan prior to August 1988
 may obtain Jordanian passports and have the unrestricted right
 to live, work, and own property in Jordan. Palestinians
 residing in the West Bank may obtain 2-year passports. The
 Interior Ministry routinely grants permits for travel between
 the East Bank and the Israeli-occupied territories. Jordan has
 granted asylum even in cases that have strained relations with
 
 
 1462
 JORDAN
 neighboring states.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Jordanian citizens, although entitled to elect municipal
 officials and members of the Chamber of Deputies, are not
 ultimately in a position to change their system of government
 or its leaders. Executive and legislative powers are
 constitutionally vested in the King, who rules with the
 assistance of an appointed Council of Ministers. The
 Constitution may not be amended without the King's approval.
 Parliament is composed of an appointed Senate and an elected
 lower house. It is overshadowed by the executive branch but
 has the right to propose laws and approve or reject treaties
 and laws proposed by the Council of Ministers. The King may
 also postpone sessions of Parliament for up to 60 days; he
 postponed the fall 1991 session from October to December,
 although he had acceded to an extraordinary session earlier in
 the year. The King must approve all laws, which are then put
 into effect by royal decree.
 Although political parties remain banned until the new law is
 passed, political groups formed de facto parties and applied
 for permission to publish newspapers or newsletters. Under the
 draft law, political parties must be able to demonstrate that
 they have a certain minimum number of members and must not
 receive foreign funding. In June, a royal decree lifted the
 ban, in force since 1953, on membership in the Jordananian
 Communist party.
 Section.4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are local human and women's rights organizations which
 pursue changes in the laws through contact with Parliament and
 the Government. The Arab Organization for Human Rights also
 has an office in Amman and has publicly and privately weighed
 in with the Government on several cases, as do individual
 lawyers concerned with human rights matters. There is no
 evidence that these individuals or groups have been impeded by
 the Government in any way. The Jordan bar association also
 raises human'rights concerns with regard to laws and
 procedures, as well as with individual cases.
 Amnesty International (AI) delegations visited Jordan twice in
 1991. Among AI's concerns during its visits were prisoners
 facing the death penalty, detention without trial, mistreatment
 of detainees and prisoners, and martial law procedures. King
 Hussein later commuted the death penalties, and the prisoners
 are now serving sentences ranging from 7 1/2 to 15 years.
 The ICRC operates freely in Jordan and is generally given
 access to both prisoners and detainees and to examine
 facilities. However, the Government has on occasion refused
 the ICRC access to some detainees or prisoners, allegedly those
 being held on security grounds. The ICRC has a regular
 schedule of visits to detention facilities.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no official discrimination based on ethnicity or
 religion. Women experience legal inequality in matters of
 
 
 1463
 JORflA
 inheritance and divorce. Under Shari'a law, which applies to
 all Jordanian citizens in inheritance matters, a woman inherits
 inherits only half that of male heirs. The son is required to
 use his inheritance to support his mother and sisters, while a
 daughter is free to retain her inheritance for herself. In
 practice, non-Muslim women occasionally have been able to
 obtain rulings according to their own religious laws.
 A man may obtain a divorce more easily than a woman, but he may
 have to pay considerable compensation based on the original
 marriage contract. A woman whose husband takes additional
 wives (under Shari'a law) may seek and obtain a divorce if she
 is unwilling to live under this arrangement.
 The law requires equal pay for equal work for men and women,
 but in practice women sometimes are paid less. In addition,
 tradition constrains women's freedoms, and entry of women into
 professional and academic realms can spark resentment and
 opposition.
 Nevertheless, women have made significant strides in
 engineering, medicine, and the law. Women's groups stress that
 the problem is not so much one of laws as of social
 constraints, including women's unawareness of their rights or
 unwillingness to assert these rights. Women's groups are
 beginning to assist women in establishing small businesses and
 are trying to change current laws which put women at a
 disadvantage regarding pension and social security benefits.
 The extent of physical abuse of women is almost never discussed
 publicly, and no statistics are available. However, the
 experience of U.S. citizen wives of Jordanian men confirms that
 the problem exists at most levels of society. The Koran allows
 a husband to discipline his wife, which some may interpret as a
 license to discipline with force. Because of this Koranic
 principle, the issue is considered a personal one by the police
 and the judiciary. Sources in the medical field say that while
 they know wife beating occurs, family and cultural norms
 constrain the victim from seeking medical orjlegal help.- Wife
 beating is technically illegal and grounds for divorce, but
 legal sources report that the filing of divorce cases based on
 the grounds of wife beating is rare.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 All nongovernment workers, except foreigners, have the legal
 right to join a trade union. Workers in some government-owned
 companies, such as the airlines, are also allowed to join
 unions. Jordanian labor unions are apolitical. Union leaders
 are elected by secret ballot for I-year terms. The Jordan
 Federation of Trade Unions (JFTU) comprises 17 unions; unions
 are free not to belong to the Federation, but at the present
 time all unions are members of the Federation. All unions must
 register with the Government. Government influence over the
 JFTU began lessening with political liberalization in 1989, and
 the Federation is now seen as more independent of the
 Government. Union officials estimate that some 25 percent of
 workers are unionized.
 Labor laws forbid strikes if an arbitration committee has been
 appointed by the Government to end the dispute. A strike is
 legal only after arbitration efforts fail. The arbitration
 process has been streamlined to hasten decisions. If
 
 
 1464
 JORDAN
 arbitration fails, the matter is referred to an industrial
 tribunal, which is a formal, independent body made up of judges
 appointed by the Ministry of Labor; this body operates only
 when required. The Minister of Labor appoints judges to sit on
 individual cases. The tribunal's decisions are binding,
 although both parties to a dispute must agree to have the
 tribunal hear their case before the tribunal can consider it.
 During the arbitration or the tribunal's deliberations, strikes
 are not permitted. Government employees, who make up roughly
 half of the work force, are barred from striking. In August
 petroleum refinery workers suspended a general strike pending
 receipt of proposals from a government-created panel on pay
 raises and better health benefits. Jordanian doctors working
 at government facilities won pay raises in September after
 threatening to walk off the job. Unions are free to affiliate
 and participate in international labor bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions in Jordan have the right to organize and bargain
 collectively. JFTU member unions regularly engage in
 collective bargaining with employers. Negotiations cover a
 wide range of issues, including salaries, safety standards, and
 working conditions.
 The Constitution forbids antiunion discrimination. Allegations
 of labor discrimination may be taken to the Ministry of Labor.
 The Minister of Labor has on occasion ordered the reinstatement
 of employees removed because of their union activities.
 Duty-free trade zones, in Aqaba and Zarqa, are governed by the
 same labor provisions that apply countrywide. Private sector
 workers employed in these zones are part of a national union
 and are thus allowed to organize and bargain collectively.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Compulsory labor is forbidden by the Constitution, except in a
 state of emergency such as war or natural disaster, and it is
 not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Generally, children under age 16 may not work except in the
 case of professional apprentices, who are allowed to leave the
 standard education track and begin part-time (6 hours per day,
 no night shift) training at age 13. Labor laws protect those
 under age 16 from exploitation in the workplace. Ministry of
 Labor inspection teams attempt to enforce these laws. In
 practice, there are some instances of underage children
 working, primarily in family businesses. Despite compulsory
 education, a small number of children in more remote areas are
 kept from school by their parents to work.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no legally mandated minimum wage, but the Government
 prepares and adjusts periodically a minimum wage schedule for
 various trades, based on recommendations of an advisory panel
 composed of representatives of workers, employers, and the
 Government. Unskilled workers on average earn an amount
 adequate to provide a family a decent living by local standards.
 Laws mandate maximum work hours and paid leave: workers are
 not supposed to work more than 48 hours per week (54 hours for
 
 
 1465
 JORDAN
 hotel, restaurant, and cinema employees), and may not work more
 than 16 hours at any one stretch or more than 60 hours overtime
 per month. In practice, these rules are sometimes ignored,
 especially but not exclusively in smaller businesses.
 Employees are entitled to 1 day off weekly.
 The Labor Ministry maintains a group of full-time inspectors to
 oversee occupational health and safety standards. A
 parliamentary committee works with the Ministry to monitor the
 workplace. Jordanian law specifies a number of health and
 safety requirements for workers, including standards for
 bathrooms, drinking water, and safety and first aid equipment.
 The Government appears to administer and enforce its labor laws
 fairly but a lack of resources hinders its effectiveness.
