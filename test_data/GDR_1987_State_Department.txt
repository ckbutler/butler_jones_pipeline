 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 The German Democratic Republic (GDR) was created in 1949 as a
 Communist state out of the Soviet occupation zone of Germany.
 Approximately 380,000 Soviet troops still are stationed on its
 soil. The country is ruled by the Communist party, known as
 the Socialist Unity Party (SED), which closely resembles the
 Soviet model. Four other parties, whose existence is
 tolerated, have no real power or independence, and the SED
 leadership makes all important political, economic, and social
 decisions.
 The Government has an efficient and pervasive security
 apparatus administered by the Interior and State Security
 Ministries, which together employ approximately 300,000
 people. Despite such formidable barriers as the Berlin Wall,
 deep historical, cultural, linguistic, and family ties remain
 between the people of the GDR and those of the Federal
 Republic of Germany (FRG).
 The GDR has a highly industrialized, centrally planned economy
 in which the bulk of industrial and agricultural property is
 state owned. Small private businesses with fewer than 10
 employees are permitted. Controls are placed on the
 acquisition, inheritance, and income derived from private
 property.
 The GDR continues to restrict the fundamental freedoms of
 speech, press, religion, assembly, and travel. In 1987,
 however, it showed flexibility in the area of human contacts
 and decreed an amnesty which included most political prisoners.
 In 1987 the level of legal emigration from the GDR is expected
 to be below the level of 1986 when more than 21,500 people
 left. It appears that the total figure for 1987 is
 approximately 13,000. An estimated 300,000 to 500,000 may wish
 to leave. On the other hand, the Government has allowed an
 unusually large number of GDR citizens, many under retirement
 age, to travel to the West on short-term private visits.
 Estimates suggest that around 3 million GDR citizens traveled
 to the West in 1987, including more than 1.2 million persons
 under retirement age. By comparison, 1,773,000 East Germans
 of all ages traveled to the West in 1986, with 573,000 being
 under retirement age. In 1985 only 66,000 persons under
 retirement age were permitted such travel.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 A 1982 law codified confidential orders to border guards that
 they should open fire as a last resort to prevent a person
 from leaving the country without permission. By mid-1987,
 however, there were reports that the shooting order had been
 virtually suspended, except in cases of desertion and armed
 attack. Nevertheless, several shooting-incidents occurred
 along the Berlin Wall during the second half of 1987, the
 latest on October 29.
 There were 210 unauthorized border crossings in 1986. In
 1987, approximately 300 persons had crossed illegally. The
 Government apparently has removed some lethal barriers, such
 as automatic shooting devices and minefields, but it has
 
 
 914
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 increased the height of the border fence to 3 meters, set up
 150 kilometers of special dog-patrolled areas, and begun to
 expand its system of barriers on the inner-German border to a
 depth of approximately 20 kilomfeters.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of permanent disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Specific laws state that the life, health, and ability to work
 of arrestees and prisoners must not be jeopardized. There are
 repdrts, however, of cruel treatment by prison officials,
 including the beating and hanging of prisoners by their hands
 for periods of up to 24 hours. In addition, former prisoners
 and detainees have reported excessively harsh conditions and
 psychological strain in GDR prisons.
 The Council of Europe in September 1986 issued a report
 denouncing prison conditions in the GDR and calling on the
 Government to uphold the principles of the United Nations'
 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which it
 ratified in 1973. Prison conditions appear to be unchanged
 since the issuance of that report.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 GDR security agencies have blanket authority to detain and
 interrogate citizens on suspicion alone. GDR citizens who
 become particularly active in officially disapproved ways are
 sometimes subject to repeated harassment, such as recurrent
 police interrogations, despite the absence of formal charges.
 They may be arrested with or without warrants, merely for
 expressing dissenting views. A person held in detention does
 not have the right to a judicial review of continued detention.
 Although the criminal procedure code sets a limit of 3 months
 on investigatory proceedings, prosecuting authorities appear
 to have no difficulty in extending this period. In most
 political cpses it takes longer than 24 hours--often many
 weeks--before interested parties are notified of the arrest.
 Furthermore, the code does not specify a maximum time period
 which may elapse before a detained person may see a lawyer.
 Although the code guarantees access to a defense attorney, the
 prosecutor may arbitrarily monitor and restrict contacts
 between the defense attorney and his client.
 Charges filed in clearly political cases are often based on
 laws which are written in vague and general language. The
 penal code proirices, for instance, that the transmission of
 information "detrimental to the interests of the German
 Democratic Republic," even if it is not secret, may be
 considered treason. Laws against "antistate agitation" and
 "asocial behavior" (parasitism) are often applied selectively
 against citizens who become politically active. The broad and
 vague wording severely restricts the possibility for defense.
 Amnesty International states that it has yet to learn of an
 acquittal when a prisoner has been brought to trial under
 these laws.
 Forced labor as a means of political coercion or education is
 not practiced.

 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In cases involving security and political issues, judges may
 bar individuals or groups from open trials. Prisoners are
 allowed to choose a lawyer from a list of those available in
 their area. However, all attorneys are state employees, and
 only a handful are willing to take on political cases. Until
 investigatory proceedings are completed, prisoners may see
 their lawyers only in the presence of the police and may
 discuss only matters not related to the case. Discussion of a
 case itself usually takes place in a brief interview shortly
 before the trial. Attorneys may not make photocopies or tape
 recordings of their clients' files. Files may be reviewed
 only in court, and notes must be taken in longhand.
 Trials tend to be short and perfunctory. Constitutionally,
 the courts are under the control of the Council of State. In
 reality, they are controlled by the SED, which appoints the
 judges. Military courts try civilians only in military
 espionage cases.
 The Government does not admit to holding political prisoners,
 nor does it publish statistics which would assist in
 determining the number of political prisoners held. However,
 the FRG Ministry for Inner-German Relations has announced that
 it bought freedom for some 2,500 political prisoners from the
 GDR in 1985, for more than 1,500 in 1986, and for more than
 1,000 by July 1987. The Salzgitter Center, an FRG government
 office which monitors GDR human rights abuses, has registered
 some 25,000 prosecutions for political offenses in the GDR
 over the past 25 years. Such prosecutions have generally
 resulted in prison sentences of 18 to 24 months. Most
 observers agree that approximately half of the political
 prisoners were jailed because of efforts to emigrate.
 In the fall of 1987, the .GDR began implementing a general
 amnesty which covered all prisoners except those convicted of
 murder, espionage, and war or Nazi crimes. The terms of this
 release are considerably broader than earlier amnesties in
 1979 and 1972 and resulted in the release of 24,621 persons,
 including virtually all political prisoners by the end of the
 year.
 Estimates of the number of political prisoners prior to the
 amnesty varied widely, both because of the difficulty in
 obtaining information and the use of different definitional
 criteria. Official FRG sources spoke of *more than 1,000
 known by name," with possibly another 1,000 being held. The
 private West German-based International Society for Human
 Rights estimated that there were 6,000 political prisoners,
 while Helsinki Watch reported estimates of political prisoners
 ranging from 7,000 to 10,000.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 By law, the police need court authorization to enter and
 search a house. They may authorize entry themselves, however,
 and the courts will retroactively give approval. State
 security organs, solely on their own authority, routinely and
 legally tap telephones and open mail. Evidence thus obtained
 can be used in court. The Government has achieved its goal of
 instilling a widespread belief that state security informants
 are ubiquitous and discovery of opposition to the State is
 certain.
 
 
 916
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 Young people are not forced to join the SED's Youth Movement,
 the Free German Youth (Freie Deutsche Jugend--FDJ), but school
 and government authorities make it clear that failure to do so
 will limit educational and job opportunities. Helsinki Watch
 has reported that 15- and 16-year-olds must attend a 2-week
 paramilitary training camp where they learn such skills as
 using weapons and throwing grenades.
 GDR citizens must obtain government permission to marry
 foreigners. The Government appears to be following faithfully
 the letter of an October 1983 law which specifies that
 authorities should decide on applications for binational
 marriage- within 6 months of submission of the application.
 Assembling documents for submission can be time-consuming,
 however.
 GDR citizens in positions deemed sensitive by the Government
 may not be visited by, or even maintain contacts with, close
 relatives who live in the West. They are also not eligible to
 travel to the West. Government officials said in 1987,
 however, that the number of persons in so-called sensitive
 positions was to be substantially reduced, perhaps by
 two-thirds. There are indications that some persons previously
 barred from traveling to the West are now receiving permission.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech is severely circumscribed. Unauthorized
 public expressions of dissent are often punished with prison
 sentences. This year, probably because of the extensive
 attention focused on Berlin's 750th anniversary celebration
 and on SED First Secretary Erich Honecker's visit to the
 Federal Republic, the authorities appeared somewhat more
 reluctant to punish dissident speech and press.
 The Government controls all media and licenses all
 publications prior to distribution. The media's basic
 function is to support and strengthen the Socialist order. In
 1987 articles appeared in established journals on previously
 taboo subjects, such as AIDS, homosexuality, environmental
 pollution, and religious questions. While the overall thrust
 of these articles stresses the Government's efforts, always
 successful, to solve the problem, the mention of these topics
 marks a new development.
 Importation of most printed materials requires an official
 permit. The GDR announced during Honecker's visit to the
 Federal Republic that it would relax somewhat the stringent
 controls governing importation of printed materials. Private
 persons may now import certain specialized publications, even
 if the publications do not have a special postal license.
 Church groups may import some religious publications more
 easily.. However, the regulation elastically excludes
 literature "directed against the preservation of peace and
 containing other agitation" or "contravening the interests of
 the Socialist State and its citizens." Within the GDR,
 circulation of printed materials also requires an official
 permit.
 Western newspapers and magazines, other than politically
 acceptable publications such as those of Western Communist
 parties, are unavailable to the general public. Small
 quantities of Western journals are for sale for hard currency
 
 
 91-7
 GER14AN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 in international hotels upon request. Some libraries,
 university departments, and official institutes also receive
 Western journals, but-circulation is highly restricted. GDR
 and Western travelers may be interrogated or arrested simply
 for possessing unlicensed printed material. Contact with
 Western journalists is severely limited by law. For the
 average citizen, such contact is technically illegal. FRG
 journalists and television crews, however, were allowed to
 conduct extensive surveys and live interviews with private GDR
 citizens in connection with the Honecker visit to the Federal
 Republic.
 West German television can be viewed by 80 percent of the GDR
 populace. Some of the few areas still unable to receive West
 German television broadcasts by antenna are now installing
 cable systems. Western radio broadcasts can be heard
 throughout the country. The Government does not attempt to
 jam or otherwise hinder these broadcasts.
 The SED conceives of art and literature as a means of
 promoting political goals. Works are judged on the basis of
 their conformity to "Socialist realism," i.e., whether they
 convey a clear, optimistic view of Communist society and
 goals. Contrary views or perceptions are discouraged or
 censored. Publishing houses practice self-censorship, and
 works must receive official clearance before they are
 published, performed, or exhibited. Some works are banned
 completely. Others may be published only outside the country
 under contracts negotiated by state-run agencies, and some are
 permitted to be published, performed, or exhibited in the GDR
 only in edited form.
 Individual academic freedom is severely limited and even
 formally restricted by law. The State views education as an
 instrument for "building socialism." All areas of academic
 inquiry are strictly controlled. Teachers who allow open
 classroom discussion of unapproved themes or topics, or who
 deviate from the party line, are disciplined. Many books are
 prohibited totally. Others are permitted only in university
 libraries to which only carefully screened and authorized
 personnel are allowed access.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of assembly,
 only the Christian churches have maintained the ability to
 organize meetings without prior state approval. A
 church-organized peace march, which attracted some 1,000
 participants in Berlin in Septeinber and displayed a wide
 variety of banners and placards, some of which were not in
 conformity with government-favored themes, was the first
 unlicensed, tolerated public demonstration in memory. In June
 the police questioned hundreds of youths who had gathered near
 the Berlin Wall to listen to a rock concert held in the West
 but arrested only two persons, 26-year-old Olaf Matthes and
 his 21-year-old brother Detleff.
 The formation of private organizations or clubs also requires
 state permission. Professional associations for writers and
 artists are headed by party members and controlled by the
 State. Dissidents and critics have been expelled from them
 and are thereby deprived of important professional privileges.
 Workers do not have the right to establish and join unions of
 their own choosing. The Free German Trade Union, an appendage
 
 
 918
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 of the SED, is made up of 16 unions covering all workers and
 professionals. Its role is to enforce and promote official
 government and party policies rather than to promote members,
 interests which might conflict'with those policies. The right
 to strike does not exist. However, there have been occasional
 reports of wildcat strikes.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Th Constitution guarantees freedom of religious belief and
 worship, but the State officially promotes atheism. In
 practice, the State tolerates and even provides some financial
 subsidies for religious activity.
 In i987 three religious events evoked considerable
 international attention:
 --A massive Lutheran Assembly (Kirchentag) was held in
 Berlin for the first time since the Wall was built. The
 concluding event filled a football stadium with more than
 20,000 believers.
 --The first-ever country-wide Catholic meeting
 (Katholikentreffen) took place in Dresden, attended by 100,000
 people.
 --An American was installed as the first rabbi since 1967
 to head the small East German Jewish community.
 The State provided logistical support and allowed extensive
 media coverage of all three events by both GDR and Western
 journalists.
 Overt adherence to religious beliefs may result in
 disqualification for preferred jobs and educational
 opportunities, although the largest religious community, the
 Lutheran Evangelical Church, ias had some success in pleading
 the cases of its members who have suffered such discrimination.
 Clergy and lay members of Western churches have been permitted
 to attend church synods and conferences at a national
 ecumenical level, and some GDR religious leaders have been
 allowed to attend similar meetings in the West. The
 authorities prohibit official relations between East and West
 German congregations, and they often do not permit personal
 visits by West German clergy when they suspect church business
 will be discussed.
 The churches remain under continuing government pressure to
 watch their words and deeds, and the secret police continue to
 monitor church-sponsored events closely. While church-state
 relations during most of 1987 developed positively, there was
 serious interference in the activities of one of the
 unofficial environmental groups that operate within some
 parishes. On November 24, police raiaed the offices of one
 such group. This was the first intrusion on church-owned
 premises in many years and triggered an immediate wave of
 protest within the country and internationally. Although the
 four persons detained during the raid were soon released, the
 protesters demanded that charges against them be dropped and
 duplicating equipment seized in the raid be returned. After a
 week of intense negotiations, the attorney for the detainees
 reported that these demands would be met. This was formally
 confirmed in early January. This is the first known instance
 that the State has agreed to stop proceedings in a political
 
 
 919
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 case. The Lutheran Church remains the only institutional
 forum in which divergent opinions can be expressed with
 relative freedom. Within the churches (and at church
 functions such as synods and the Kirchentag), many issues not
 publicly discussed are openly debated.
 For some time, young men subject to universal conscription who
 are religious conscientious objectors have been able to choose
 alternative service in unarmed construction units. However,
 those opposed to any military service whatever were
 incarcerated. Recently the Government adopted a policy of
 ignoring such persons, i.e., neither drafting nor prosecuting
 them. Conscientious objectors may still face discrimination
 in schools and jobs.
 New churches continue to be built, and old ones restored, in
 limited numbers with government approval. The Government has
 demonstrated some flexibility in its treatment of minority
 religions. While it has not rescinded a ban on organized
 activities by Christian Scientists and Jehovah's Witnesses, it
 has made no effort to interfere with those activities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Most citizens can travel freely within the country, except
 within 20 kilometers of the border or near military
 installations. They are not free to change their place of
 residence without government approval. All citizens must
 carry identification cards which the police have the right to
 check at will. Because of their criminal or political
 records, including the filing of emigration applications,
 approximately 60,000 citizens carry a special identification
 card called PM-12, which in many but not all cases restricts
 domestic as well as foreign travel.
 Foreign travel is tightly controlled. Exit visas are required
 for travel to other Communist countries except Czechoslovakia,
 and travel to Poland remains restricted.
 As a rule, travel to non-Communist countries is not allowed
 until citizens reach retirement age (60 for women, 65 for
 men). On a case-by-case basis, the Government also permits
 its citizens below retirement age to travel to the West,
 chiefly the Federal Republic of Germany, on urgent family
 matters, narrowly defined as births, deaths, marriages, and
 significant birthdays and anniversaries for first-degree
 relatives (spouses, children, siblings). For the last two
 years, however, the Government has substantially eased these
 restrictions. Although the regulations have not formally
 changed, the authorities are increasingly making exceptions to
 their own rules. During 1987 some 3 million GDR citizens
 traveled to the West, including more than 1.2 million under
 retirement age. Of these, less than one-half of 1 percent
 failed to return.
 There are still many complaints, however, that the State's
 decisions on travel applications are arbitrary and
 unpredictable and that the citizen has no effective right of
 appeal. For example, in April 1987, writer Lutz Rathenow and
 photographer Harald Hauswald were denied permission to visit
 the Federal Republic at the invitation of Piper Publishing
 House and the Catholic Literature Bureau, as was the request
 of noted writer Monika Maron. Previously, however, writer
 Gabrielle Eckart, who earlier had been denied permission to
 
 
 920
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 travel, was allowed to go to the Federal Republic and later to
 the United States. Monika Maron was recently given permission
 to visit the United States for 2 months. The young GDR poet
 Uwe Kolbe has also been allowedto travel to the United States
 and to the Federal Germany.
 A law effective October 15, 1983 narrowly restricts cases of
 family reunification to first-degree relatives (parents or
 children) and spouses. Though some East Germans other than
 those with first-degree relatives have been allowed to leave,
 the narrow definition of eligibility for emigration has
 created difficulties for the large majority of applicants.
 Many successful applicants wait from 1 to 5 years for
 permission to leave, often in the meantime suffering loss of
 empldyment and even imprisonment.
 Those who left the country illegally before January 1, 1981
 are eligible to apply for permission to visit, but reportedly
 only half of those who have applied have obtained visas.
 Those who fled after 1980 face criminal prosecution if they
 return to the GDR. Those who emigrate legally must generally
 wait 5 years before they are permitted to return.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens of the GDR are not free to change the system of
 government. The leadership of the SED makes all decisions,
 and lower-level functionaries are expected to approve and
 carry them out. The SED leadership controls the Government
 and its operations, determines who will fill executive
 positions in the government apparatus, and ensures that its
 party members occupy a majority of them. Although four other
 political parties are represented in the Government, they are
 not permitted to challenge Communist leadership or control.
 The unicameral legislature, the Volkskammer (People's
 Chamber), has yet to reject a government proposal.
 All parties and mass organizations (such as trade unions) are
 represented in the National Front, which is controlled by the
 SED. For election purposes, the National Front prepares lists
 of approved candidates according to a formula which ensures
 the SED's complete domination. The list of candidates on a
 ballot exceeds the number of available seats, and a candidate
 high on the list may be rejected if more than 50 percent of
 the voters cross his name off the ballot. In such a case, a
 candidate lower on the list may be elected. This is last
 known to have happened in a provincial election over 20 years
 ago.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Although the GDR is a signatory of the Final Act of the
 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), it
 has generally taken the position that inquiries into its human
 rights policies constitute interference-in its internal
 affairs. Requests by private human rights groups in the West
 for information on human rights conditions go unanswered, and
 the Government discourages visits by such groups. Unofficial
 human rights groups are formed within the GDR from time to
 time, but their members face immediate surveillance and
 harassment by the secret police, as well as arrest if their
 activities are deemed threatening to the Government. These
 
 
 921
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 groups occasionally receive the attention of the FRG press,
 but their influence inside the GDR is small. The government-
 sponsored Committee for the Protection of Human Rights does
 not attempt to safeguard the human rights of GDR citizens but
 criticizes human rights conditions in other countries while
 denying the existence of problems in the GDR. In 1987 the GDR
 received a congressional delegation led by the chairman of the
 U.S. CSCE Commission, which discussed human rights with both
 GDR officials and private citizens.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 An extensive social welfare system provides free medical care
 to the population without discrimination. Men and women are
 treated equally in most respects.
 Almost 90 percent of women of working age are employed, and a
 comprehensive child care system exists for working parents.
 As one of the many incentives to increase the birth rate,
 women are given extensive maternity leave with pay. Women are
 given 1 day a month off to do household shopping, as are
 single fathers with custody of children. Women can be found
 in all professions. In time of war, they are liable for the
 military draft. Few women hold high positions in the party
 and Government or in most professions, although they are well
 represented in the medical profession.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Since all large industrial, retail, and agricultural
 enterprises are state owned, only 2 percent of the labor force
 is still privately employed.
 The average workweek is 43-1/2 hours, and a 2-day weekend is
 common. Shift work has become increasingly common. An
 average worker earns about $660 per month, with lower-paid
 workers receiving about $350 per month at the official
 exchange rate. Minimum paid vacation is 18 workdays a year,
 and certain persons, such as mothers with small children and
 older workers have the right to additional days of paid leave.
 Children from age 14 may work part time during vacations and
 to further their education. Children can work full time with
 parental permission between ages 14 and 18. Youths under the
 age of 18 may not work between 6 p.m. and
 6 a.m.
 Working conditions are often difficult, especially in mining
 and heavy industry. The Government has had some success,
 however, in :educing the relatively high rate of accidents in
 the workplac. I
