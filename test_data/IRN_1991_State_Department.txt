 IRAN*
 Iran is an Islamic Republic under the leadership of Ayatollah
 Ali Khamenei. The formal system of government, based on a
 Constitution approved in 1980 by popular referendum and revised
 in July 1989, features a parliament and a president elected
 from among multiple candidates by universal suffrage. However,
 all candidates must meet highly restrictive religious and
 political criteria imposed by the Council of Guardians, and as
 a result the choice offered to voters is narrow. The
 Government, dominated by a political elite composed of Shi'a
 Muslim clerics and of laymen allied with these clerics,
 attempts to impose its views on political and socioreligious
 orthodoxy. However, there remain significant factional
 differences on important economic and political issues.
 The Government's hold on power continues to be reinforced
 through arrests, summary trials and executions,'and other forms
 of intimidation implemented by an extensive internal security
 system. Political arrests are made by the Revolutionary Guards
 and by security forces operating under the Ministry of
 Intelligence and Security.
 Iran has a mixed economy. Although Islam guarantees the right
 to private ownership, the Government has nationalized the banks
 and several basic industries, including the petroleum and
 utilities sector. Oil exports are a primary source of foreign
 exchange. The disruptions of the revolution, the destruction
 from the Iran-Iraq war, devastating earthquakes in 1990, and
 government mismanagement have caused serious economic
 deterioration. Inflation is estimated at 50 to 80 percent,
 about 40 percent of the work force is unemployed, and
 corruption and black market activities are rife. Many
 industrips are operating at less than half of capacity. While
 an economic 5-Year Plan was approved in 1990, implementation of
 reconstruction programs has been slow.
 There was no evidence of significant improvement in the
 Government's human rights practices; it continues to be a major
 abuser of human rights. It was, however, difficult to know
 precisely the details and numbers of such abuses in 1991
 because of the great lengths to which the Government goes to
 keep such information secret. Domestic elements that might
 monitor and report on the Government's practices are ruthlessly
 suppressed. The Government finally allowed a December visit by
 the U.N. Special Representative for Iran, and signed an
 agreement to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) to visit prisoners. This report makes every effort to
 describe the situation in Iran accurately within the-confines
 of the Government's efforts to obfuscate its record on human
 rights.
 Abuses included summary executions; widespread torture;
 repression of the freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and
 association; arbitrary detentions; lack of fair trials;
 continuing repression of the Baha'i religious community; denial
 of citizens' right to change their government; and severe
 restrictions on women's and worker rights. In his November
 1990 report, the Special Representative concluded that "the
 enormous quantity and variety of allegations and complaints
 *Because of the absence of a United States Mission in Iran,
 this report draws heavily on unofficial sources.
 
 
 1408
 IRAN
 received from very diverse sources.. .provide a credible factual
 basis for the belief that human rights violations occur
 frequently in the country and that government action to prevent
 and remedy such violations has not-been sufficient to put an
 end to them."
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There is no reliable estimate of the number of people killed
 for political reasons in 1991. Given the lack of basic
 procedural safeguards in political trials, most of the
 executions ordered each year in such cases amount to summary
 executions.
 There continued to be credible reports that political prisoners
 are among those executed for criminal offenses, and the
 Government has repeatedly indicated in public statements that
 it equates active opposition to Iran's Islamic revolution with
 terrorism. In addition, the Government continues to carry out
 political executions of its opponents residing abroad. As of
 year's end, the French Government's investigation into the
 August assassination of former Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar
 and his assistant had resulted in a warrant for the arrest of
 an Iranian government official.
 b. Disappearance
 The number of disappearances in 1991 is unknown. The situation
 is complicated by the lack of government information on many
 political prisoners. Many families of executed political
 prisoners reportedly have not been informed officially of their
 relatives' deaths. The Government responded to many of the
 Special Representative's requests for information on specific
 prisoners by denying that it had any judicial record of them.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Accounts of torture in Iran's prisons continued to be received
 in 1991. Persistent reports tell that detainees are tortured
 in detention, and that arbitrary brutality in the treatment of
 convicted prisoners is common. There are also credible
 reports, as noted by the Special Representative, that prisoners
 are frequently held in solitary confinement or denied adequate
 rations or medical care as a way of forcing them to confess.
 Guards have threatened and intimidated family members of
 detainees, and relatives or other prisoners have occasionally
 been forced to watch torture. It is not known if such
 practices occurred in 1991.
 Prisoner piotests against poor prison conditions have
 reportedly been met with beatings, denial of medical care, and,
 in some cases, execution. The Special Representative reported
 that a "Prisoner's Organization" exists to redress
 mistreatment. However, no information is available on its
 activities.
 
 
 1409
 IRAN
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary arrest and detention is a major abuse, but it is not
 known how many cases there may have been in 1991. It is known
 that some persons have been arrested on trumped-up criminal
 charges when their actual "offenses" were political. The lack
 of fair trials and other procedural safeguards encourages such
 practices.
 No judicial determination of the legality of detention exists
 in Iranian law. There is reportedly no legal time limit on
 incommunicado'detention. Suspects are held for questioning at
 local Revolutionary Guard offices or in jails.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are essentially two different court systems. The civil
 courts deal with criminal offenses, and the revolutionary
 courts, established in 1979, try "political" offenses as well
 as cases involving narcotics trafficking and "crimes against
 God."
 By international standards, no trial by a revolutionary court
 can be called fair or public in the usual sense. If the trial
 is staged publicly, it is generally because the prisoner has
 already been forced to confess to a crime. Persons tried by
 the revolutionary courts enjoy virtually no procedural or
 substantive safeguards. The Special Representative reported
 that trials lasting 5 minutes and less are common. He also
 noted in his February 1991 report many examples of the lack of
 basic procedural guarantees, mentioning particularly the
 problem of limited access to a lawyer. The right to a defense.
 counsel is theoretically provided for in the Iranian
 Constitution, but many defendants do not have access to a
 lawyer, are unable to call witnesses on their behalf, and are
 unable to appeal. One observer with 30 years of judicial
 experience told the-Special Representative that lawyers are
 generally not permitted to appear before the revolutionary
 courts and are harassed and intimidated if they insist. Some
 persons have been imprisoned beyond the limit of their
 sentence, and even executed after the formal expiration of
 their prison term.
 There was no evidence in 1991 of judicial reform that would
 bring Iranian courts into compliance with international
 standards. Adoption of a draft law to guarantee legal counsel
 for defendants was blocked by a lack of approval by the Council
 of Guardians. Critics of the law also saw it as flawed because
 it did not guarantee that counsel be provided by a qualified
 attorney-at-law.
 The judicial system is weakened by the fact that revolutionary
 courts can consider cases formally under the jurisdiction of
 the civil and criminal courts. Assignment of cases to regular
 rather than revolutionary courts is haphazard and apparently
 occurs mainly when arrests are made by regular police.
 Revolutionary courts may also overturn the decisions of the
 civilian courts. The review authority of the Supreme Court is
 also limited.
 For common criminal offenses, many elements of the
 prerevolutionary judicial system survive, and the accused often
 have the right to a public trial with benefit of lawyers of
 their own choosing, assuming they can afford the fee. Even
 this judiciary is not fully independent, however. Many of the
 
 
 1410
 IRAN
 former judges were retired after the revolution, and new judges
 were selected. Political and Islamic acceptability is a
 requirement for any government position, including the
 judiciary. Favorable verdicts reportedly can often be
 "purchased" from the judges serving on civil and criminal
 courts and, to a lesser degree, from judges of the
 revolutionary courts. The expert cited above told the Special
 Representative that even in ordinary penal cases lawyers must
 be extremely careful, and mentioned the example of a colleague
 who was indicted after requesting an additional hearing in a
 case. In general, the expert said, the practice of interfering
 with lawyers was becoming worse.
 No reliable estimate is available on the number of political
 prisoners. The Minister of Intelligence and Security reported
 to the press in August that there were 500 prisoners from
 "minigroups," a term generally used to describe political
 opposition groups, as opposed to 1,000 in 1988.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government rejects the Western distinction between a public
 sphere which the State may control and a sphere of private life
 (religion, culture, thought, and private behavior) which the
 State may not properly control. Authorities enter homes,
 wiretap telephones, and open mail, but these activities are
 less common now than they were before 1982.
 Special Revolutionary Guard units and security forces check on
 social activities. Women whose clothing does not completely
 cover the hair and all of the body except hands and face, or
 who wear makeup, are subject to arrest. In the past, men have
 also been required to dress "modestly," eschewing, for example,
 short-sleeved shirts. Enforcement of standards of Islamic
 morality has appeared to vary with the political climate and
 the jurisdiction. There have been periodic crackdowns by the
 Head Office for Combating Unlawful Acts on dress code and moral
 violations. However, there were increasing reports in 1991 of
 instances in which women both individually and collectively
 challenged the authority of the Special Revolutionary Guards to
 impose "proper" dress.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 According to the Constitution, "publications and the press may
 express ideas freely, except when they are contrary to Islamic
 principles or are detrimental to public rights." In practice,
 most publications are controlled by the Government; independent
 publishers run the risk not only of press shutdowns and
 confiscation of publications and equipment but of arrest and
 summary punishment if they are overly critical of the
 Government,
 All books must be submitted to the Ministry of Islamic Guidance
 for review before they may be published. Publishers, authors,
 and printers also engage in substantial self-censorship before
 submitting books to the Ministry in an effort to avoid the
 considerable penalties, including economic losses, incurred
 when books are rejected. Iranian authorities have interpreted
 broadly their right to censorship on religious grounds,
 including official acceptance of the 1991 renewal of the
 religious decree condemning British author Salman Rushdie to
 
 
 1411
 IRAN
 death for his book "Satanic Verses."
 Newspapers, which are usually associated with various
 government factions, reflect a variety of viewpoints.
 Generally, newspapers can and do criticize government policies
 and officials both in their reporting and editorials.
 Newspapers are forbidden, however, to criticize the concept of
 the Islamic republic or to promote ethnic minority rights.
 Nevertheless, some independent publishers out of favor with the
 Government continue to survive, and some books and pamphlets
 critical of the Government are published without reprisal.
 Foreign books, newspapers, and magazines may be imported only
 after they have been reviewed by the Ministry of Islamic
 Guidance.
 All broadcasting facilities are government owned, and the
 content of their broadcasting reflects the political and
 socioreligious ideology of the Government.
 Restrictions on academic freedom continue to be less severe.
 However, course content is still monitored, and there is little
 genuine critical discussion of issues. Informers are said to
 be common on campus and in the classroom. To achieve tenure,
 professors reportedly must cooperate with government
 authorities over a period of years. All textbooks proposed for
 use at the universities are reviewed by government authorities
 to determine their acceptability.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution permits unarmed assemblies and marches
 "provided they do not violate the principles of Islam." In
 practice, the only ones permitted are those sponsored by the
 Government, such as Friday prayers and parades and
 demonstrations on official occasions. Throughout 1991 there
 were reports of unofficial and spontaneous demonstrations
 against the Government, many of them centering on the
 deteriorating economy. These demonstrations were suppressed by
 government forces.
 Article 26 of the Constitution allows the formation of
 political parties, groups, and professional associations, as
 well as Islamic and some minority religious associations,
 provided they do not violate the principles of "freedom,
 sovereignty, [and] national unity" or question Islam or the
 Islamic Republic. In practice, most independent organizations
 have either been banned, co-opted by the Government, or are
 moribund.
 The Freedom Movement, founded in 1961, continues to be harassed
 by Iranian authorities and was declared illegal in 1991.
 According to reliable reports, the Movement's telephones are
 tapped, its mail opened, and its members subjected to
 intimidation. While the Movement participated in the first
 parliamentary election after the revolution, it was prevented
 from doing so in all subsequent elections. Nine members of the
 Movement associated with the Association for the Defense of the
 Freedom and Sovereignty of the Iranian Nation who were arrested
 in May 1990 for their political opposition were finally
 convicted in secret trials in September 1991 and sentenced to
 terms of up to 3 years. Others arrested at the same time were
 released after "confessing" the "wrongness of their stand
 towards the Islamic Republic," according to government
 sources. The Government claimed that the nine who were
 convicted were "charged with participating in gatherings and
 
 
 1412
 IRAN
 collaborating to take actions against the internal and external
 security of the country," and not for having signed an open
 letter of protest to President Rafsanjani.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religion is almost inseparable from government in Iran. The
 President and many other top officials are mullahs (Islamic
 clergymen), as are the Speaker of the Parliament and nearly
 half the parliamentary deputies.
 Approximately 90 percent of Iranians are Shi'a Muslims. Aside
 from slightly over 1 percent who are non-Muslims (Baha'is,
 Christians, Zoroastrians, and Jews), the rest are Sunni
 Muslims. The Sunnis are mostly Kurds, Arabs, Turkomans,
 Baluch, and other ethnic minorities whose political influence
 is very limited. The Constitution declares that "the official
 religion of Iran is Islam and the sect followed is Ja'fari
 Shiism," but it also states that "other Islamic denominations
 shall enjoy complete respect."
 The small Christian, Jewish, and Zoroastrian (the pre-Islamic
 religion of Iran) populations are concentrated mainly in urban
 areas. Their religions are recognized by the Constitution, and
 they elect representatives to seats reserved for them in the
 Parliament. They are permitted to practice their religions, to
 instruct their children, and--although with a great deal of
 disruptive interference--to maintain schools.
 In his February 1991 report, the Special Representative said
 that religious minorities are freely able to practice their
 faith, noting for example that the Armenian Christians operate
 7 active churches in Tehran and 12 in Isfahan, and are able to
 bury their dead in their own cemeteries. He also noted that
 the Armenians, who number about 200,000, are permitted to
 publish a weekly newspaper and to operate a number of cultural
 associations.
 Reports from other sources, however, suggest that while there
 is little overt discrimination against Christians,
 administrative and other official harassment is commonplace.
 In the case of the Chaldean Catholics (numbering about 14,000),
 the Government has reportedly refused to renew the church's
 registration and has, as a result, denied requests to print
 Bibles, construct chapels, or engage in registered charitable
 activities. The Presbyterian church has allegedly suffered
 similar interference from the authorities; while the Interior
 Ministry was said to have allowed elections for church
 officials, it disrupted the meeting at which they took place
 and obstructed the balloting. In addition, it was confirmed
 that a Christian pastor, Reverend Hossein Soodmand, was
 executed in December 1990 in Mashad, apparently on charges of
 apostasy, based on his earlier conversion from Islam to"
 Christianity and proselytizing activity. There were again
 reports in. 1991 that another Christian convert from Islam,
 Mphdi Debadj, has been held in prison since his arrest in 1983
 for apostasy.
 The Government in 1991 continued to discriminate against the
 Baha'i community, Iran's largest non-Muslim minority (300,000
 to 350,000 members). The Baha'i religion is considered a
 "misguided sect" by the authorities and is not officially
 recognized.
 
 
 1413
 
 IRAN
 As it has over the past few years, the Government continued to
 mitigate its repression of individual Baha'is. No Baha'is were
 executed in 1991. A small number of Baha'is were permitted to
 leave the country. The Government continued to return some of
 the property of individual Baha'is that it had previously -
 confiscated, although the amount represents a small fraction of
 the total seized. Most Baha'is are now able to obtain food
 ration booklets. Baha'is are now generally able to bury their
 dead in Baha'i cemeteries, although this remains a problem in a
 number of areas. Baha'i children are now permitted to attend
 grade school and high school. In legal matters, the Government
 has stated that it will protect the "social and legal rights"
 of Baha'is as "normal citizens." However, the actual treatment
 of Baha'is varies depending on the jurisdiction. In his
 February 1991 report, the Special Representative noted that
 "the situation of the Baha'is is moving towards quite broad de
 facto tolerance."
 However, widespread discrimination against the community
 persists. Baha'is continued to face arbitrary arrest and
 detention. A total of 31 Baha'is were detained for various
 lengths of time in the first 6 months of 1991, although the
 number of detainees at any one time was around 10. All
 property of the community, such as places of worship, remains
 confiscated. Baha'i marriages are still not recognized.
 Baha'is generally cannot attend college (the Special
 Representative noted that only four have been admit'ted to
 universities) or be employed on college faculties. Baha'is are
 forbidden to participate in social welfare organizations, and
 they may not teach their faith. Some Baha'is continue to be
 denied public sector (and often private sector) employment on
 account of their religion; in a number of cases ration cards
 have been denied on the same grounds. Thousands of Baha'is
 dismissed from government jobs in the early 1980's receive no
 unemployment benefits and have been required to repay the
 Government for salaries or pensions received from the first day
 of employment. Those unable to do so face severe prison
 sentences. While some Baha'i's have been issued passports, the
 Special Representative reported that the vast majority of such
 applications are denied. The Government continues to attack
 the Baha'i community as a front for political and espionage
 activities and prohibits the community from electing leaders or
 conducting religious activities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Iranians may travel to any part of Iran, although there have
 been restrictions on travel to Kurdish areas at times of heavy
 fighting. Persons may change their place of residence without
 obtaining permission. Over 1 million refugees, the majority of
 them Kurdish and Shi'ite refugees from Iraq, entered Iran in
 1991.
 Males of draft age are not issued exit visas except for
 approved courses of study, and Iranians who are suspect
 politically, such as some retired military officers and
 high-level public officials under the former regime, are not
 able to leave the country. Persons who have not repaid loans
 obtained under the old government also are denied exit visas.
 Reportedly some Iranians, particularly those whose skills are
 in short supply and who were educated at government expense,
 must post bonds to obtain exit visas.. In his February 1991
 report, the Special Representative recounted several instances
 in which passports were denied, sometimes for apparent
 
 
 1414
 IRAN
 political reasons, and on other occasions with no reason
 given. As noted in Section 2.c., most Baha'is are denied
 passports.
 Iranian Jews are permitted to obtain passports and to travel,
 even to Israel, but they are normally denied the multiple-exit
 visas given to most Iranians and must make a new application
 (with another fee) for each planned trip. Permission is not
 mormally granted for all members of a Jewish family to travel
 outside Iran at the same time.
 Iranians are generally able to return to Iran after long
 periods abroad without reprisal. Since the end of the
 Iran-Iraq war, the Government has encouraged the many thousands
 of skilled Iranians living abroad to return to help rebuild the
 country. Of those who have gone back in recent years, a number
 have been able to pursue, through the Iranian judicial system,
 the return of their properties. However, many exiles complain
 that formal legal guarantees of their safety have not yet been
 provided, and, as a result, many remain reluctant to return.
 There are some categories of persons who may be in danger if
 they return to Iran. Some of those with close ties to the
 former regime, draft evaders, and those who departed the
 country illegally face possible arrest upon their return.
 Members or sympathizers with the People's Mojahedin
 .Organization of Iran or the Communist Tudeh Party, both
 opposition groups banned by the Government, are subject to
 imprisonment and torture or even execution should they return.
 Nevertheless, immediate relatives of persons wanted by the
 Government are often able to live in Iran, travel outside, and
 return without undue difficulty.
 Iranian passports have always been stamped "not valid for
 emigration," but the Government does not make a clear
 distinction.between legal residence in another country and
 emigration. According to the regulations, Iranians with a
 legal residence outside Iran may be issued passports and
 advance exit visas by the Iranian embassy, consulate, or
 interests section in their country of residence. Iranians who
 have acquired U.S. citizenship are still considered to be
 -Iranian by the Government unless they have formally renounced
 their Iranian citizenship in accordance with Iranian law.
 There have been many instances in which Iranian authorities
 have confiscated the U.S. passports of dual nationals. There
 are no known instances of the denial of Iranian citizenship to
 Iranians who left Iran, or to those who have remained there.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Iran is ruled by a group of religious leaders (mullahs) and
 their lay associates who share a belief in the legitimacy of a
 theocratic state based on Ayatollah Khomeini's interpretation
 of Shi'a Islam. Citizens are not free to question or to change
 this form of government.
 The revolutionary Government has held elections at fairly
 regular intervals for president, Parliament deputies, members
 of the Assembly of Experts (responsible for choosing the
 Revolutionary Leader's successor), and members of local
 government councils. Elections for the Assembly of Experts and
 parliamentary byelections were last contested in 1990. Voting
 is by universal suffrage of everyone age 15 and older and is by
 secret ballot. All candidates must be approved by the Council
 
 
 1415
 
 IRAN
 of Guardians, however,'and only those meeting the Council's -
 vaguely described political and religious'criteria'may run. In
 practice, only supporters of the theocratic state are
 accepted. Following the Ministry of Interior's announcement in'
 December 1988 that political parties would:be.allowed to form,
 provided they met the Government's religious and political
 criteria, a'few.have been licensed."
 The independence of the Parliament is provided for in the
 Constitution and exists to a large degree in practice. While
 Parliament deputies are typically allied� with Various-powerful'
 political and religious'officials, they may speak and vote
 independently and may shift from one faction to another.
 Vigorous parliamentary debates--normally.coveredext'ensively in
 the press--cover a wide variety of issues. "Harsh ciiticism of'
 government officials is often heard in these debates, and, in
 some cases, laws proposed by the'ekecutive'bianch have been
 voted down.
 The Constitution provides for aCouncil of Guardians comp6sed
 of 12 members: 6 clerics unilaterally appointed by the Leader,
 and 6 lay members well- grounded in Islamic law who are
 nominated by the head of the Jid.icial Council, subj~ct'to th'
 Parliament.'s approval. The Coundil'of, Guardians'must*ceftify
 all bills passed-by the' Parliament'as being in accordance'wilh .
 Islamic law and the Constitution. If bills fail to be
 certified, they are sent back to the Parliament for. revision.
 They cannot become law until pas.sed by the Parliambit and
 certified by the Council.    ,                      � "
 The Council has rejected various important bills and portions "
 of bills pa'ssed by the Parliamet'. including legifatiorf 'oh
 land refdrm,.foreign trade, private ent6rprise, the dress code,'
 and reform of the civil code.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation, of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Iranian organizations that attempt to speak out"on-humaii
 rights, such as'.the Freedbm Moveient  nd"the Associaiibn for *'
 the Protection d Liberties and Human Rights, face severe,
 harassment by 'the Government (see Section 2.b.).' Ig the past,.
 the Government generally has been uncooperative with foreign
 human rights groups, .Whether gOveriiment-sponsoked or  .
 independent, regarding their activities as interference'in the
 country's internal affairs.. Foreign diplbmats stationed ir -'
 Tehran who attempt t6 develop information. about human rights
 abuses face strong interference' from rranian  authorities*.
 In 1990 the Government, for the first time, permitted the U N.
 Special Representative to visit the country and interview both
 opponents and supporters of the Government, including
 high-ranking government officials such as thb head of"the"
 judiciary. Neverztheless, his2 access to viftim's of abuse was
 limited, many potential witnesseb were prevented or"intimidated
 from testifying, and some of those who testified suffered
 reprisals., Government-imposed controls during the Special-
 Representative's visits prevented him from'being able to
 investigate fully all reports of human rights abuses.
 In his February 1991 report,.the Special Representative said
 that the Government had responded favorably in principle to
 several of his suggestions. These included regular visits by
 the International Committee'of 'the Red Cross (ICRC) to prisons
 
 
 1416
 
 IRAN
 throughout the country to examine conditions and to look into
 the situation of political prisoners; the possibility of the
 U.N.- Center for-Human Rights in Geneva providing technical
 assistance "to Iran; development of. a program to identify
 inconsistencies betieen Islamic law and international law to
 help bring the Iranian system more in linewith accepted  .
 international-standards of human rights; and consideration, of
 humanitarian requests submitted by the Special Representative.
 At the United Nations, however, Iran continued its efforts to
 end, or at least restrict, the-Special Represintative's
 mandate. 'The.Government finally agreed late in 1991 to allow
 the Special Ropresentative.to visit in December.
 In November the .Government signed .an agreement with the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) providing for
 regular ICRC-visits to Iranian'detention facilities to register
 prisoners and monitor their treatment. (Pior to this, the
 ICRC already was visiting Iraqi prisoners-of-war held by
 Iran.) This agreement provided for all the normal ICRC
 conditions such As privacy of interviews and repeat visits. As
 of the end .of the-year, visits had not yet begun.
 Iran held an international seminar on international and Islamic
 law regarding human rights in September, at which the main
 theme was that Iran should be judged bk "Islamic" rather than
 Western human rights'principles..
 --The Government indicated its willingness in principle to
 receive an official visit from Middle East Watch, a New
 York-based human rights monitoring group, to investigate
 conditions inside Iran, but the visit did not take place in
 1991. In'May, however, the Government did allow a separate,
 unscheduled mission to, Iran by Middle East Watch, as well as
 one by Amnesty International, to interview Kurdish and Shi'ite
 refugees from Iraq.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Women traditionally have faced discrimination in Iranian
 society, and this discrimination has increased since the
 revolution.. Ultraconservative dress; entirely hiding the hair
 and all of the body except the face and hands, is a requirement*
 for all women, regardless of their religion, national origin,
 or citizenship. In the past, women have been harassed,
 detained, or physically attacked if they appeared in public in
 clothing that official or self-appointed guardians of public
 morality deemed insufficiently modest. Enforcement of these -
 rules has varied considerably since Ayatollah Khomeini's death
 .in 1989, and, as noted in Section l.f., there was evidence in
 1991 of growing resistance by women to the authority of the
 Special Revolutionary Guards to impose a dress code.
 Although violence against women is known to occur in Iran,
 little is known about its extent. Abuse within the family is
 considered a.private matter in this conservative society and is
 seldom discussed publicly. There are no official statistics on
 the subject. There are persistent and credible reports of the
 torture and execution of women detainees, some of whom were
 allegedly raped before execution; it is not known if any such
 incidents occurred in 1991.
 Under legislation passed in 1983, women have the right to
 divorce their husbands, and regulations promulgated in 1984
 substantially broadened to 12 the number of grounds for which a
 
 
 1417
 IRAN
 woman may seek divorce. A husband may obtain a divorce without
 having to state a reason or go to court.
 The Christian, Jewish, Zoroastrian, and Baha'i minorities
 suffer varying degrees of officially sanctioned discrimination
 in a number of areas, particularly with respect to employment,
 education, and public accommodations. Muslims who have
 converted to Christianity are similarly discriminated against,
 and under Shari'a (Islamic) law the ultimate penalty for
 apostasy is execution. One requirement of university admission
 is passing a test on Islamic theology, which has the effect of
 excluding most religious minorities from higher education.
 Applicants for public sector employment are similarly screened
 for adherence to standards of Islamic orthodoxy, with much the
 same effect. There have also been reports that religious
 minorities have suffered discrimination in the legal system,
 such as receiving lower awards in injury and death lawsuits,
 and of receiving heavier punishments than those imposed on
 Muslims. Although Sunnis have encountered religious
 discrimination on the local level, the Government has tried to
 reduce Shi'a-Sunni antagonism.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 There are no real labor unions. A national organization known
 as the "House of Labor," founded in 1982 as the labor branch of
 the now defunct Islamic Republican Party, is the only
 authorized national labor organization. It works closely with
 the Islamic societies and Islamic labor councils set up in most
 Iranian factories. The House of Labor is headed by Hossein
 Kamali, the Minister of Labor; as such, it is largely a conduit
 of government influence and control, not a trade union founded
 by workers to represent their interests. The officially
 sanctioned Islamic labor councils also are instruments of
 government control and not bodies created and controlled by
 workers to advance their own interests, although they have
 frequently been able to block layoffs or the firing of workers.
 There is also a system of "guild unions," which operates on a
 regional basis. These guild unions issue vocational licenses,
 fund financial cooperatives to assist members, and help workers
 to find jobs. The guild unions operate with the cooperation of
 the Government.
 No information is available on the right of workers in Iran to
 strike. It is unlikely that the Government would tolerate any
 strike deemed to be at odds with its economic and labor
 policies. There were reports, however, in 1991 of sporadic,
 politically motivated strikes of short duration, sparked
 chiefly by economic conditions in the country.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 In practice, the right of workers to organize independently and
 bargain collectively is extremely limited. No information is
 available on the mechanism used to set wages.
 It is not known whether labor legislation and practice in the
 export processing zones differ in any significant respect from
 the law and practice in the rest of the country.

 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Section 273 of the Iranian Penal Code provides that any person
 who does not have definite means of subsistence and who,
 through laziness or negligence, does not look for work may be
 obliged by the Government to take suitable employment. This
 provision has been frequently criticized by the Committee of
 Experts (COE) of the International Labor Organization (ILO) as
 contravening ILO Convention 29 on forced labor. In its 1990
 report, the COE noted an indication by the Government in its
 latest report to the Committee that Section 273 had been
 abolished and replaced, for a trial period, by a new provision
 approved by the Parliament. The Government, according to the
 COE, stated that the new provision was not incompatible with
 Convention 29 and promised to provide a copy after the
 provision was translated. The COE noted that the Government
 had indicated in its 1977 report that similar regulations
 concerning unemployed persons and vagrants had been repealed
 but had not yet complied with the Committee's request for a
 copy of the repealing legislation.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Iranian labor law, which exempts agriculture, domestic service,
 family businesses, and, to some extent, other small businesses,
 forbids employment of minors under 12 years and places special
 restrictions on the employment of minors under 18. In
 addition, women and minors may not be used for hard labor or,
 in general, for night work. The extent to which these
 regulations are-enforced is not known.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The labor law establishes a 6-day workweek of 48 hours maximum
 (except for overtime at premium rates), with 1 day of rest
 (normally Friday) per week as well as at least 12 days per year
 of leave with pay and a number of paid public holidays. There
 are also legal provisions with respect to minimum wages and
 health and safety in workplaces. Further information on these
 laws and the amount and adequacy of the minimum wage is not
 available.
 Given the large segments of the economy exempted from the labor
 law, the State's still unresolved administrative
 disorganization resulting from the revolution, the effects of
 the war with Iraq, and the general lack of effective labor
 unions, it is unclear to what extent the provisions of Iran's
 labor law affect most of the labor force.
 The ILO has long been concerned with official discrimination in
 -employment against members of the Baha'i religion. In its 1991
 report, the ILO's COE recounted the 1990 ILO debates about
 discrimination in employment against Baha'is, and asked the
 Government to provide additional clarification of the current
 situation.and of the Government's claims that it is taking
 steps to bring about compliance with ILO Convention 111 barring
 discrimination in employment, which has been the primary focus
 of complaints against Iran at the ILO for its treatment of
 Baha'is (see also Section 5).
