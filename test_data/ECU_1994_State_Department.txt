 ECUADOR
 Ecuador is a constitutional republic with a president and a 77-member unicam-
 eral legislature chosen in free elections. The 1994 midterm elections left President
 Sixto Duran Ballen's governing coalition only nine seats in the National Assembly.
 Members of the Supreme Court preside over a judiciary that is constitutionally inde-
 pendent but susceptible to outside pressure. The Assembly has sweeping powers to
 question and censure cabinet ministers; such censure results in automatic dismissal
 of the minister in question. This is often used as a political tool by opposition politi-
 calparties.
 e Ecuadorian military has significant autonomy, reinforced by guaranteed ac-
 cess to revenues from the nation's oil exports, as well as from civil aviation, ship-
 ping, and other economic activities. The military has maintained a low profile in do-
 mestic politics since the return to constitutional rule in 1979. The National Police,
 responsible for domestic law enforcement and maintenance of internal order, falls
 under the civilian Ministry of Government and Police. There continued to be credi-
 ble allegations of human rights abuses by the police and in some isolated cases the
 military.
 The economy is based on private enterprise, although there continued to be heavy
 government involvement in key sectors such as petroleum, utilities, and aviation.
 Inflation was about 25 percent in 1994, though it continued a steady downward
 trend begun in 1992. Most Ecuadorians are employed in the urban informal sector
 or as rural agricultural workers; rural poverty is extensive, and underemployment
 is high.
 The most fundamental human rights abuse stems from shortcomings in the politi-
 cized legal and judicial system. People are subject to arbitrary arrest; once incarcer-
 ated, they may walt years before coming to trial unless they resort to paying bribes.
 Other human rights abuses included instances of extrajudicial killings; torture and
 other mistreatment of prisoners and detainees by the police; government failure to
 prosecute and punish human rights abusers; and pervasive discrimination against
 women, blacks, and indigenous people. Despite these continuing problems, the Gov-
 ernment did make significant progress toward prosecuting those responsible for two
 longstanding human rights cases in 1994.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings in 1994. The police continued to be responsible for extrajudicial
 killings, although the number of such reports dropped noticeably. The police often
 acted with impunity in such cases, because disciplinary action is the responsibility
 of the poliee itself. Although special police courts usually try cases involving police
 officers as defendants, the Government in some recent cases withdrew this right and
 tried officers in civil courts.
 The Catholic Church-based Ecumenical Committee for Human Rights (CEDHU)
 reported a total of nine extrajudicial killings, including two individuals who died
 during an indigenous protest, but with no involvement by security forces (see Sec-
 tions 2.a. and 5). Two deaths involved persons who died in police custody while
 being interrogated. A stray bullet killed one person during a military anticrime
 sweep in the city of Esmeraldas.
 For example, CEDHU reported that members of Interpol, part of the National Po-
 lice, arrested Angel Vega at his home on May 5. Neighbors reported that police beat
 him while he was detained. Later in the evening, the police delivered Vega's body
 to the morgue of the Isidro Ayora hospital in Loja without explanation. His body
 showed signs of scrapes, bruises, and burns. The authorities took no action against
 
 
 385
 the Interpol officers. Another extrajudicial killing occurred when police killed a
 strng sugar refinery worker. There was no investigation of this case.
 After long   ay,   ere was progress toward prosecution of those responsible for
 two of the principal human rights cases in Ecuador-the 1988 disappearance and
 presumed deaths of the Restrepo brothers and the 1985 disappearance and murder
 of Consuelo Benavides. In the case of the Restrepo bothers, the president of the Su-
 preme Court made a series of determinations on the case beginning in May when
 he declared two lower ranking police officials as authors of the muders, three mid-
 level officers as accomplices, and General Gilberto Molina (then the police com-
 mander), and one other officer as involved in a coverup. On November 15, the presi-
 dent of the Supreme Court gave these seven defendants the 7mxmum sentences for
 the crimes for which they were charged. Appeals were expected.
 In the Benavides case, after a long internal investigation which strongly impli-
 cated Navy Commander Fausto Moein the murder, in August the Mindter of
 Defense ordered that Morales begin to report to his superiors on a weekly basis.
 When Morales failed to appear at the second such meeting, the authorities sent
 military police to pick him up and jail him. The Minister of Defense annunced that
 the investigation of the case had uncovere enough evidence of Morales' guilt that
 the Government would withdraw his traditional right to a military court trial and
 turn him over to a civilian court for prosecution. By the end of the year, the Su-
 preNme Court's penal chamber had moved into the final stages of the case, and a do-
 ciion was expected soon.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the law prohibits torture and similar forms of intimidation and punish-
 ment, police continued to p hysically mistreat suspects and prisoners, usually with
 impunity. CEDHU regularly published detailed reports on suspects claiming that
 the police had tortured them, frequently naming police officials alleged to be respon-
 sible, and often including phmtographs of the victims with their wounds. In mast
 cases, the police appeare to have abused such persons during investigations con-
 cerming ordinary street crime. According to EDH, the victims reported that the
 police  at them, burned them with cigarettes, or threatened them psychologically.
 The Government has never resnded to CEDHU's reports.
 The law permits police or military courts to try police officers and members of the
 armed forces in closed sessions. The police court in particular does not announce
 verdicts or punishments, if any, creating the str son g impe sn that the palice are
 immune from prosecution. In some high-profile cases (as in the Consuelo Benavides
 case and the Restrepo case noted in Section La.), the civilian authorities may decide
 to remand a case ta civil court.
 The most significant case of alleged mistreatment of prisoners involved the sus-
 pects arrested by the military following a FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Co-
 lombia)gurrilla ambush along the Colombian border. The military picked up 11 al-
 lege FRC members or supporters, 10 Colombians and 1 Ecuadrian, in a sweep
 following an ambush in which 11 soldiers and police officers died. All but two of the
 suspects signed confessions admitting to taking part in the ambush. Two, however,
 later recanted saying that they had signed the confessions as a result of torture.
 Others also claimed the military tortured them but did not recant their confessions.
 The one female prisoner said she was raped. Several human rights organizations
 examined the prisoners and confirmed that they had. a varie.y of inj.uries ranging
 from bruises and abrasions to a broken arm. The military said the injuries were a
 result of being handcuffed and of traveling through the jungle on foot. According to
 some human     hts observers who were ciose to the case, medical examinations of
 the suspects in~cated that the~ iuries were consistent with either expl] anation, and
 that there was no conclusive evidence of torture. In August the authorities released
 4 of the 11 for lack of evidence, including the 2 who had never confessed and the
 2 who had recanted.
 Conditions in Ecuador's detention centers generally continued to be poor. Prisons
 in the tropical coastal areas tend to be worse than those in the temperate highlands.
 Overcrowding is a chronic problem, although conditions are notably better in the
 women's prison in Quite than in other facilities. There are no separate facilities for
 hard-cre or dangerous criminals, nor are rete effective rehabiitation pregrams.
 Indigenous organizatins ong tinued to charge that private  ar tary groups
 target indigenous people and other peasants for violent and lethal reprisals during
 illegal land invasions and other squatter demonstrations. However, there were no
 substantiated reports of any serious incidents between the paramilitary groups and
 squatters in 1994. Modifications made in the agrarian land reform law changed the
 former legal framework that had prompted many landowners to form their own pri-
 
 
 vate armed security units to protect their land holdings. Under the new law, civil
 courts settle land disputes.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution and the Penal Code
 provide that no one may be deprived of liberty without a written order from a gov-
 ernmental authority, but the authorities often violated these legal protections
 against arbitrary arrest or detention. By law the authorities must issue specific
 written orders within 24 hours of detention-even in cases in which a suspect is
 caught in the act of committing a crime-and must charge the suspect with a spe-
 cific criminal offense within 48 hours of arrest. All detained persons have the right
 to a review of the legality of their detention within 48 hours of arrest, a review that
 is supposed to be carried out by the senior elected official (usually the mayor) of
 the locality in which the suspect is held. Regardless of the legality of a detention,
 the law requires a court order in order to release a prisoner. In some cases, detain-
 ees unaware of this, or who do not have the funds to hire a lawyer, may remain
 in prison for an extended period before being released. Bail is not generally avail-
 able. Families of detainees sometimes intervene in an attempt to secure the pris-
 oner's freedom through illegal means.
 Human rights organizations reported occasional cases of incommunicado deten-
 tion, although the law prohibits this practice. Despite provisions of the Penal Code,
 the police often detained suspects without the required written order. Even when
 an order was obtained, those charged with determining the validity of detention
 often allowed frivolous charges to be brought, either because of overwork or because
 bribes were paid by the accuser. In many instances, the system was used as a
 means of harassment in civil cases in which one party sought to have the other ar-
 rested on criminal charges. The authorities frequently detained suspects longer than
 24 hours before orders were signed and charged few within 48 hours of arrest. Pre-
 ventive detention up to and including trial is legal under certain circumstances.
 The Government does not use exile as a method of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The regular court system tries most non-military
 defendants, although some indigenous groups try members privately for violations
 of tribal rules. Despite efforts begun in 1992 to depoliticize and modernize the court
 system, the judiciary continues to operate slowly and inconsistently. Judges report-
 edly rendered decisions more quickly or more slowly depending on political pressure
 or the payment of bribes. However, the norm is for lengthy periods before cases
 come to the courts (see below).
 The law provides for internationally accepted due process rights for criminal de-
 fendants, but the authorities often did not observe these rights in practice. By law,
 the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty, and defendants have the right
 to a public trial, defense attorneys, and appeal. They may present evidence but have
 the privilege not to testify against themselves, and they may confront and cross-ex-
 amine witnesses. Although a public defender system exists, in practice there are rel-
 atively few attorneys available to defend the large number of indigent suspects.
 Trial is supposedt be i within 15 to 60 days of the initial arrest, but in prac-
 tice, initiation of the trial phase can take years. An end-of-year census of the peni-
 tentiary system found that only 29 percent of the 9,227 prisoners had been convicted
 of a crime. Indigenous people and other minorities are disproportionately affected
 by these delays as they are more likely to be poor and unable to buy their way out
 of pretrial detention. However, there was no evidence of a systematic effort to dis-
 criminate against women or minorities.
 There were no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires police to have a warrant to enter a private home or business, except in the
 case of hot pursuit. The police generally respect the sanctity of private homes and
 correspondence. Police surveillance is permitted, but the Constitution prohibits wire-
 tapping, and the results of a wiretap are not admissible as evidence in court.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 and the authorities generally respected this provision in practice, but with some no-
 table exceptions. All of the major media organs--television, newspapers, and radio-
 are in local private hands except for two government-owned radio stations. (Foreign
 investment in media is prohibited.) However, using a law (promulgated by the last
 military regime) that requires the media to give the Government free space or air
 time, the Government can and does require television and radio to broadcast govern-
 ment-produced programs featuring the President and other top administration offi-
 cials. It also requires newspapers to carry a minimum amount of news prepared by
 the National Secretariat of Social Communications. The media and opposition politi-
 
 
 387
 cal figures often criticized the Government's use of the media for its own political
 ends.
 In June, following a protest by indigenous people against an agrarian reform law,
 troops took over several radio stations in heavily indigenous areas. The Government
 accused the stations of inciting the protest which resulted in the deaths of two per-
 sons in altercations between striking indigenous people and other civilians. The
 Government allowed the stations back on the air after they agreed not to broadcast
 news or other information related to the protest. The Government said the public
 scrvice stations had violated their charters by broadcasting news reports. (Public
 service stations are prohibited from airing news opinion, or commercial messages.)
 The media represent a wide range of political views and often criticize the Gov-
 ernment. However, some degree of self-censorship in the print media occurs, par-
 ticularly with respect to politically sensitive issues or stories about the military and
 its related industries. The media also willingly censored issues considered to be in
 the realm of national security when the Government so requested.
 The Government does not interfere in issues involving academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights of free assembly and association for peaceful purposes. These rights are
 generally respected in practice. Public rallies require prior government permits,
 which are generally granted, although exceptions exist. Numerous political dem-
 onstrations took place in the capital and the outlying regions, including a major na-
 tional protest by indigenous groups. In general the security forces intervened in
 demonstrations only when there was violence against bystanders or property. Al-
 though the authorities usually showed restraint in the use of force, riot police in
 two instances fired tear gas canisters at protesters, causing some serious injuries.
 Following the court decisions in the Restrepo case (see Section l.a.), the Govern-
 ment continued to refuse to renew a permit for the Restrepo family to hold its week-
 ly protest in the main plaza in front of the presidential palace. However, the weekly
 demonstrations continued because the boys' father believed the convictions should
 have included higher government officials.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution prohibits discrimination for religious
 reasons, and citizens are free to practice the religion of their choice. Numerous for-
 eign-based religious orders and missionary groups are active.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution assures the right of all citizens to travel freely
 throughout the country, to choose their place of residence, and to depart from and
 return to Ecuador. These rights are respected in practice.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Since the return to civilian rule in 1979, citizens have actively exercised their
 right to change their national and local governments. Free and fair elections re-
 sulted in the peaceful transfer of power to parties of opposing views in presidential
 elections every 4 years. There are 15 legally registered political parties, spanning
 the ideological spectrum, 13 of which are represented in Congress. The 1992 na-
 tional elections mesulted in the peaceful transfer of power from a center-left govern-
 ment to a center-right government, with a realignment of power within the National
 Assembly as well.
 Voting is mandatory for literate citizens over the age of 18 and voluntary for illit-
 erate citizens. The Constitution bars members of the clergy from election to Con-
 gress, the presidency, or vice presidency. Candidates must belong to one of the rec-
 ognized parties and may not run as independents.
 Traditional elites tend to be self-perpetuating, and blacks, indigenous people and
 women continued to be almost completely absent from high positions in government,
 although no specific laws or plicis prevent women or minorities from attaining
 leadership positions. Grassroots community groups, particularly among the indige-
 nous population, were increasingly successful-in pressuring the central Government
 to assist them. Several traditional political parties began to court the rural indige-
 nous vote, and at least one, the Maoist Popular Democratic Movement, did unex-
 pectedly well in the May congressional elections because of support it received in
 heavily indigenous areas.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Domestic human rights groups such as CEDHU and the regional Latin American
 Human Rights Association (ALDHU) are independent and actively monitor human
 rights issues. These groups, particularly CEDHU, have been outspoken in their crit-
 icism of the Governments record on specific cases. Nevertheless, the Government
 
 
 388
 contracted with ALDHU to provide human rights training to the military and the
 police.
 International human rights organizations operate without hindrance in Ecuador.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, religion, sex, or social
 status. However, women, blacks, and indigenous people face significant discrimina-
 tion.
 Women.-Discrimination against women is pervasive in Ecuadorian society, par-
 ticularly with respect to educational and economic opportunity in the lower eco-
 nomic strata. The increasingly active women's movement blames culture and tradi-
 tion for inhibiting achievement of full equality for women. There are fewer women
 in the professions or working as skilled laborers than men, and salary discrimina-
 tion against women is common. Although the law prohibits violence against women,
 including within marriage, it is a widespread practice. Many rapes go unreported
 because of the victims' reluctance to confront the perpetrator. An individual alone
 may not swear out a complaint against a spouse or companion, but must have a
 third party do so. While some communities have established centers for counseling
 and legal support of abused women, the Government only began to address this
 question with the formation of the "Comisaria de la Mujer," or Women's Bureau,
 which initiated work in early November. Still, while the Comisaria can accept com-
 plaints about abuse from women, it has no authority to act on them.
 Children.-The Government is committed in principle to the welfare of children
 but has not taken effective steps to promote it. Government resources to assist chil-
 dren have traditionally been limited, though in October it instituted a program to
 care for the children of the working poor called "Operation Child Rescue." Several
 private organizations are very active in programs to assist street children, and the
 U.N. Children's Fund also runs a program in conjunction with the Central Bank.
 Especially in urban areas, the children of the poor often experience severe hard-
 ships. It is common to see children as young as 5 or 6 years of age selling news-
 papers or candy on the street to support themselves or to augment the family in-
 come. There also are instances of prostitution by girls under 18 in urban areas. In
 rural areas, young children often must leave school at an early age to help out on
 the family's plot of land.
 Indigenous People.-While at least 85 percent of all Ecuadorians claim some in-
 digenous heritage, culturally indigenous people make up about 25 to 30 percent of
 the total population. The vast majority of these people live in rural areas and most
 live in varying degrees of poverty. Land is scarce in the more heavily populated
 highland areas. High infant mortality, malnutrition, and epidemic disease are com-
 mon, and potable water and electricity too often unavailable. The rural education
 system is seriously deficient.
 Indigenous people enjoy the same civil and political rights as other citizens and
 also have several special privileges designed to allow them to manage their own af-
 fairs within their own communities. This is especially true in the Amazon area,
 where indigenous groups have claim to specific land areas. Amazon indigenous
 groups also have begun to play an active role in the decisionmaking process in the
 use of their lands for oil exploration and production through direct pressure on the
 Government and through their contacts with foreign nongovernmental organiza-
 tions. Many indigenous groups participated actively with the Ministry of Education
 in the development of the bilingual education program used in rural public schools.
 Indigenous leaders argue that the Government does not take their interests into
 consideration when making national policy and that the only way to get attention
 is through active protests. In one such action in June to express opposition to a
 newly passed agrarian reform law, indigenous groups blocked roads in the highland
 region of the country, isolating cities from other regions and from food-producing
 areas for almost 2 weeks. During confrontations in the protest, persons affected by
 the stoppage of commerce killed two indigenous people. When the Government fi-
 nally announced a military mobilization to end the protest, the authorities restored
 peace rapidly and without further bloodshed. As a result of the protest, the Presi-
 dent named a commission with significant indigenous participation to redraft the
 Agarian Reform Law. Conges then quickly passed a modified reform law.
 ational /Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The population of the rural, northern coastal
 area includes large numbers of black citizens. They suffer widespread poverty and
 pervasive discrimination, particularly with regard to educational and economic op-
 portunity. There were no special government efforts to address these problems.
 
 
 389
 People With Disabilities.-There are no laws to guarantee disabled people access
 to public buildings or services, nor are they provided any other special government
 assistance.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and Labor Code provide most
 workers the right to form trade unions. However, public security and military offi-
 cials and public sector employees in nonrevenue earning entities are not free to form
 trade unions. The 1991 labor code reforms raised the number of workers required
 for an establishment to be unionized from 15 to 30, which the International Labor
 .Oranization (ILO) Committee on Freedom of Association (CFA) considered too
 stringent a limitation at the plant workers council level.
 While employees of stated-owned organizations erooy rights similar to those of the
 private sector, the law technically prevents the majority of pblic sector employees
 from joining unions or exercising ollective bargaining rights. Nevertheless, most
 pubic emp~yees maintain membership in some labor organization, and there are
 frequent illegal" strikes. Despite official threats, the Government rarely takes ac-
 tion against striking public workers.
 Approximately 8 to 9 percent of the work force is organized. There are four large
 labor centrals or confederations, three of which maintain international affiliation.
 None of the main labor centrals is firmly connected to any one political party, and
 there are no ties between the Government and any labor union.
 There are few restrictions on workers' right to strike, although a 20-day cooling-
 off period is required before declaring a strike. The 1991 labor code revisions limit
 solidarity strikes or boycotts to 3 days, provided that they are a pproved by the
 Labor Ministry. In a legal strike, workers may take possession of the factory or
 workplace, thus ending production at the site, and receive police protection during
 the takeover. The employer must pay all salaries and benefits during a legal strie;
 the Labor Code protects strikers and their leaders from retaliation. The only signifi-
 cant strike in 1994 was at the Amtra sugar refinery. Workers closed down the plant
 to protest the sale of the company as part of the Government's modernizationpro-
 gram. As noted in Section l.a., plice klled one Aztra worker during street dem-
 onstrations related to the strike.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Ecuador has a highly seq-
 mented labor market with a minority of workers in skilled, usually unionized, posi-
 tions in state-run enterprises or in medium to large industries. Most of the economi-
 cally active population is employed in either the agricultural sector or the urban in-
 formal sector, the vast majority of these workers are not organized. The Labor Code
 requires that all private employers with 30 or mere workers belonging to a union
 must negotiate collectively when the union so requests.
 The new labor law streamlined the bargaining process in state enterprises by re-
 .quiring workers to be represented by one labor union only. It prohibits discrimina-
 tion against unions and requires that employers provide space for union activities
 upon the union's request. The law does not permit employers to dismiss a worker
 without the express permission of the  n  y of Labor, rulings which are not sub-
 ject to judicial review. If the Ministry of Labor rules a dismissal as unjustified, it
 can require the employer to pay large indemnities or separation payments to the
 worker, although the reforms set a cap on such payments. The Labor Code provides
 for resolution of labor conflicts through an arbitration and conciliation board com-
 prised of one representative of the Ministry of Labor, two from the union, and two
 representatives of management.
 The Maquila (in bond) Law passed in 1990 permits the hiring of temporary work-
 ers for the maquila industries only. While there is no express prohibition on associa-
 tion rights in the Maquila Law, in practice it is difficult to organize temporary em-
 ployees on short-term contracts. Because the labor law does not consider the concept
 of the temporary worker, they do not enjoy the level of protection offered by the
 Labor Code. The maquila system allows a company and its property to become an
 export processing zone wherever it is located. Many such "zones" have thus been
 established; most are dedicated to textiles and fish processing.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution and the Labor
 Code prohibit compulsory labor and there were no reports of it.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits persons less
 than 14 years old from working, except in special circumstances such as apprentice-
 ships. It requires those between the ages of 14 and 18 to have the permission of
 their parent or guardian to work. The law prohibits children between the ages of
 15 and 18 from working more than 7 hours per day or 35 hours per week, and it
 restricts children below the age of 15 to a maximum of 6 hours per day and 30
 hours per week. In practice, the Ministry of Labor is seriously lax in enforcement
 
 
 390
 of child labor laws. In rural areas many children attend school only sporadically
 after about 10 years of age in order to contribute to household income as farm labor-
 ers. In the city many children under age 14 work in family-owned "businesses in
 the informal sector, shining shoes, collecting and recycling garbage, or as street ped-
 dlers.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Ministry of Labor has the principal role
 in enforcing labor laws and carries this out with a corps of labor inspectors who are
 active in all 21 provinces. The Labor Code provides for a 40-hour workweek a 15-
 day annual vacation, a minimum wage, and other variable employer-provided bene-
 fits, such as uniforms and training opportunities.
 The Ministry of Labor sets the minimum wage every 6 months in consultation
 with the Commission on Salaries, but Congress may also adjust it. Enforced by the
 Ministry of Labor, the basic minimum wage is not adequate to provide a decent
 standard of living for a worker and family. As of December, the minimum wage plus
 mandated bonuses provided a gross monthly compensation of approxiately $120.50
 (277,334 sucres.  os organized workers in sae industries and formal sector pri-
 vate enterprises earned substantially more than the minimum wage and also re-
 ceived significant other benefits through collective bargaining agreements. The great
 majority of Ecuadorian labor, however works in the large informal sector without
 recourse to the minimum wage or legally mandated benefits.
 The Labor Code also provides for general protection of workers' health and safety
 on the job. A worker may not leave the workplace of his own volition, even if there
 is a hazardous situation. The worker is allowed to request that an inspector from
 the Ministry of Labor come to the workplace and confirm the hazard; that inspector
 may then close down the workplace. The Government enforces health and safety
 standards and regulations through the Social Security Institute. In the formal sec-
 tor, occupational health and safety is not a major problem. However, there are no
 specific regulations governing health and safety standards in the agricultural sector
 and, in practice, there is no enforcement of safety rules in the small mines which
 make up the vast majority of the mining sector.
