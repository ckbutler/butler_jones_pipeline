 KAMPUCHEA
 The central features of human rights in Kampuchea are the
 continuing violation by Vietnam (SRV) of the Khmer nation's
 and people's right to national integrity and sovereignty,
 the repressive policies of both the Heng Samrin and Pol Pot
 contenders for power, and the thin margin of survival for
 most Khmer. 180,000 Vietnamese troops continue to occupy
 and administer Kampuchea three years after the invasion and
 overthrow of the brutally oppressive Pol Pot Democratic
 Kampuchea (DK) regime. Although the People's Republic of
 Kampuchea (PRK) regime in June promulgated a constitution
 which claims to "recognize and respect" human rights and
 purports to set up a judicial system, Vietnamese forces and
 administrators stand above the law with respect to any and
 all human rights for the Khmer people. The Hanoi-controlled
 Heng Samrin administration has facilitated some resuscita-
 tion of normal Kampuchean life. Basic food and medical
 needs go first to Khmer who work directly within or around
 the administration Heng Samrin and his Vietnamese sponsors
 are attempting to construct.
 In 1981, ordinary Khmer slowly began to benefit from large-
 scale international relief donated to Kampuchea. The Khmer
 people are still caught between their fears of a restoration
 to power by the Pol Pot regime, the dangers of associating
 or not associating with the fledgling Heng Samrin administra-
 tion, and their resentment over subjugation by their tradi-
 tional enemy, the Vietnamese. In the regions controlled by
 the People's Republic of Kampuchea, there have been improve-
 ments, if circumscribed, in education, cultural, and reli-
 gious activities. The Khmer people, largely on their own
 initiative, have begun reconstruction of a rudimentary
 economy, based on subsistance agriculture and on trading of
 commodities from the Thai-Kampuchean border and from
 international relief. There has been no real institutional
 progress which promises any meaningful relief from Vietnamese
 violation of basic Khmer human rights. Government repression,
 restrictions, and surveillance are increasing as resistance
 to the regime grows. Convincing evidence now exists that
 the regime may be employing lethal chemical/biological
 agents against groups along the Thai-Kampuchean border who
 continue to resist its authority. The continuing failure of
 the regime to provide for basic human rights has led to a
 small, but steady flow of refugees to the Thai border.
 In late 1979, the DK discarded some of its state institutions,
 and the role of some major personalities shifted. Only
 limited information is available on the DK administration in
 1981. This limited information suggests that the DK regime
 has abandoned its practice of summary executions, widespread
 from 1975 to 1978, for all but the most serious offenses,
 and it has undertaken a propaganda campaign to convince the
 Khmer that it has given up many of its other objectionable
 human rights practices. These moves have not eased the
 profound alienation between the Democratic Kampuchea regime
 and most of the population. Information on the non-communist
 areas of control is not adequate for discussion. These
 areas ate relatively small, with the bulk of the population
 of about 100,000 resident in camps at Nong Chan or Nong
 Samet. International agencies supply an adequ4.te diet;
 security is fair, subject to undisciplined soldiers and
 taxes of the camp leaderships. Conditions have improved
 over the past year, as troop discipline increases. The
 resistance movement which loosely controls these camps, the
 Khmer People's National Liberation Front, promises further
 improvements, but its control is not adequate to produce
 
 
 612
 more than slow progress. Small-scale conflict increased
 throughout most of central and western Kampuchea in the
 first six months of 1981.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 The PRK promulgated a constitution in June which purports to
 set up a judicial system of courts and military tribunals
 and to provide the accused the right to defense. It is too
 early to tell whether the structures and processes called
 for in the new constitution have been implemented in a way
 that provides meaningful legal protection or recourse for
 the integrity of the person. In DK areas, DK radio broadcast
 a long series of legal principles in early 1981, including a
 law which "prohibits" the killing of Kampucheans, "establishes"
 a judicial mechanism to examine and prosecute violators of
 the law, and states the punishments for violations. These
 legal principles apparently exist only on paper and provide
 no legal protection or recourse to Khmer living under DK
 authority.
 a. Torture
 Knowledgeable Khmer citizens and Khmer refugees, based on
 their contacts with inmates or from personal experience, now
 report only rare instances of torture in areas of Kampuchea
 controlled by either the DK or the PRK.
 b. Cruel, inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Summary executions were widespread by the DK regime from
 1975 to 1978. Very limited information available in 1981
 suggests that such executions still occur for serious
 offenses, but that they no longer seem the rule. DK soldiers
 reportedly massacred a number of civilian Vietnamese refugees
 near the Thai border in June. There are no recent reports
 of summary executions by PRK authorities.
 According to first-hand reports, in the central prison in
 Phnom Penh there is no provision of medical care or medicines,
 clothing or soap, and there are cases of malnutrition and
 malnutrition-related deaths among the prisoners. Some
 prisoners are reportedly kept in tiny cells in total isola-
 tion and darkness, and lose the ability to walk after several
 months. Some inmates allegedly have been beaten to death.
 c. Disappearances
 People reportedly "disappear" in areas controlled by both
 the DK and PRK. In the latter, most are thought to be
 imprisoned. Families are unable to account for relatives
 who "disappear" in the DK or PRK penal system.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Although no adequate information is available, there are
 reports that several thousand Khmer are currently held as
 political prisoners in Phnom Penh by PRK authorities or in
 Kompong Cham by Vietnamese authorities. There are also
 reports of frequent-arrests by PRK and Vietnamese authorities
 in rural areas of those suspected of cooperating with
 resistance forces. No numerical information is available on
 those arrested by the DK, although arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment were common when they ruled in Phnom Penh.
 Amnesty International Report 1981 expresses concern about
 reports of political imprisonment and of political trials in
 
 
 613
 the PRK, and the belief that some prisoners of conscience
 might be detailed by the PRK authorities for "reeducation."
 Amnesty International also reports that "a number of" prisoners
 who had "reformed" were released or had their sentences
 reduced in December 1980, and January 1981. There is no
 habeas corpus or other equivalent practice in the DK or PRK
 system. Those arrested are held for varying lengths of time
 without legal recourse. Preventive detention exists in both
 the DK and PRK and its terms are open-ended. Reports from
 the DK zone in southwestern Kampuchea cite re-education for
 several days as the sentence for DK civilians caught trying
 to flee to Thailand.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Little is known about trials, courts, defense or courts
 called for in the new PRK constitution; they do not exist in
 the DK. In both DK- and PRK-controlled areas, charges are
 frequently vague and unspecified. There is no judiciary
 separate from the executive. There is no right of appeal in
 areas controlled by either the DK or PRK. The PRK regime
 has conducted occasional show trials to make political
 points. Thus DK leaders were tried in absentia in 1979, and
 non-communist resistance figures were tried in mid-1980.
 Amnesty International Report 1981 expresses concern at the
 delay between some prisoners' arrests and their trial, and
 at the retroactive application of judicial legislation and
 decrees. It also expresses concern over reports that in
 late 1980 and early 1981 hundreds of people were detained
 without trial for criticizing the government.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 There are no prohibitions against invasion of the home in
 the DK- or PRK-controlled areas. No warrant is required.
 Local authorities reportedly exercise this practice at will
 in both areas.
 2.   Respect for Civil and.Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 There is no freedom of speech, press, or assembly in either
 the DK or PRK areas. The PRK has introduced news organs,
 but they are not widely distributed. No books are available
 in DK areas. Some textbooks have now been reintroduced in
 the PRK education system. There are few domestic and no
 foreign publications, and books are scrutinized rigorously
 for political content prior to being introduced into the
 PRK-controlled areas. Opposition viewpoints or opinions are
 not tolerated in either DK or PRK areas. Offenders are
 arrested. Serious offenders in the DK-controlled areas
 reportedly are executed. Fear characterizes any deviation
 by Khmer in both areas. Except under the auspices of the DK
 and PRK administrations, public assembly and meetings are
 not allowed. There are no known professional associations
 in either the DK or PRK. Government-controlled labor unions
 gather workers in PRK-controlled.areas.
 Religious beliefs are not an asset politically in either the
 DK or PRK areas. The DK eliminated religious practices
 during its reign, derobed 70,000 monks, and turned some
 2,850 pagodas, as well as some churches and mosques, into
 warehouses or converted them to other secular use. Many
 were destroyed. The PRK administration has tolerated, with
 heavy state controls, the return of some religous practices,
 including some Buddhist temple schools. The supreme patriarch
 
 
 614
 has told journalists that 3,Q00 monks have been re-robed and
 700 pagodas are open. Only men over 50 may re-robe or
 become novices. The supreme patriarch of Khmer monks has
 been a member of the regime's national reconstruction front
 since September 1979, and is a vice-president of the national
 assembly elected in May 1981. Vietnamese advisors, through
 PRK officials, are said to control tightly the observance of
 religious or other festivals and certain Khmer customs.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The PRK and DK attempt to control tightly all travel within
 the regions under their control. Passes are required for
 internal movement between villages. Checkpoints are ubiqui-
 tous in the PRK areas and require bribes to cross even with
 passes in hand. A system of neighborhood surveillance,
 modeled after the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV) system,
 has now been introduced to control the population in the
 PRK. Nonetheless, thousands of Khmer have been able to move
 around the country and to the Thai-Khmer border searching
 for food, family or resistance, or just a chance to think
 things over. Only the very top DK and PRK officials are
 allowed to travel to foreign countries. Emigration is not
 regularized, but cadres of both sides allow Khmer to go to
 the Thai border searching for food or refuge. Since it was
 ousted from Phnom Penh, the DK has urged Khmer to repatriate
 themselves to DK zones and has in fact cooperated in several
 repatriations. The PRK has stated a willingness to permit
 repatriation through official discussions either directly
 with the PRX administration or through such organs as
 National Red Cross societies. Both the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International
 Committee of the Red Cross have held discussions with the
 PRK on repatriation, but no formal' repatriation arrangements
 have yet been made. Voluntary repatriation of Khmer from
 Thailand, not sanctioned by the PRK authorities, was said to
 have been a reason for a June 23, 1980 attack on Khmer
 refugee agglomerations and a Thai village, all inside Thai
 territory. Since late 1980, about nine thousand Khmer in
 holding centers in Thailand have quietly and voluntarily
 returned to the border.   Approximately 30,000 Khmer had
 taken refuge in Thailand prior to the ouster from Phnom Penh
 of the DK by Vietnamese troops. Since the Vietnamese invasion
 in January 1979, approximately 150,000 Khmer have fled to
 Thailand seeking refuge in UNHCR holding centers, and another
 230,000 (down from over half a million in late 1979) still
 seekrefuge and relief along the Thai-Kampuchea border.
 Food shortages in the interior remain the cause of most
 flight to the border agglomerations. Some Khmer who are
 forced to undergo the dangers of escape as refugees would
 qualify as legal immigrants to several foreign countries.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 A Khmer can participate in the political process in either
 the DK or PRK areas only in strict adherence to the rules of
 the communist parties controlling each and in the PRK area
 under the strict control of the occupying force of Vietnamese
 soldiers and civilians. The new PRK constitution calls for
 a political system closely patterned on that of the Vietnamese,
 and the political process is dominated by them. Any political
 deviation, or suspicion of deviation, is harshly punished,
 often by death, particularly in the DK zone. Opposition is
 suppressed ruthlessly in both the DK and PRK areas. Political
 aspirants in the PRK-controlled areas must learn the current
 
 
 615
 political dogma, which is centered on acceptance of the
 Vietnamese explanation for the $RV's dominant political role
 in Kampuchea. Radio Phnom Penh broadcasts have reported that
 DK soldiers who had been captured, or who had surrendered to
 the new authorities, were allowed to rejoin their families
 after a short period. A prison for DK cadre and troops in
 Phnom Penh reeducates them under reportedly good conditions.
 Former prisoners report that political prissoners who show
 "progress" in their political views are able to obtain early
 release.
 The PRK held elections in May 1981 and promulgated a new
 constitution in June. The foreign press observed, but only
 one slate of 148 candidates contested the 117 seats.
 Villagers from rural areas around the country report that
 they did vote, but never saw their candidates and did not
 remember their names. The head of the communist party
 organizational office told a Phnom Penh meeting on the
 national assembly's opening in June 1981 that 81 of the 117
 new deputies were party members. The continued presence of
 180,000 Vietnamese troops, plus Vietnamese administrators,
 raises basic questions concerning the validity of such
 "elections." Women appear to be treated on a roughly
 similar basis as are men in the PRK. While forced marriages
 were common in the DK before 1979, limited recent reports
 suggest that women are not discriminated against in the DK.
 Women serve in high political positions in both the DK and
 PRK. Two women, wives of top political leaders, are minis-
 ters in the DK administration.
 Reports of Vietnamese attacks using unknown lethal and other
 chemical agents against Khmer resisting PRK control along
 the Thai-Kampuchean border have been heard sporadically for
 several years. In 1981, however, newly-analyzed evidence
 from Kampuchea and elsewhere in Southeast Asia lends strong
 weight to the probability that lethal chemical/biological
 agents known as mycotoxins (and perhaps others) have been
 used by the Vietnamese against Khmer resistance. These
 reports have been denied by Vietnam and its client regime in
 Phnom Penh. International efforts continue to gather infor-
 mation, and, without the cooperation of Phnom Penh or Hanoi,
 a special United Nations Committee of experts has tried to
 conduct an impartial investigation into these reports.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-government Investigation of alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Both'the DK and PRK administrations regard any attempt to
 investigate or otherwise inquire into human rights practices
 in Kampuchea as interference in the internal affairs of
 Kampuchea. The PRK has stated a willingness to permit a UN
 investigation of human rights if the investigation also
 looks into charges of genocide under Pol Pot. In October
 1980, the DK adhered to the UN human rights covenant. Neither
 the DK nor the PRK is known to have communicated with any
 non-government human rights organizations. In December
 1980, the United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly
 passed a resolution calling for an impartialinvestigation
 of reports that the USSR and Vietnam are using chemical
 weapons in Southeast Asia and elsewhere, but the PRK and SRV
 governments have refused to cooperate with the special UN
 experts committee implementing the UN General Assembly
 resolution.

 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 The Khmer people were narrowly rescued from massive starva-
 tion in late 1979 by international relief and the 1979-80
 and 1980-81 rice crops. Severe weather problems during the
 1981 rainy season will likely mean serious food shortages in
 certain parts of the country. Although it is too early to
 tell, Kampuchea will probably not achieve food self-sufficiency
 in 1982, and could suffer a rice deficit of 200,000-300,000
 metric tons.. The economy remains one of the world's most
 rudimentary, after it was systematically destroyed during
 the rule of Pol Pot.
 Kampuchea has no foreign exchange and has been dependent
 totally on international assistance to operate. The non-
 communist world has officially provided more than 640
 million dollars since late 1979, principally food, seeds,
 farm implements, medicines and fishing nets. The Soviet and
 the West Europeans claim to have budgeted over 360 million
 dollars in aid since 1979. Vietnam claims to have provided
 aid worth 118 million dollars in 1979 and 1980. During
 1980, the PRK issued a new currency, the first since the DK
 abolished the riel in 1975. Backed by nothing, but equated
 originally at one kilo of rice per riel, the currency has
 gained wide acceptance even though its value fluctuates.
 Early in 1980, the basic commercial economy was resuscitated
 largely by the Khmer people themselves. It is dependent in
 considerable measure on trade through a free market link to
 the Thai-Khmer border, pilfering of supplies provided through
 international relief to Phnom Penh, and the labors of Khmer
 themselves in gathering firewood, fishing, foraging, and
 raising vegetables. This primitive and fragile economy
 continues as lack of foreign 6xchange, raw materials, and
 spare parts limit Cambodian industry. The Soviet Union is
 actively engaged in restoring the Cambodian rubber industry.
 The PRK used international relief to build its administra-
 tion. Until March 1980, relief workers at all levels of the
 administration throughout the country were paid in inter-
 nationally-provided relief commodities, based on the individual's
 rank in the government, military or party, or the type of
 work done. The PRK administration originally provided only
 miniscule quantities of rice (1-2 kilos or less) to rural
 Khmer who did not work for the administration. The regime
 provided greater amounts of seed in 1981 than in 1980, but
 five hundred tons were sent by international humanitarian
 agencies across the Thai border from Thailand into western
 Kampuchea at the site of the "landbridge."
 After abolishing the communes of the Pol Pot era, the PRK
 administration established work solidarity teams to farm
 collective lands in the villages. Villagers thus far are
 also allowed small private plots to cultivate vegetables and
 other crops. Taxes were not levied on the meager 1979-80
 crop. Nor did the central government tax the 1980-81 crop,
 but a few reports from Battambang province cited a very low
 tax in kind by local authorities to be used on local projects
 such as schools and hospitals. In one instance, a hospital
 was built. The regime has not announced its plans yet for
 the 1981-82. harvest.
 The question of land ownership has not yet been clearly
 defined, but villagers understand that land is owned collec-
 tively. Draft animals and plows are apparently held privately,
 but used collectively. In most areas, owners of such means
 of production have the right to an extra share of the harvest.
 Sanitation and medical services remain at very low levels.
 
 
 617
 Disease is prevalent. The PRK for a long time refused to
 admit non-communist foreign medical teams.
 Despite numerous offers, only a few International Committee
 of the Red Cross teams have been allowed into the area
 controlled by the PRK, even though only fifty doctors survived
 the Pol Pot regime. The medical and pharmacy school in
 Phnom Penh has reopened, but medicines are in extremely
 short supply. Provincial hospitals usually are staffed by
 one Vietnamese and one Khmer doctor. District and village
 facilities have nurses and medics with only minimal training.
 Internationally-donated medicines are in rare supply. They
 are frequently sold in the state facilities at prices too
 high for most Khmer, if they are not placed for sale in the
 market. Administrative cadres, Heng Samrin soldiers and
 officials receive preferential medical attention. Corrup-
 tion is reportedly highly developed in the PRK medical
 system, as well as in the food distribution system.
 The PRK has established literacy schools for teaching the
 Khmer language, and reports that over nine hundred thousand
 students currently are studying in the rudimentary schools.
 Many segments of the population also receive political
 education in preparation for assuming administrative re-
 sponsibilities.
 Most Khmer remain close to survival standards because of the
 devastation of the Pol Pot years and the conflict, famine
 and meager crops which resulted from the Vietnamese invasion
 and occupation of Kampuchea in January 1979 at the time of
 the harvest. Only a handful of Khmer in the PRK regime's
 top party and military echelons can be said to earn enough
 to save reserves for later years. The remainder are living
 essentially from hand to mouth. Rural Khmer are discrimi-
 nated against, as indicated above, and those in areas of
 marginal security are denied access to any rations from the
 administration, as are those who are suspect politically.
 Rations are distributed by quotas, but the supplies are
 usually exhausted before those not associated closely with
 the regime received their quota. In areas under DK control,
 about which less is known, the administration retains full
 control over production and distribution. Soldiers and
 cadres are noticeably better fed and are provided medical
 services more regularly than are civilians. The incidence
 of malaria and other diseases is reportedly high. No market
 economy or monetary system is established in DK-controlled
 areas. The DK teaches some reading and revolutionary songs.
 During 1975-1978, the DK regime practiced severe and violent
 discrimination against ethnic Vietnamese, Chinese and Chams,
 the Muslim minority, in areas under DK control. Women
 generally are remunerated on roughly the same minimal basis
 as men in both the PRK and DK. Earlier, under DK rule, far
 fewer women than men were executed. In areas controlled by
 the non-communist resistance along the Thai border, Khmer
 now receive barely adequate food and marginally sufficient
 medical treatment from international humanitarian groups and
 have established primitive schools and cultural programs.
 The massive effects of the years of war on the people and
 economy of Kampuchea have made it impossible to gather
 credible current statistics on such matters as population
 growth rates, life expectancy, literacy, school attendance,
 per capita income, and the like.
