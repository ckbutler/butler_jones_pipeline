 LIBERIA
 After more than 7 years of civil war, implementation of the August 1996 Abuja
 Peace Accord restored peace to Liberia. The human costs of the war were im-
 mense-200,000 war-related deaths, 1.2 million persons displaced interially, and
 approximately 750,000 refugees in neighboring countries.
 Under the provisions of the Abuja Accords, presidential and legislative elections
 were held on July 19 for the first time in 12 years. Thirteen political parties com-
  eted, including the parties of the three major former faction leaders-Charles G.
 Tylor, Alhaji Kromah, and George Boley. Charles Taylor won the presidency with
 over three-quarters of the votes cast and his party, the National Patriotic Party,
 won control of both houses of the legislature. The elections were judged free and
 transparent by international observers. Taylor was inaugurated as President on Au-
 gust 2 and promised to give high priority to national reconciliation, human rights,
 the rule of law, ensuring a stable environment for economic development, and elimi-
 
 
 nating corruption. The judiciary is subject to political influence, outside pressure,
 and corruption.
 Approximately 10,500 West African pacekeeprs (ECOMOG) were deployed
 throughout the country, provi the the security that facilitated disarmament, demo-
 bilization, the holding of national elections, and the return of some refugees. More
 than 20,000 weapons and over 10 million rounds of ammunition were turned in to
 ECOMOG between November 1996 and February 1997, the end of the period for vol-
 untary disarmament. Demobilization and reintegration programs for the more than
 20,000 former combatants who disarmed (21 percent of whom were former child
 fighters under age 17) were established but many former combatants were unable
 to participate. While significant disarmament was achieved, factional command and
 control structures were not completely dismantled and remained largely in place.
 ECOMOG remained the key military force supporting the Liberian National Transi-
 tion Governments (LNTG) III and IV as well as the new Taylor administration. In
 December ECOMOG began drawing down its troops in preparation for leaving the
 ountry;   d agreement or a continued ECOMOG presence was being negotiates. For
 the past 7 years, ECOMOG assumed many police powe in the absence of a central
 government capability. The outlook for maintenance of security after ECOMOG's de-
 parture remains unclear. Although the ECOMOG peacekeeping force generally
 maintained internal discipline, there were a number of incidents in which individual
 ECOMOG soldiers killed and tortured civilians
 As an institution, the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) remained largely inactive.
 In October the Government announced that it would begin restructuring the AFL,
 although the Abuja Accords stated that ECOMOG was to restructure the AFL. The
 President's decision resulted in a very public dispute between him and the
 ECOMOG force commander. The new       or administration also sought to move
 4,000 largely Krahn AFL troops andh the familiecfromnthe central gbarracks in
 downtown Monrovia to the outskirts of the capital, creating tension between the
 AEL troops and the new Government.
 Under the LNTG II and IV Governments, the Liberia National Police (LNP) and
 the National Security Agency (NSA), which report to the Ministry of Justice, to-
 gether with the Special Security Services (SSS), which report directly to the Head
 of State, were responsible for internal security, but they lacked the resources and
 training to function effectively. After Taylor's inaugration in August, his adminis-
 tration made security a top priority, placing many NPFL former combatants in the
 security apparatus. In September ay r reappointed as police director his cousin,
 who was known to have directed and participated in the looting of Monrovia in April
 and May 1996. In October the President announed that a 1,000-man paramilitary
 force would be armed and deployed along the border witierra Leone to prevent
 a spillover of hostilities from that country. By year's end, the administration had
 placed several hundred unarmed NSA and SSS officials at major border crossing
 points with Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, and Sierra Leone. Members of the security forces
 committed human rights abuses.
 The economy, ravaged by civil war, remained in severe disarray. The Taylor ad-
 ministration inherited an extrnal debt estimated at over $2 billion and over $230
 million in domestic debt. No reliable information on the gross domestic product was
 available. Prior to 1990, the cash economy was based primarily on iron ore, rubber,
 timber, diamond, and gold exports. Eighty-five percent unemployment, a 15 percent
 literacy rate, the continued internal displacement of civilians, and the absence of in-
 frastructure throughout the country continued to depress productive capacity, de-
 spite the countrs rich natural reso uces and potential self-sufficienc' in food. Gov-
 ernment officials, businessmen, and former combatants continued to exploit the
 wealth of the country, logging old growth timber through environmentally unsound
 mining methods, and illegally tapping rubber trees in plantations under their con-
 trol. Profits from these illicit enterprises were used for personal benefit. In Decem-
 ber the President announced that a new currency would be introduced in 1998 to
 replace the two separate currencies that were in use in different parts of the country
 in addition to the U.S. dollar, which is also legal currency. The new currency was
 designed to address the multiple currencies problem, which had hindered economic
 activity.
 The Government's human rights record was poor, and there were serious prob-
 lems in many areas; however, there was some improvement in comparison with
 1996. Security provided throubout the country by ECOMOG and the largely suc-
 cessful disarmament program led to a decline in human rights abuses prior to Sep-
 tember; however, abuses increased towards the end of the year. Security forces com-
 mitted extrajudicial killings; however, it was difficult to distinguish in many cases
 whether some killings were a result of political, criminal, ethnic, r o ther motives.
 Security forces were responsible for a number of disappearances. Security forces
 
 
 183
 beat citizens, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs used torture to coerce confessions.
 Conditions in jails remained life threatening, and police and other security forces
 at times arbitrarily arrested and detained persons and infringed on citizens' privacy
 rights. On two occasions, the Government investigated orpunished security force
 members for offenses. The judicial system, hampered by inefficiency, corruption, and
 a lack of resources, was reconstituted in April with the installation of a
 defactionalized, independent Supreme Court to decide disputes arising from the na-
 tional elections. However, after his election, President Taylor, exercising his con-
 stitutional prerogative, installed a new Supreme Court. The judiciary was generally
 unable to provide citizens in all parts of the country with their rights to due process
 and a fair trial due to lack of resources. The Government limited freedom of speech
 and the press; security forces intimidated and occasionally beat journalists, and
 journalists often practiced self-censorship. The Government restricted freedom of
 movement. Unfavorable conditions limited the return of refugees from neighboring
 countries, as well as former combatants who were not relocated after disarmament.
 However, by December more than 100,000 refugees and internally displaced persons
 had returned to their previous home areas. Approximately 1.5 million citizens de-
 pend upon humanitarian assistance to survive. At year's end, authorities increased
 the harassment of democracy and human rights groups. Violence and discrimination
 against women, and violence against children are longstanding problems. The prac-
 tice of female genital mutilation (FGM) persisted, although apparently on a much
 reduced scale. Discrimination against religious and ethnic minorities remained a
 problem. Forced labor, including by children, was a problem, and authorities pro-
 vided little protection for worker rights. Ritualistic killings and vigilante justice con-
 tinued.
 No progress was made in resolving outstanding incidents of past human rights
 abuses, despite the appeal of many local and international organizations. The Taylor
 administration enacted a controversial bill in October to create a Human Rights
 Commission, which was limited to investigating only current and future human
 rights abuses, with no power to compel the testimony of witnesses and no govern-
 ment funding to conduct its activities. In December President Taylor appointed a
 former rival, Alhaji Kromah, as chairman of the commission on national reconcili-
 ation; however, the commission was not constituted or functioning by year's end.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The incidence of political and
 extrajudicial violence and killing decreased in comparison with 1996, but violence
 and killings increased during the last months of the year. It was often difficult, how-
 ever, to distinguish between political, criminal, or ethnic killings. Members of the
 security forces committed a number of extrajudicial killings.
 On January 16, nine people, includingfive former fighters of the ULIMO-Krahn
 faction, were ambushed and killed on the Tubmanburg highway in Bomi County,
 allegedly by former members of the Congo Defense Force. Also in January, a
 Mandingo taxi driver was brutally murdered in Monrovia. The killing led to a wild-
 cat strike of taxi drivers, most of whom are Mandingos, who claimed continued anti-
 Mandingo bias in the society (see Section 5). In March a senior government official
 from the Ministry of Finance was killed in his home in the course of an apparent
 robbery. Some observers believe that he was killed to conceal alleged governmental
 financial mismanagement.
 In August and September, a number of bodies of individuals killed in suspicious
 circumstances were discovered in Monrovia, for example, the body of an unidentified
 adult male was found on the lawn of a former finance minister who belongs to the
 Mandingo ethnic group. In August a female teacher and major opposition party sup-
 porter was killed by an unknown assailant. Thirteen bodies were found in the 2-
 month period. There is no conclusive evidence whether the killings were criminally
 or politically motivated. There have been no leads as to the perpetrators.
 In October police, alleging an escape attempt, fatally shot a suspected armed rob-
 ber, there are unconfirmed reports that he was shot in the back of the head at close
 range and that he had ties to a major opposition political party. Also in October,
 Monrovia city police beat a taxi driver to death for a minor vehicle violation. No
 action was taken against the police. On November 29, government security person-
 nel detained opposition political leader Samuel Saye Dokie and three family mem-
 bers at a checkpoint near Gbarnga, Bong County. The Dokies disappeared. Their
 mutilated, burned bodies were discovered 3 days later. The head of the SSS admit-
 ted that he had ordered the Dokies arrest, but disavowed participation in or knowl-
 edge of the Dokies' murder. Five suspects, including at least three SSS officers in-
 
 
 volved in the Dokie abduction, were subsequently arrested; they were awaiting trial
 at years end. On December 19, a 34-year-old man, who had been beaten brutally
 by police, died while in custody in Monrovia. At year's end, no action had been
 taken against the police.
 At least two persons died in detention facilities due to harsh conditions and offi-
 cial negligence (see Section 1.c.).
 The results of the investigation into the October 1996 assassination attempt
 against Charles Taylor was never made public.
 Ritualistic killings, in which young people are murdered and bodyparts extracted,
 continued. Incidents included: In February an 18-year-old boy in Gardnersville, a
 Monrovia suburb; in March in Junction, Grand Cape Mount county, a young woman;
 in May a 1-month old baby in Caldwell, Montserrado county, also in May, a fisher-
 man in Grand Bassa county; in October, a 2-year-old girl in Buchanan, Grand Bassa
 county; and a young man from Monrovia in September. No police action has been
 reported against such practices.
 Vigilante justice also continued. In February civilians in Monrovia caught and
 beat to death a known rapist and armed robber after police refused to take the sus-
 pect into custody. The police subsequently took no action.
 No progress was made in investigating the many killings from previous years, in-
 cluding two massacres in Sinje, Grand Cape Mount county in 1996. There was no
 progress in the case of the canibalization of a university student referred to civil
 authorities by ECOMOG or the canibalization of the AFL Chief of Staff in 1996.
 There was no further developments in the discovery of mass graves in 1996. None
 of the equipment stolen from international agencies was returned and none of those
 who stole relief supplies and food in 1996 were tried or punished for their crimes.
 Although ECOMOG generally maintained internal discipline, there were a num-
 ber of incidents in which individual ECOMOG soldiers killed civilians. In February
 ECOMOG soldiers were involved in the death of a man in Vonzula, Grand Cape
 Mount county. In May during a cordon-and-search opration for illegal weapons at
 Lajoy gold mine, Grand Cape Mount county, ECOMOG soldiers tortured and mur-
 dered two men. In June ECOMOG soldiers also beat to death a man in Sanoyea,
 Bong county while interrogating him. There was no reported investigation of the in-
 cident or punishment of the soldiers involved.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no confirmed reports of disappearances per-
 petrated by ECOMOG or the LNTG III regular police or security forces. However,
 there were credible reports that security forces were involved in such disappear-
 ances. Members of the joint security forces of the LNTG IV in May attacked and
 beat the general commander of a police station in Monrovia who later disappeared.
 In December four persons incarcerated in the (Gbarnga) Bong county detention facil-
 ity disappeared. There have been confirmed disappearances of a few people and sev-
 eral opposition activists and businessmen are missing or otherwise unaccounted for
 at year's end.
 There were credible reports that a number of demobilized child fighters, who had
 been reunited with their families, were abducted again by members of their former
 warring factions for forced labor (see Section 5).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other degrading treatment; however, govern-
 ment security forces beat persons, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs used torture
 to coerce confessions.
 During the latter part of the year, there were numerous credible reports of gov-
 ernment security forces beating and intimidating journalists (see Section 2.a.), as
 well as beating civilians for minor offenses.
 The Ministry of Internal Affairs used torture to coerce confessions. Although the
 Supreme Court ruled that "trial by ordeal," or "sassywood"-commonly, the place-
 ment of a burning metal object on a suspect's body to induce confession in a criminal
 investigation-is unconstitutional, the Ministry of Internal Affairs continued to have
 licensed agents who subjected suspects to this practice at the Ministry. A lawsuit
 brought in 1994 for injuries -resulting from sassywood is still pending before the Su-
 preme Court.
 In September joint security forces and ECOMOG troops wounded six people at the
 Bridgestone/Firestone rubber plantation in Harbel, Margibi county, during a labor
 strike (see Section 6.e.).
 After the end of the period for voluntary disarmament in February, some
 ECOMOG troops detained more than 50 former fighters during nationwide cordon-
 and-search operations for weapons. Many of these former combatants reported being
 tortured to elicit information about illegal weapons; they were then incarcerated in
 the Monrovia Central Prison. The prisoners were never charged with any offense
 and were released in March. During several cordon-and-search operations in which
 
 
 ECOMOG arrested, interrogated, and shot several former combatants, ECOMOG
 left the victims, who in some cases suffered life-threatening injuries, untreated; but
 following the intervention of an international organization, the victims received
 treatment. Individual ECOMOG soldiers also tortured and killed persons (see Sec-
 tion L.a.).
 In September and October, while enforcing a long-forgotten law that prohibits
 market activity on Sundays and at any time during the week on the streets, police
 beat several women marketeers, confiscated and never returned thousands of dol-
 lars worth of goods and produce, and destroyed hundreds of small market stalls.
 There were many incidents in which former combatants, who claimed not to have
 received sufficient benefits for disarming, harassed and extorted civilians and, in
 some areas, engaged in massive looting. There were credible reports that returning
 refugees and dspaced persons were harassed by former combatants, especially in
 the border areas. Also in January, civilians in Grand Cape Mount asked that hu-
 manitarian relief supplies not be delivered for fear that former fighters would con-
 tinue to steal the supplies at gunpoint (see Section 1.f.). In February when former
 fighters in Nimba, Bomi, and Grand Cape Mount counties continued to harass civil-
 ians, the ECOMOG force commander issued a stern warning about such behavior
 and took additional steps to protect civilians.
 In January several individuals, who claimed to have been kidnaped, incarcerated,
 and tortured in the Watanga (Monrovia) secret jail of the former NPLF faction, pub-
 licized the details of their detention. Their claims appeared to be credible. They also
 reported that other persons were murdered and that they were ordered to bury
 them.
 Neither the LNTG III, LNTG IV, nor the newly elected Government adequately
 addressed the often life threatening conditions in government jails. The Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), in cooperation with the Ministry of
 Justice, sought to make improvements to prison facilities in Monrovia and Kakata.
 The Governments did not provide prisoners with adequate food or medical care.
 They did not pay guards for months. Cells were small, crowded, and filthy. Two in-
 mates died in the Bong County detention facility in November, allegedly from star-
 vation. Women, constituted about 5 percent of the prison population, and were held
 in separate cells, but there were no separate facilities for juvenile offenders. Police
 who caught children for petty crimes often took them to their own homes rather
 than incarcerating the minors with adult criminals.
 The police director ordered the escaped prisoners released in 1996 to return to jail
 or be subject of an intensive search. One prisoner surrendered, but later escaped
 aTuran rights groups were granted access to prisoners in Monrovia, and these
 groups frequently obtained needed medical treatment for prisoners. In a number of
 cases, human rights groups and interested individuals achieved the release of pris-
 oners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and provides for the rights of the accused, including warrants for arrests, and
 the right of detainees either to be charged or released within 48 hours. In practice
 some LNP officers and other security officials often disregarded these rights and
 made arbitrary arrests. Many officers, whose average-monthly salary was already
 less than $5.00, often were not paid and accepted bribes to arrest persons based on
 unsubstantiated allegations. The police have almost no logistic or forensic capabili-
 ties, and generally were unable to investigate crimes, including murder cases. Most
 people arrested for serious crimes are not released within 48 hours or brought be-
 fore a judge as the Constitution requires. In September and October, the new police
 director, allegedly in an effort to combat the increase of armed robberies in the cap-
 ital, arrested dozens of suspects who were incarcerated for prolonged periods with-
 out being charged. The police director and the SSS director also frequently forced
 journalists who published stories perceived as antigovernment to visit police head-
 quarters or the Justice Ministry where they were often threatened and intimidated.
 In July the editor of the Liberia Communications Network was arrested at a press
 conference held in the Independent Elections Commission's (JECOM) headquarters
 after asking the IECOM chairman whether there had been tampering with the bal-
 lots for the national election; the editor was not charged and was later released. In
 August the editor of the Funtimes Gazette was arrested for publishing an article
 about President Taylor's personal life. Following public criticism, the editor was re-
 leased. In October the LNP Director ordered the editor of the Inquirer newspaper,
 which had published several critical articles about the police, arrested for allegedly
 buying stolen property, although there was no evidence to support the charge. The
 Inquirer editor later was released. The police director also attempted, but failed, to
 have Liberia's leading human rights advocate arrested following a press conference
 
 
 that the advocate had called to protest the Inquirer's editor's arrest. Following pub-
 lic criticism, this matter, too, was dropped. Also in October, the LNP Director or-
 dered the arrest of one of his officers without an arrest warrant, based upon the
 officer's reported death threat against the director. The arresting officers, unable to
 locate the individual either at his home or at church, detained the man's wife, chil-
 dren, and other occupants of the house; a local human rights organization urged po-
 lice to release them from unconstitutional detention, which they did once the officer
 surrendered.
 ECOMOG soldiers played the major role in policing the country, particularly dur-
 ing the early part of the year. Many citizens continued to turn to ECOMOG rather
 than the unarmed, unpaid, and underequipped police force to arrest and detain al-
 leged criminals. ECOMOG regularly turned detainees over to civilian authorities. In
 ay, however, ECOMOG detained several former members of the ULIMO-Krahn
 faction in Tubmanburg and a former Krahn cabinet minister and two assistants in
 Monrovia for their allegedparticipation in an attempt to assassinate Charles Taylor.
 Although the Krahn were held for several weeks, they were never charged or turned
 over to civilian authorities.
 The Government does not employ forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Although the Constitution provides for an inde-
 pendent judiciary, the judiciary has always been subject to political, social, familial,
 and financial pressures. Corruption and lack of professionalism remained a recur-
 rent problem. Even after the elections, the judiciary did not function in most areas
 of the country due to lack of infrastructure. Acting under his constitutional author-
 ity, in October President Taylor installed a new Supreme Court which began mak-
 ing plans to make the judiciary more professional and reestablish courts outside of
 the capital. All of the new Supreme Court justices are trained professionals. At
 year's end, how they will execute their responsibilities is not clear.
 The court structure is divided into four levels, with the Supreme Court at its
 apex. All levels of the court system in Monrvia, including the Supreme Court, func-
 tioned, though erratically. Two new courts were established. Although a new juve-
 nile court was constituted in June, the first in the country's history, no cases were
 tried. A criminal court for hearing armed robbery cases also was created, but re-
 mained relatively inactive due to lack of resources and trained personnel.
 Under the Constitution, defendants have due process rights that conform to inter-
 nationally accepted norms for fair trial. Most of these rights, however, were ignored
 in practice. Customary law also was used and, as in previous years, the Ministry
 of Internal Affairs subjected persons accused of occult practices and other crimes to
 "trial by ordeal," submitting defendants to physical pain to adjudicate guilt or inno-
 cence (see Section 1..).
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-While
 the Constitution provides for these rights, authorities sometimes ignored them. The
 Constitution provides that police must obtain a warrant, or have a reasonable belief
 that a crime is in progress, or is about to be committed, before entering a private
 dwelling. In practice most police and other governmental security forces entered pri-
 vate homes and churches without a warrant to carry out arrests and investigations.
 In one case, police arrested family members of a suspect whom they sought to locate
 (see Section 1.d.)J
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-More than a million civilians remained dependent on humanitarian aid for
 survival. However, before the end of the period for voluntary disarmament in Feb-
 ruary, some civilians asked that no food be delivered to their communities because
 they did not want to be further brutalized by factional fighters, who seized such pro-
 visions from their homes and communities. In June former fighters in Bong county
 went on a rampage and looted civilian homes as well as a Catholic relief service
 food warehouse. In December disgruntled former NPFL fighters looted and set
 ablaze the homes of administration officials in more than 10 towns, including Bu-
 chanan, in Grand Bassa county, claiming that President Taylor had neglected them
 since they were disarmed.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, however, the Government limited and continually challenged these
 freedoms. In April the NPFL-appointed Information Minister blocked the publica-
 tion of six Monrovia newspapers, claiming that they had not paid the required reg-
 istration fees. His action was interpreted as an indirect warning that the Govern-
 ment would ban papers if it objected to what was printed. In July after a local news-
 paper reprinted a foreign newspaper editorial about Taylor's election victory, the In-
 
 
 formation Minister cautioned members of the press to scrutinize their newspapers
 to ensure that they accorded due courtesy and respect for government officials. In
 November the Minister also blocked the reopening of an independent newspaper, al-
 legedly because the law required that permits be requested in January. Shortly
 thereafter, the Information Minister granted a permit to another new newspaper
 owned by the President. The Minister also repeatedly warned members of the press
 to be careful about what they printed concerning the Government and singled out
 three newspapers in particular as being antigovernment. Citizens, including journal-
 ists, usually showed considerable restraint and self-censorship in favor of the Gov-
 ernment. In November the Taylor administration also threatened to close the na-
 tional radio station, which was known for its independence. In December the sta-
 tion's reporting became more favorable towards the Government. Government har-
 assment of the press increased noticeably at year's end.
 Starting in September, arbitrary arrest, illegal detention, and intimidation of jour-
 nalists by government security forces became commonplace (see Section 1.d.). Six
 independent newspaper editors and many journalists were arbitrarily detained and
 arrested for publishing articles that security forces considered antigovernment; a
 well-known former NPFL general and six unidentified men attempted to kidnap a
 leading broadcast journalist from his home; the country's foremost political cartoon-
 ist received numerous death threats and may have been put under surveillance by
 government security forces; an independent journalist, who was detained in Bong
 County following the Dokie funeral and his attempted investigation into the cir-
 cumstances surrounding the Dokies' deaths, was charged by the police with treason;
 this charge was later reduced.
 The restrictive Media Law, instituted during the Doe regime in the 1980's, re-
 mained in force and provided the Ministry of Information with wide discretion in
 regulating journalists. In May the Press Union of Liberia adopted a code of conduct
 for journalists to encourage professionalism. The code of conduct, however, in some
 instances appeared aimed at punishing journalists for publishing articles unfavor-
 able to the Government. Some members of the press were barred from official press
 conferences at the executive mansion for printing stories unfavorable to the Govern-
 ment; other members of the press were beaten at the executive mansion by govern-
 ment officials. No official action was taken against the perpetrators.
 Largely as a result of the national elections and the candidates' desire to influence
 ublic opinion, the press grew from 6 newspapers in January to 15 by July. Charles
 aylor either owned or controlled seven of the newspapers that published regularly
 up to the elections. Newspapers controlled by other prominent political figures usu-
 ally were published only when there was a political purpose involved. All eight inde-
 pendent newspapers had to deal with repeated attempts at censorship and struggled
 to stay in business. By October the number of regularly published newspapers had
 dropped to six. Four could be considered independent and, when the Government
 allowed them, were capable of serious, critical, newsworthy reporting.
 Before the war, there were three regional television stations in operation in addi-
 tion to one in Monrovia. Regular television broadcasts ceased when the war started
 in 1989. The President's privately owned media company reopened a television sta-
 tion in Monrovia on August 2 to broadcast Taylor's inauguration. The station re-
 mained on the air but only broadcast sporadically. In September DUCOR Radio
 Broadcasting opened Monrovia's second television. It, too, broadcast only sporadi-
 cally.
 Throughout the year, the government radio station (ELBC), the Taylor-owned sta-
 tion (KISS-FM), and the two independents-Radio Monrovia and DUCOR radio-
 broadcast regularly but only within the greater Monrovia area. A Taylor-owned
 short wave radio station, based in Totota, Bong county, also broadcast throughout
 West Africa, the only station with such a capacity prior to the holding of national
 elections on July 19. This short wave radio station was the only source of informa-
 tion for voters outside the greater Monrovia area and contributed to Taylor's elec-
 toral victory. The ELBC also had a short wave radio, but it broadcast only spradi-
 cally. Subsequent to the election, two other radio stations-the Catholic Church's
 Radio Veritas and the independent Star Radio-began broadcasting throughout the
 country. With the exception of the Taylor-owned media, most other stations, includ-
 ing the government-owned station, were poorly equipped and subject to pressure
 from government officials. In December the Ministry of Post and Telecommuni-
 cations claimed that Radio Veritas and Star Radio were illegally using diplomatic
 broadcast frequencies and threatened to shut them down. In early January 1998,
 Star Radio was closed by the Government.
 During the IECOM announcement of election results, ECOMOG forced Radio
 Monrovia to stop its live broadcasts.
 
 
 Academic freedom was generally respected at the University of Liberia; however,
 the administrators and faculty carefully avoided antagonizing any powerful interest
 groups. The students felt more free to voice their criticisms. Due to a lack of fund-
 ing, the university did not begin its academic year in August, as is customary, but
 resumed in December.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly and the Government generally respects this right, but
 limited it in some instances. Although ECOMOG generally ensured security
 throughout the country in the period leading up to and during the presidential cam-
 paign and on election day, there were several incidents of political harassment and
 violence against candidates. While campaigning in Sanniquellie, Nimba county, the
 Unity Party standard-bearer and her campaign workers were assaulted: Taylor par-
 tisans smashed the candidate's car windshield, threw acid on two of her campaign
 workers, and severely beat another. On June 17, in Gbarnga, Bong county, the Ref-
 ormation Alliance Party's presidential candidate was greeted by catcalls and rock
 throwing by Taylor artisans when he began his campaign in the former NPFL
 stnghold. Several other incidents were reported around the country, especially in
 Monrovia. However, the number of incidents decreased as the electoral campaign
 progressed and total violence during the campaign was low. The Constitution pro-
 vides for the right of association, and the Government generally respects this right,
 but limited it in some instances.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution recognizes freedom of religion as a fun-
 damental right, and Liberia has no established state religion. Although Islam is
 ganing adherents, as much as 40 percent of the population profess to be Christian.
 Asignificant portion of the population follows traditional animism or blends tradi-
 tional religions with Christianity or Islam. Although the law prohibits religious dis-
 crimination, Islamic leaders complained that Muslims, especially Mandingos, were
 discriminated against (see Section 5). In September when the new Speaker of the
 House invited a Muslim mulh to open the session with a prayer, Christian meme-
 hers of the House strenuously objected, arguing that such action was unconstitu-
 tional. After long debate, the mulla was allowed to pray, but the legal issue re-
 mains unresolved.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement throughout the
 country as well as the right to leave or enter. In the period leading to national elec-
 tions, ECOMOG maintained numerous checkpoints throughout the country. The
 week before the July 19 p residential election, the border with Guinea was closed,
 although the border with Cote d'Ivoire remained open. After the elections, ECOMOG
 significantly reduced the number of its checkpoints and began to prepare for hand-
 ing over its security functions to the new Government. Freedom of movement within
 the country after the Taylor administration took office was further restricted by nu-
 merous checkoints set up by security forces and by the extremely poor condition
 of roads that had not been maintained during the 7 years of war. Also in December,
 the Government reinstituted an exit visa requirement for all residents and some-
 times refused to issue permits for travel. The Government also announced that dip-
 lomats should notify the Foreign Ministry a week in advance of any proposed travel
 outside of the capital.
 Seioe government officials, including the police, and some former fighters set up
 roadblocks to harass and extort money or other valuables from civilians, including
 internally displaced people and refugees who had returned to their home towns and
 villages, and humanitarian aid workers.
 Following the military coup in Sierra Leone in May, ECOMOG increased its pres-
 ence along the border with Sierra Leone and, at different times, when fighting in-
 tensified in eastern Sierra Leone, restricted access to its border area. On October
 21, the Taylor administration announced that it was closing the border with Sierra
 Leone to prevent fighting in Sierra Leone from reigniting fighting in Liberia. The
 practical effect of this announcement was unclear since ECOMOG controlled the
 borders. Following fighting in Sierra Leone in December, more refugees fled into Li-
 beria through unmanned border crossing points.
 Since 1990 over 1.2 million citizens (of an estimated prewar population of 2.8 mil-
 lion) have been internally displaced. With the improved security conditions made
 possible by ECOMOG, more than 100,000 internally displaced persons and refugees
 returned to their home villages to register and vote. According to the UNHCR, as
 many as 480,000 Liberian refugees remain in neighboring West African countries.
 The Government provided first asylum. Following the military coup in Sierra
 Leone in May, about 30,000 new Sierra Leonean refugees fled to Liberia. Although
 no official census has been taken, there are probably more than 120,000 Sierra
 Leoneans llving along the western border in Grand Cape Mount and Lefa counties.

 The LNTG III and IV Governments and the Taylor administration cooperated
 with the office of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and
 other humanitarian organizations in attempting to assist refugees, primarily Sierra
 Leoneans. However, inaccessibility to refugees due to poor road conditions and the
 limited capacity of local NGO's severely limited the amount of relief assistance that
 could be provided. The Taylor administration has cooperated with the UNHCR's ef-
 forts to inform Liberian refugees about the UNHCR's voluntary repatriation oper-
 ations. There were no reports of forced return of persons to a country where they
 feared persecution.
 There were several instances of mistreatment of foreigners, including citizens of
 ECOWAS countries, especially Nigerians. In September two members of ECOMOG's
 Nigerian contingent (which constituted over half of the ECOMOG force) in Monrovia
 were stoned and beaten by a mob provoked by the superstitious belief that even
 slight body contact with foreigners could harm Liberians. Several immigration offi-
 cers were dismissed for beating and harassing foreign nationals in October. Some
 members of the expatriate community complained about the Taylor administration's
 lack of cooperation in issuing visas. In October the administration announced that
 Sierra Leonean refugees living in Grand Cape Mount county would be moved inland
 for security reasons, but at year's end had not implemented this policy.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for the right of free and fair elections and citizens exer-
 cised their right to change their government in elections deemed free and trans-
 parent on July 19. Since the election was held on the basis of proportional represen-
 tation, President Taylor's party, the National Patriotic Party, won control of the leg-
 islature by the same 75 percent margin that he won the presidency.
 The July 19 national elections were held under the auspices of the Abuja II Peace
 Accord rather than the Constitution. On the first day that the newly elected na-
 tional legislature convened, it reaffirmed the primacy of the Constitution in all mat-
 ters, including future elections.
 At year's end, the legislature had not exercised real independence from the execu-
 tive branch. There are only a handful of opposition legislators, but they tend to be
 much weaker than traditional opposition figures.
 There are no restrictions on the participation of women in politics; however, they
 are underrepresented, largely illiterate, and generally did not have access to voter
 and civic education programs during preelectoral activities. The sole female can-
 didate among 13 in the presidential race finished a distant second. Overall numbers
 of women inhigh-ranking psitions in the Taylor administration and in the various
 political parties are low. Two of the 20 cabinet positions are held by women and
 a woman was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
 One cabinet minister is Muslim (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The LNTG III and IV Governments and the Taylor administration permitted do-
 mestic and international human rights grou s to operate. During the national elec-
 tions, more than 400 international and 600 focal observers surveyed election activi-
 ties. However, at year's end, reported incidents of harassment of democracy and
 human rights groups had increased.
 Domestic human rights organizations were underfunded, understaffed, and their
 personnel lacked adequate training. In September 12 of the small, local human
 rights organizations joined to establish the National Human Rights Center of Libe-
 ria. In October four human rights groups constituted a new umbrella organization
 called the Liberia Federation of Human Rights Organizations. Both of these organi-
 zations sought to ensure that human rights issues were kept in the forefront of the
 country's postconflict development plan.
 Some of the human rights groups, as well as lawyers performing legal aid work
 and U.N. human rights personnel, visited prisoners in the police holding cells and
 the central prison. None reported governmental interference with their activities. As
 a result of the security environment provided by ECOMOG prior to the elections,
 several domestic human rights organizations established branches outside of the
 capital.
 he United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) had responsibility for
 monitoring the human rights situation until September 30, when its mandate ended
 following completion of disarmament, demobilization, and the holding of national
 elections. For 9 months, three experienced UNOMIL human rights officers con-
 ducted investigations and worked to build the capacity of local human rights organi-
 
 
 190
 zations. No UNOMIL human rights reports were made public. In December it was
 announced that a U.N. peace-building mission would be established in Monrovia for
 6 months.
 In October the new Government created a human rights commission; however, it
 triggered considerable controversy by limiting the commission's investigatory power
 to prospective abuses only, with no power to compel testimony or gather evidence
 and no funding to support operations. At year's end, the human rights commission
 had not functioned. Although the independent media urged the Government to cre-
 ate a commission to investigate the Dokie murders, the Government declined.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on ethnic background, race, sex,
 creed, place of origin, or political opinion, but discrimination exists. There are no
 laws against gender based discrimination, ethnic discrimination, or female genital
 mutilation (FGM).
 Women.-Domestic violence against women was extensive but never seriously ad-
 dressed as an issue by the governments, the courts, or the media. Several NGO's
 in Monrovia and Buchanan continued programs to treat abused women and girls
 and increase awareness of their human rights, but NGO's are not vocal about wom-
 en's political rights.
 The status of women varies by region, ethnic group, and religion. Before the out-
 break of the civil war, women held one-fourth of the professional and technical occu-
 pational positions in Monrovia. Some women currently hold skilled jobs in govern-
 ment, including the judiciary. On the whole, however, the situation of women dete-
 riorated dramatically with the onset of war, the closing of most schools, and the loss
 of their traditional role in the production, allocation, and sale of food. In urban
 areas, women can inherit land and property. In rural areas, where traditional cus-
 toms are stronger, a woman is normally considered the property of her husband and
 his clan and usually is not entitled to inherit from her husband or retain custody
 of her children if her husband dies. The LNTG III and IV Governments and the
 Taylor administration did not sign a law passed by the legislature that would have
 ensured equal rights for women. There were very few programs to help any combat-
 ants reintegrate into society; and particularly, no programs especially designed to
 help former female combatants. The absence of special programs, however, was not
 discriminatory, but reflected the fact that there were few former female former com-
 batants. Several women's organizations, however, advanced family welfare issues,
 helped promote political reconciliation, and assisted in rehabilitating former combat-
 ants as well as civilians affected by the war.
 In Monrovia at the end of the year, a growing number of professional women's
 groups-including lawyers, marketeers, and businesswomen-became increasingly
 vocal about their concerns. Government officials often responded negatively to public
 criticism and there were reports of harassment and possible surveillance of out-
 spoken critics.
 Children.-Due to the poor condition of government schools, most children who at-
 tended school went to private institutions. However, many private schools had to
 be refurbished, which were largely destroyed during the April and May 1996 fight-
 ing since the Government decided not to pay private schools the subsidies that had
 been in effect before the war, school fees were drastically increased, thereby denying
 a large sector of the school-age population access to education. In both public and
 private schools, however, children were often asked to provide their own books,
 desks, copy books, pencils, and reams of paper.
 Denied a normal childhood during the civil war, Liberian youth were seriously vic-
 timized. An estimated 50,000 children were killed; of those wounded, orphaned, or
 abandoned, many witnessed terrible atrocities or committed atrocities themselves.
 Twenty-one percent (4,306) of the combatants who disarmed under the provisions
 of the Abuja II peace accord were child soldiers under the age of 17. As education
 and nurturing were almost completely disrupted, many children suffered post trau-
 matic stress disorder syndrome. Some are still addicted to drugs. It is estimated
 that 1A million children experienced violence, hunger, and homelessness during the
 war. The number of street children in Monrovia and the number of abandoned in-
 fants increased significantly following disarmament. NGO's and UNICEF continued
 retraining and rehabilitation programs for a limited number of former child fighters
 (see Section 6.d.).
 After a 2-year effort by the Association of Female Lawyers, a bill creating a juve-
 nile court system, enacted in 1959 and amended in 1971, was implemented in June.
 The new court system was limited to Monrovia and lacked the resources and person-
 
 
 191
 nel to function effectively. Children continue to be incarcerated with adults and
 there were long delays in deciding cases involving minors.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM) is widely condemned by international health ex-
 perts as damaging to both physical and psychological health. FGM traditionally has
 been peformedon young girls by northern, western, and central tribes, particularly
 in rural areas among traditional societies. Prior to the onset of the civil war in 1989,
 approximately 50 percent of women in rural areas between the ages of 8 and 18 un-
 derwent FGM. In some instances, female health professionals in the tribes partici-
 pated in thepractic to the extent of providing postoperative care. The war, how-
 ever, totally disrupted village life. The war caused most of the population to flee to
 neighboring countries or become internally displaced. Social structures and tradi-
 tional institutions, such as the secret soceties which often performed FGM as an
 initiation rite, were also undermined by the war. Most experts believe that the civil
 war has caused a reduction in FGM, estimating that the incidence has dropped to
 as low as 10 percent. The most extreme form of FGM, infibulation, is not practiced.
 The Government has taken no action against FGM.
 People With Disabilities.-The war produced a large number of people with per-
 manent injuries in addition to persons disabled from other causes. There is no legal
 discrimination against the disabled, but in practice they do not enjoy equal access
 to public buildings. There are no laws mandating accessibility to public buildings
 or services.
 Religious Minorities.-The law prohibits religious discrimination. However, some
 Muslims, who now represent a significant portion of the population, believe that Li-
 berian secular culture gives preference to Christianity in civic ceremonies and ob-
 servances, and that discrimination spills over into areas of individual opportunity
 and employment. Although there are some Muslims in senior government positions,
 many Muslims believe that they are bypassed for highly desirable government jobs.
 The Taylor administration dismissed many Muslims, particularly Mandingos, from
 longstanding jobs. Following President Taylor's public accusation in September that
 Muslim Mandingos were fighting in Sierra Leone, prominent Mandingos in Monro-
 via and elsewhere began receiving threats to their person and property from un-
 known individuals. Many Muslim business proprietors believe that the Taylor Gov-
 ernment's decision to enforce an old statute prohibiting businesses from opening on
 Sunday discriminates against them, as they celebrate their Sabbath on Friday and
 consequently are forced to close for the two most active selling days of the week.
 There were also credible reports that returning Muslim Mandingo refugees were not
 allowed to resettle in their home villages in Lofa, Bong, and Nimba Counties.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Although the Constitution bans ethnic dis-
 crimination, it also provides that only "persons who are negroes or of negro descent"
 may be citizens or own land, thus denying full rights to many people who were born
 or lived most of their lives in Liberia. There has been no governmental initiative
 to repeal this racial test. In September and October during the confirmation hear-
 ings for Taylor Government nominees, the issue of national and ethnic origins was
 widely debated, particularly for two cabinet nominees, of mixed Lebanese-Liberian
 parentage, and or one minister-designate who is a Muslim Mandingo, naturalized
 Liberian citizen.
 The 1975 economic "Liberianization" law prohibits foreign ownership of certain
 businesses, such as travel agencies, retail gasoline stations, and beer and soft-drink
 distributors. In October several bills extending the Liberianization law were passed
 by the legislature, but by year's end they had not been signed into law by the Presi-
 dent.
 Some members of former President Samuel Doe's ethnic group, the Krahn, believe
 that they were being systematically discriminated against by the Government, al-
 though there are some Krahn holding ministerial positions in the Government.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution states that workers, except mem-
 bers of the military and police, have the right to associate in trade unions. The Con-
 stitution also states that unions are prohibited from partisan political activity. Gov-
 ernment interference in union activities, especially union elections and leaderships
 conflicts, was commonplace both before and during the civil war.
 Although legal economic activity almost halted during the war, unions pro-
 liferated. Thirty-two functioning unions were loosely organized under two umbrella
 grups-the Federation of Liberian Trade Unions and the Congress of Liberian
 TradeUnions--with the common objective of protecting the rights of their 60,000
 members, who were largely unemployed. The actual power the unions exercised was
 extremely limited, as the country's work force is largely illiterate and the labor laws
 tend, in some respects, to favor management.
 
 
 The Constitution is silent on the right to strike, but labor laws protect this right.
 Due to the destruction of the economy and the continuing 85 percent unemployment
 rate, strikes were infrequent. On September 6, however, about 300 people dem-
 onstrated at the Bridgestone/Firestone rubber plantation in Harbel, Margibi county,
 demanding greater death and insurance benefits and immediate reemployment of
 more than 3,000 former employees. After ECOMOG troops fired warning shots into
 the air to disperse the crowd and the shots were ignored, ECOMOG moved to break
 up the demonstration, shooting six workers.
 During the year, neither the LNTG III, LNTG IV, nor the Taylor administration
 took discriminatory actions against organized labor. With the advent of each new
 administration, however, many workers were dismissed and replaced with political
 appointees. Unlike previous administrations, the Taylor Government reportedly dis-
 missed large numbers of Muslim Mandingos. The Taylor Government also strictly
 enforced the union registration requirements that had fallen into disuse during the
 war. Many civil servants had not been paid for almost a year; the Taylor adminis-
 tration paid most of them by the end of December.
 Liberia's status as a beneficiary of the trade preferences under the United States'
 generalized system of preference (GSP) program was suspended in 1990 as a result
 of the Doe Government's failure to take steps to provide internationally recognized
 worker rights.
 Labor unions traditionally have affiliated with international labor groups such as
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.-With the important exception
 of civil servants, workers (including employees of public corporations and autono-
 mous agencies) have the right to organize and bargain collectively. In the past,
 agreements were negotiated freely between workers and their employers without
 government interference. These rights were largely moot because of the lack of eco-
 nomic enterprise.
 There were no export processing zones. All were destroyed after the war started.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor, but even before the civil war this prohibition was widely ignored in rural
 areas where farmers were pressured into providing free labor on "community
 projects" that often benefited only local leaders. In many parts of the country, this
 practice continued. The proliferation of forced labor during the civil crisis by factions
 that used captured enemies declined dramatically with the conclusion of voluntary
 disarmament in February.
 The Constitution prohibits forced and bonded labor by children. There were credi-
 ble reports, however, that former combatants kidnaped former child soldiers who
 had been reunited with their families in order to use them for forced labor, pri-
 marily in illicit logging and mining operations.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Even be-
 fore the civil war, enforcement of the law prohibiting employment of children under
 age 16 during school hours in the wage sector was lax. In all areas of the country,
 particularly where there were no schools, small children continued to assist their
 parents as vendors in local markets or on the streets, to take care of younger broth-
 ers and sisters and to work on family subsistence farms. With few educational op-
 p ortunities and with rampant economic hardship, most children still worked to help
 eep their families alive.
 The Constitution prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, however, there
 were reports of its use (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor law provides for a minimum wage,
 paid leave, severance benefits, and safety standards, but the enforcement mecha-
 nism collapsed during the war and the Taylor administration did not make this a
 high priority issue. With the economy almost totally destroyed, citizens were forced
 to accept any work that they could find regardless of wages or working conditions.
 The 1977 Labor Law requires a minimum wage of approximately $.25 per hour not
 exceeding 8 hours per day, excluding benefits, for unskilled laborers. Agricultural
 workers are paid $1.50 for an 8 hour day, excluding benefits. Skilled labor has no
 minimum fixed wage, but industrial workers usually received three or four times
 the wage paid to agricultural workers. The Ministry of Labor did not have the re-
 sources to monitor compliance with the labor laws. In practice wages are paid in
 Liberian dollars which are worth less than three cents in U.S. currency. Even if
 both spouses work, the minimum wage is far less than a family needs to survive.
 Families dependent on minimum wage incomes also engage in subsistence farming,
 small scale marketing, petty extortion, and beggiag.
 The Labor Code provides for a 48-hour, 6-day regular workweek with a 30-minute
 rest period per 5 hours of work. The 6-day workweek may extend to 56 hours for
 service occupations and to 72 hours for miners, with overtime pay beyond 48 hours.
 
 
 193
 Prior to 1990, there also were government-established health and safety standards,
 enforced in theory by the Ministry of Labor. During the war, these regulations were
 not enforced. Even under the Labor Code, workers did not have a specific right to
 remove themselves from dangerous situations.
