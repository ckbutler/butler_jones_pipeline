 MOROCCO
 Morocco, which has existed as a political entity for some
 1200 years, is a constitutional monarchy ruled by Hassan
 II. The treaty of Fez (1912) made Morocco a protectorate
 of France; Spain subsequently assumed a protectorate
 position over the northern and southern zones. The
 Kingdom of Morocco recovered its political independence
 from France on March 2, 1956 following the 1955 return
 from exile of Mohammed V (venerated as the father of
 Moroccan independence) and Crown Prince Hassan. Hassan II
 succeeded his father to the throne in 1961. Spanish zones
 were restored incrementally to Morocco in 1956, 1958 and
 1969; two enclaves now remain under Spanish control.
 Morocco asserted its claims to the former Spanish Sahara
 in 1976 and has established administrative control over
 the territory, which is being disputed by the Polisario, a
 national liberation movement based in Algeria.
 The constitution, in detailing the responsibilities of the
 King as head of state, strongly reinforces his role as
 both secular and religious leader of Morocco. The
 constitution also provides for: -- a Prime Minister
 appointed by the King to be head of the government; -- a
 unicarmeral parliament (264 members elected for a six year
 term, two thirds of whom are directly elected by universal
 suffrage by citizens over age 20, the remaining one third
 indirectly elected by community councils and by business,
 labor and farmer groups); -- and an independent judicial
 structure of which the highest court is the supreme court
 (of appeals) whose judges are appointed by the King.
 Civil and criminal codes combine both French and
 traditional Islamic law.
 To reduce deficit spending, the government in May 1981
 raised the prices of heavily subsidized basic foodstuffs
 to a level nearer market prices. In objection, the
 Democratic Labor Confederation, (CDT - labor union, linked
 to the USFP - Union Socialist des Forces Populaires, the
 socialist party), called a general strike in June which
 degenerated into civil disorder in Casablanca and, to a
 lesser extent, in Rabat. Government forces were called in
 to restore order. In the ensuing confrontation, some
 reports allege that as many as several hundred people may
 have been killed. Among the victims were both civilians
 and police. Numerous arrests followed, together with
 trials of those accused of fomenting or of taking part in
 the disturbances.
 In September 1981 five members of the USFP politburo
 including top USFP leaders were arrested after
 distributing a communique criticizing the position taken
 on Western Sahara by King Hassan at the OAU summit meeting
 in August 1981. The government charged the five socialist
 leaders with disturbing public order. They were found
 guilty at a public trial fully covered by local and
 foreign journalists. Two received sentences of one year
 in prison; the other three received suspended sentences.
 The sentences have been appealed by the USFP.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 
 (1051)
 
 
 1052
 a. Torture
 In previous years there have been sporadic charges
 (including an allegation in 1980 by the Belgian
 Association of Jurists) that Moroccan prisoners were
 beaten and tortured. There is no corroboration of such
 abuses in 1980 or 1981. While there continue to be
 reports of intermittent instances of harsh interrogation
 methods by local law enforcement officials, the Government
 of Morocco does not condone such methods. Despite the
 large number of arrests after the June 20, 1981,
 disturbances in Casablanca and Rabat, no credible
 accusations of torture of those detainees have been
 registered.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment of Punishment
 Following a hunger strike in one Moroccan prison, an
 effort was made by Moroccan and European human rights
 activists to bring prison conditions and the state of
 health of some detainees to the attention of the
 government.   The Prime Minister and Minister of Justice
 in 1980 ordered an investigation of sanitary and health
 conditions at several Moroccan prisons. Subsequently, the
 government in March and July of 1980 announced the release
 of about 140 prisoners. There were no substantiated
 allegations of cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment in
 Moroccan prisons made in 1981. However, Amnesty
 International received reports that medical care for
 prisoners was inadequate. Amnesty International's 1981
 Report cited allegations of ill-treatment of several USFP
 activities arrested in January. Reportedly they showed
 the court marks on their bodies which they claimed were
 evidence of ill-treatment by the police. The court
 rejected their request for medical examinations to verify
 these claims.
 No allegations were made of discrimination among prisoners
 based on sex, race and nationality. Since 1973-1974, when
 approximately thirty persons were tried and executed for
 high treason and crimes against the state, no persons have
 been executed for crimes against the state.
 The government does not use exile as a punishment, but
 some political dissidents are in self-imposed exile. In
 August 1980, on the anniversary of Mohammed V's departure
 for exile, clemency was accorded to twenty-four Moroccans
 residing outside the country who were under sentence or
 for whom warrants had been issued.
 c. Disappearances
 While pretrial detention is common, ther is no credible
 evidence that Moroccans are abducted or secretly arrested
 or of clandestine detention by official or semi-official
 security forces.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 As many as several thousand Moroccans arrested or detained
 during the period after the coup attempts were military
 
 
 1053
 personnel tried in military tribunals. Many of those
 civilians implicated in the 1973 disturbances were held
 for prolonged periods without trial. However, the number
 of detainees was significantly reduced by trials, releases
 and amnesties between 1974 and 1980. Subsequent to the
 June 20, 1981, civil disorders in Casablanca and Rabat,
 1100 persons were reportedly arrested in Casablanca,
 nearly 100 in Rabat, and scores of others around the
 country. Included were members of the USFP and CDT
 charged with inciting to riot. The large majority of
 those arrested have been tried in open court proceedings.
 For those convicted, the sentences have ranged principally
 between one month and one year; in many cases the
 sentences were suspended. There were numerous allegations
 that the USFP and CDT detainees (especially those absent
 from the scene of the rioting and those not physically
 present in Casablanca and Rabat) were the subject of
 politically-motivated arrest and prosecution. The
 Moroccan government maintains that persons in these
 categories convicted of inciting to riot had been active
 in planning or creating the atmosphere in which the riots
 took-place.
 Another 100-odd young Moroccans were arrested and detained
 without trial in the spring of 1977 on charges of taking
 part in clandestine and subversive leftist activities.
 All but 14 have been released and they have undergone
 trial.
 Arrests under government regulations predating the present
 constitution in connection with April 1979 strikes were
 strongly criticized by the opposition.
 In September 1981 the five active members of the USFP
 Politburo were arrested after publishing a tract critical
 of the Nairobi II OAU meeting resolutions on the Western
 Sahara, to which the Moroccan government had acceded.
 Several, including USFP Secretary General Abderrahim
 Bouabid, were reported to have been arrested by police
 officials without required warrants.
 There are probably between 200 and 300 prisoners in
 Morocco who have been convicted of political crimes,
 approximately the same number as at the end of 1979. Not
 included in this estimate are many of those detained
 consequent to the June 20, 1981 disturbances in Casablanca
 and Rabat against whom there was evidence of their
 physical involvement in the disorders. Included in the
 estimate are a small number of USFP and CDT members given
 prison sentences although they were not shown to be near
 the scene of the disorders. About half of the present
 political prisoners were convicted in the highly
 publicized Casablanca trials of 1977.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Persons detained for anti-government activities since
 1972, including the USFP Politburo members arrested in
 September 1981 and those detained after the June 20, 1981
 riots in Casablanca and Rabat, have been tried in open
 court.
 The 1981 report of Freedom House stated that 'the rule of
 
 
 .1054
 
 law has been weakened by the frequent use of prolonged
 detention without trial."
 f. Invasion of the Home
 There have been sporadic press reports of intrusion into
 private homes by officials without observance of legal
 safeguards protecting individuals from arbitrary searches,
 but there is no evidence that this is a pervasive abuse.
 It is clear, however, that USFP Secretary General Bouabid
 was arrested from his home in September without a proper
 warrant.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These freedoms are all guaranteed under the 1972
 Constitution. Internal press censorship was lifted in
 1977. Criticism by the media of the administration,
 social conditions and all institutions (with the notable
 exceptions of the monarchy, Islam, and Morocco's claims to
 sjvereignty over the Western Sahara) is commonplace.
 While advance censorship is forbidden, distribution of
 publications containing articles critical of the monarchy
 has been occasionally prevented. Also, in the wake of the
 June 20, 1981 disorders, publication of the USFP's two
 organs ('Al Moharrir' and 'Liberation') was suspended
 because of their alleged use for incitement of violence.
 The two newspapers of the communist party (PPS-Party of
 Progress and Socialism) continue to be published on a
 daily basis and provide critical coverage of, inter alia,
 the trial and sentencing of the USFP leadership mentioned
 above. While foreign journals are available, the
 government occasionally prevents or inhibits the
 distribution of certain critical academic or artistic
 works.
 Article 6 of the constitution states that 'Islam is the
 religion of the state. The state guarantees the
 individual's freedom of worship.* Islam does not
 differentiate between church and state. Political,
 social, economic, and religious affairs are intertwined.
 While religious freedom from other faiths is guaranteed,
 proselytizing is not permitted. Despite Morocco's long
 history of religious toleration, large numbers of its
 Jewish community voluntarily left the country after the
 1967 and 1973 Arab-Israeli wars; about 20,000 remains in
 the country and the government has urged others to
 return. Relations with Christian churches are especially
 the Roman Catholic church, which ministers to some 100,000
 foreign residents, are cordial. While these churches are
 not permitted to proselytize, they have been encouraged to
 operate schools, hospitals and other institutions.
 The right of assembly is guaranteed in the constitution
 and elections were held in 1977 for local, provincial and
 national assemblies which are active.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Immigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is unrestricted throughout Morocco,
 
 
 1055
 
 except in those areas of the Western Sahara administered
 by Morocco which are contested by Polisario forces based
 in Algeria. Foreign travel for poltical reasons was
 sometimes restricted in years past, but is not now.
 However, persons without means of other influence
 frequently encounter delays in obtaining passports. Also,
 the difficulty in obtaining foreign currency imposes
 significant practical limitations on would-be travelers.
 There are no formal restrictions on emigration.
 Morocco encourages voluntary repatriation of members of
 the Moroccan Jewish community who voluntarily departed the
 country following the 1967 and 1973 Arab-Israeli wars.
 Members of the Saharan population who migrated to Algeria
 following the 1975 Spanish evacuation of the Western
 Sahara have also been encouraged to return to Morocco.
 Morocco has a policy of accepting refugees, although no
 large scale refugee population exists. The Moroccan
 government policy of political asylum follows Western
 European practices.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There is considerable opportunity for participation in
 Morocco's political life, given the diverse and
 well-organized groups now functioning. Suffrage is
 universal.
 The sense of national unity, purpose and commitment
 brought about in part by King Hassan II's 1975 call for
 the incorporation of the Western Sahara into the Moroccan
 state, provided, in large measure, sufficient stability to
 permit elections for local councils (1975) and a national
 legislature (1977) in accordance with prerogatives
 stipulated in the constitution and approved by National
 Referendum in 1972. There were elections for vacant
 parliamentary seats and for some 80 members to a newly
 formed consultative council for the Sahara.
 Five major political parties plus smaller groups have
 representatives elected to the national legislaturel the
 government coalition parties (the RNI-independents, the
 Constitutional Democrats, the Nationalist Istiqlal, and
 the Berber "Mouvement Populaire") and two opposition
 parties (the Socialist USPP and the Communist Party). For
 a time, the USFP threatened to withdraw from the session
 of parliament scheduled to convene in october 1981, but in
 a show of national unity, USFP members returned following
 the Polisario attack at Guelta Zemmour in the Western
 Sahara.
 Because of its involvement in the June 20 general strike
 call and its thinly veiled attack on the monarchy over the
 handling of the Western Sahara, the USFP's voice was
 somewhat muted in the latter months of 1981. The Moroccan
 communist party, however, openly and vigorously continues
 to criticize the government's policies in parliament, in
 local municipal councils and in its press. The 1980
 national referendum, which extended by two years the term
 of the legislature and extended the tenure of the
 presidency of the legislature from one to three years, was
 hotly contested by opposition parties, which had hoped to
 
 
 1056
 gain seats in the national elections that has been
 scheduled for 1981. The measure, however, passed easily.
 The constitution reaffirms the equality of all Moroccans
 before the law and specifically provides that *men and
 women enjoy equal political rights' and that "every
 citizen male and female, has the right to vote. . .
 While men and women in this Islamic society constitute
 largely separate subcultures, French education traditions
 have opened some doors to Moroccan women. Nevertheless,
 this partial liberalization is limited for the most part
 to urban areas, while the role of women in the
 predominantly rural and traditional Muslim environment
 remains restricted, as it has been over the centuries. No
 woman has ever held a cabinet position in Morocco, nor is
 there any woman in the 267 member parliament. There were,
 however, elected to the Saharan consultative council in
 voting which took place in the Western Sahara in August
 1981.
 The parliament has passed legislation protecting women's
 rights after divorce. The government, with support from
 the Agency for International Development, has also
 accelerated skills training and family planning projects
 designed to improve the position of women.
 The constitution guarantees to citizens the right to join
 trade unions and to unions the right to strike. The
 Moroccan Confederation of Trade Unions (UMT) is one of the
 oldest labor movements in Africa. Several union
 confederations, most notably the CDT (Conferation
 Democratique de Travail), are involved in labor activities
 in competition with the UMT.
 Strike activity by workers against their employing
 companies in 1981, as in the recent past, was conducted
 largely without government interference.
 In June 1981, the CDT called a general strike, promoted in
 the USFP press, to protest against the dramatic increases
 in the cost of government subsidized basic foodstuffs.
 This strike was partially observed (especially in
 Casablanca than in other parts of the country) on June 20
 and degenerated into arson, car-stoning, window-smashing,
 and urban rioting. The Moroccan government moved in
 'forces to restore order, and estimates of the number of
 deaths resulting from the confrontations range from 60-odd
 to over 600. Those accused of direct involvement and
 certain CDT and USFP leaders accused of instigating the
 disorders were subsequently arrested and tried in open
 court.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violation of
 Human Rights
 Morocco since 1974 has permitted outside groups to enter
 the country to investigate alleged human rights
 violations. The Moroccan government allowed foreign
 observers interested in human rights to observe the trials
 in July 1981 growing out of the June 10, 1981 civil
 disturbances in Casablanca and Rabat. One of the first to
 
 
 1057
 arrive in Morocco was Jean-Pierre Mignard, a French
 attorney who stayed in Morocco several days and upon
 leaving announced that 637 persons had been killed in
 Casablanca, most of them by police gun fire. The number
 cited by Mignard is one which has wide currency in
 USFP-CDT circles; however, the number has not been
 confirmed, nor was it a direct issue in the trials which
 he attended. After his departure, a group of five foreign
 lawyers arrived to observe the trials. One of the group
 told the assembled defense counsel at the Rabat'trials
 that he would go further in his investigations than
 Mignard had done. Evidently anxious lest the five lawyers
 use the trials as a backdrop for further statements like
 Mignard's, Morocco expelled the five from the country. An
 American representative of the International League for
 Human Rights and the Lawyers' Committee for International
 Human Rights was denied access to the trials# but was not
 expelled. There is no evidence, however, thateither
 local or foreign journalists were refused aocess to either
 the June 20-related trials or the USFP politburo
 proceedings, and there was full reporting of those events
 in both the local and foreign media.
 Two human rights associations, the League for the Defense
 of Human Rights (affiliated with the Istiqlal Party) and
 the Association for Human Rights (affiliated with the
 Socialist USFP) operate in Morocco. Partially due to the
 efforts of these two organizations, the government
 undertook in 1980 an investigation of health and sanitary
 conditions at several Moroccan prisons and subsequently
 released some 140 prisoners. The two organizations have
 consistently condemned all forms of human rights
 violations, and have repeatedly called for observance of
 rights refined in the Universal Declaration of Human
 Rights.
 Amnesty International has given special attention to
 imprisonment of prisoners of conscience and prolonged
 incommunicado   detention. In February 1981 Amnesty
 International sent a mission to Morocco to discuss its
 concerns with officials. The government has not granted
 the International Committee of the Red Cross access to
 captured Polisario combatants.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Because of Morocco's high population growth rate (about 3
 percent in 1981) and increasing life expectancy (from 51.9
 in 1978 to 56.4 years in 1981), it has been difficult for
 the government to provide sufficient social and
 educational facilities. It was estimated in 1976-79 that
 45 percent of the rural population and 28 percent of the
 urban population remained below the absolute poverty level.
 Morocco's 1981 central budget allocated dramatically
 increased amounts of funding to all four social sectors.
 Planned expenditures for education were up 60 percent over
 1980, health up 83 percent, funding agricultural projects
 up 93 percent, and housing 46 percent. Actual
 expenditures were lower due to lack of sufficient
 government revenues as a result of the economic downturn.
 The government continues to build new educational
 
 
 1058
 facilities throughout the country, particularly vocational
 institutes in the cities and primary schools in rural
 areas. Enrollment in primary schools increased over the
 last year, with an average of 72 percent of children or
 primary age in school, while secondary enrollment is
 growing faster. The most recent literacy rate estimate is
 28 percent as compared to 21 percent in 1970. An
 estimated 90 percent of boys and 54 percent of girls
 attend primary school for at least some period, a
 considerable improvement over the 67 and 35 percent
 figures in 1970.
 Several public health centers are under construction in
 rural areas, and a large moder university medical complex
 is being built in Casablanca. At the end of 1980, Morocco
 had approximately 23,000 hospital beds, or, one for every
 790 people. Both educational and health service programs,
 however, are hampered by management inefficiencies and
 inadequate professional and administrative staffing which
 has not kept up with the more rapid growth in physical
 plant. The government is endeavoring to rectify this
 problem in conjunction with bilateral and multilateral
 donors. Meanwhile, only 55 percent of Morocco's
 population had acess to safe water supply (only 25 percent
 in rural areas).
 To ensure adequate nutrition for the average Moroccan, the
 government subsidizes such basic staples as flour, bread,
 butter, cooking oils and sugar. The cost of maintaining
 subsidies on these staples would have grown to an
 estimated $600 million in 1981 had the subsidies not been
 reduced. The rise in prices after the sharp May reduction
 of consumer subsidies led to the June 20 civil
 disturbances in Casablanca, and the government quickly
 moved to reinstate half of the subsidies that had been
 eliminated. Caloric intake in 1980 was 105 percent of
 requirements, but the diet of the average Moroccan is
 heavily weighted to carbohydrates and rather low in
 protein.
 Women continue to make measurable strides in this
 conservative Islamic society. Overall enrollment of girls
 and women in the nation's educational instructions
 continue to grow rapidly, and females make up 38 percent
 of all primary school students, more than 40 percent of
 those in secondary schools, and 25 percent of university
 enrollees. Enrollment of women and girls in rural areas
 remains an exception, however. Although the government
 had made educational facilities available to a large
 percentage of rural females, traditional attitudes and
 religious precepts work against government efforts in this
 field. Employment opportunities for women continue to
 expand at least in the modern sector. The government
 makes particular efforts to train female workers.
 WESTERN SAHARA
 No conclusive information on the human rights situation in
 the Sahara provinces is available. Morocco has long
 claimed sovereignty over the former Spanish Sahara. With
 the withdrawal of the Spanish in 1975 and the signing of
 the Madrid Accords, Morocco established administrative
 
 
 1059
 control in the territory. Morocco's administration was
 extended to the southern third of the Western Sahara in
 1978 when Mauritania withdrew from the war and later
 signed a peace treary with the Polisario, the national
 liberation movement that is contesting Morocco's claim to
 the Western Sahara. Since 1976 the former Spanish Sahara
 has been increasingly integrated into the Moroccan
 polity. Municipal, provincial and parliamentary elections
 were held in the area controlled by Morocco in 1977 when
 polling took place throughout the country. Full communal
 elections were held in Oued Eddahab (southern one-third of
 the Sahara) on May 8, 1981. By-elections were held for
 vacant parliamentary seats on May 19, 1981. The level of
 voter participation for the four contested Saharan seats
 ranged from 76 to 93 percent (as opposed to 57-72 percent
 for by-elections held the same day in Morocco proper.)
 The native Moroccan Saharans occupying the ten seats in
 parliament allotted to the four Saharan provinces include
 the present secreatary of state (junior minister) for
 saharan affairs and two vice presidents of parliament. At
 least three other Saharans in parliament; two are directly
 elected from Tan-Tan province just north of the former
 Spanish Sahara (one of whom is President of Parliament Dey
 Ould Sidi Baba) and one, indirectly elected as trade union
 representative, speaks for the Posbucra workers. Three of
 the royally-appointed provincial governors are Saharan
 natives. In consultation with the elected municipal and
 provincial councils the four governors administer their
 Saharan provinces in the same manner as Morocco's 36 other
 provinces are governed. The Royal Armed Forces, a
 sizeable portion of which are stationed near Saharan
 towns, play no direct role in the civil administration.
 The governors are primarily concerned with the accelerated
 development of economic infrastructure and delivery of
 social services in the Sahara, a top priority of the
 national government to which disproportionate resources
 have been devoted.
 Morocco has agreed to cooperate with efforts of the
 Organization of African Unity (OAU) peacefully to resolve
 the Saharan conflict on the basis of a cease fire and
 referendum. Agreement was reached at the OAU heads of
 state summit held at Nairobi in August 1981 for a peace
 settlement in the Western Sahara. Under the terms of this
 agreement, Morocco agreed to the negotiation of a cease
 fire under OAU auspices and to international supervision
 of a referendum in the Sahara on the choice of
 independence or integration into Morocco. Full details on
 implementing the agreement remain to be worked out among
 the contending parties as well as with the UN.
