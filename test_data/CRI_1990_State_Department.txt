 COSTA RICA
 Costa Rica is a well-established democracy with separate
 executive, legislative, and judicial branches and a Supreme
 Electoral Tribunal considered.to be a fourth branch of
 government. Elections for president, two vice presidents, and
 57 deputies to a unicameral legislative assembly are held
 every 4 years. They have been consistently free and fair.
 Rafael Angel Calderon won the February 1990 presidential
 elections, in which approximately 80 percent of all eligible
 voters participated. The President is constitutionally barred
 from reelection for life. Members of the Legislative Assembly
 may be reelected, but only after an intervening term of office.
 The 1949 Constitution abolished Costa Rica'a standing army.
 Law enforcement and citizen protection are shared by the Civil
 Guard, the Crime Prevention Unit, and the Anti-Drug Police in
 the Ministry of Public Security; the Rural Guard and the
 Directorate of Narcotics and Intelligence in the Ministry of
 Government; the Directorate of Intelligence and Security in
 the Ministry of the Presidency; and the Judicial Police in the
 Supreme Court. The San Jose Metropolitan Police and the
 Ministry of Public Works and Transportation's Transit Police
 have limited functions. Public security forces generally
 observe procedural safeguards established by law and the
 Constitution and are under effective civilian control.
 Export-oriented businesses, both agricultural and light
 industrial, lead the Costa Rican economy. Steady economic
 growth of recent years continued during 1990 at a projected
 3-4 percent; growth in 1989 was 5.6 percent. Private
 enterprise accounts for more than 70 percent of the gross
 national product. The right to own private property is
 protected by the Constitution, although there have been delays
 in recent years in compensating foreign and Costa Rican owners
 for properties expropriated for incorporation .into nature
 protection or Indian reserves. There have also been squatter
 invasions of private property.
 Costa Ricans continue to enjoy a wide range of individual
 rights and freedoms. Complaints of human rights abuse, when
 they arise, tend to be in the area of de facto discrimination
 against blacks, Indians, and women, and also violence against
 women. The Government works diligently to try to ensure that
 basic rights and freedoms are accorded in practice to all
 Costa Ricans.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 The Government does not practice, abet, or condone political
 killing.
 In May, however, an immediate reaction unit unintentionally
 killed a 12-year-old boy during an antinarcotics raid. The
 Ministry of Public Security disbanded the unit shortly
 afterward. A special legislative commission found the unit
 had used excessive force and raised a question about the
 appropriatness of the training received by the unit from
 foreign law enforcement (including U.S.) specialists.

 COSTA RICA
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known or reported incidents of politically
 motivated abductions or secret arrests.
 C. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits cruel or degrading treatment and
 holds legally invalid any statement obtained through
 violence. These prohibitions are generally respected in
 practice, but allegations of police mistreatment are
 occasionally reported. Prisoners generally receive humane
 treatment, although there have been charges of mistreatment by
 prison guards. These charges can be taken up with the Special
 Defense Counsel for Prison Inmates, which investigates any
 such accusation. Serious cases are handled by the Office of
 the Chief Prosecutor (Ministerio Publico). Public concern
 about crowded penitentiaries and the availability of weapons
 in prisons is growing. Rioting occurred in several large
 prisons in 1990. One inmate was murdered by fellow prisoners
 in July. The Government announced it had earmarked funds to
 improve prison conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Judicial warrants are required for arrests, and an arraignment
 before a representative of the court must take place within 24
 hours of arrest. Article 48 of the Constitution entitles
 detained persons to a judicial determination of the
 detention's legality. These rights are generally respected,
 although persons charged with major offenses often remain in
 pretrial custody for-long periods. Approximately 40 percent
 of those currently in prison have yet to be tried.
 The right to bail is provided for in law and observed in
 practice. Bail is sometimes-denied to repeat offenders;
 however, and is usually denied to foreigners on the assumption
 that they would leave the country before coming to trial. A
 provision of a 1988 drug law, upheld by the Supreme Court,
 allows denial of bail to accused drug offenders. Generally,
 detainees will not be held incommunicado. With judicial
 authorization, however, suspects may be held for 48 hours
 after arrest, or, under special circumstances, for up to 10-
 days. The judiciary is generally effective in ensuring that
 legal and constitutional safeguards are observed.
 The Constitution bars exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is independent and assures a fair public trial.
 The Supreme Court supervises the work of the lower courts.
 Its 24 magistrates are elected by the Legislative Assembly to
 8-year terms.* Accused persons may select their own attorneys;
 access to counsel is guaranteed and honored in practice. The
 State provides legal counsel to those who cannot afford an
 attorney. There is no imprisonment for political offenses.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, .Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no reported instances during 1990 of extralegal
 invasions of-privacy conducted by, or with the knowledge of,
 the Government. Judicial warrants are required to search
 private homes, and police generally comply.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Cons.titution specifically provides for freedom of speech
 and press, which is generally respected in practice. There
 are 9 private newspapers, 6 private television stations, 1
 public and 79 private radio stations. The media freely
 criticize the Government, and there is no evidence of
 self-censorship or governmental intimidation, but a stringent
 libel law makes the media cautious.
 In 1983 the conviction of a U.S. journalist for violating a
 1969 law requiring licensing by the journalists' guild was
 upheld by the Supreme Court. A 1985 advisory opinion of the
 Inter-American Court of Human Rights declared the law
 incompatible with the Inter-American Human Rights Convention.
 However, the Arias government publicly supported the law, and
 there were two additional convictions, resulting in suspended
 prison sentences and fines, in 1989. In 1990 unlicensed
 foreign correspondents in Costa Rica were harassed by police
 for brief periods. By year's end the Calderon Government had
 not yet taken a position on the law.
 Limits are placed on films, plays, and television shows by an
 Office of Censorship and a Censorship Tribunal. The former
 rate6, films and has authority to prohibit their showing; it
 has similar powers over television and plays. The Tribunal
 reviews appeals of the Office's actions.
 In 1989 the censor's office banned-the film "The Last
 Temptation of Christ." An association of law students brought
 the case to the Attorney General's Ombudsman for Human Rights,
 which overturned the ban in November 1989. The acting
 Attorney General rescinded that decision in January 1990. At
 year's end the case was pending before the constitutional
 chamber of the Supreme Court.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Constitutional provisions for freedom of assembly and
 association are fully respected. Permits required for parades
 or similar large-scale gatherings are granted routinely; they
 are not required for other public meetings.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is protected by the Constitution and
 generally observed in practice, although Roman Catholicism is
 the official state religion. The Constitution stipulates that
 the President must be a layman. Foreign missionaries and
 clergy of all denominations work and proselytize freely.
 Costa Ricans affiliated with non-Catholic groups claim,
 however, that non-Catholic churches are required to comply
 
 
 COSTA RICA
 with building codes from which Catholic churches are exempt.
 These groups are seeking remedial legislation.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no unusual restrictions on travel within the country
 or abroad, and both citizens and foreigners are free to live
 anywhere within the national boundaries. Neither emigration
 nor a citizen's right of return is restricted. Costa Rica
 supports multinational refugee programs and has accepted many
 refugees from Central and South America. Many Nicaraguan
 refugees have begun voluntarily repatriating following the
 April 1990 change of government in Managua. The Constitution
 specifically prohibits repatriation of anyone subject to
 political persecution. Political asylum traditionally has
 been granted to exiled dissidents of various political
 orientations.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Costa Ricans choose their government through free, open, and
 competitive elections. The integrity of elections is ensured
 by the independent Supreme Electoral Tribunal, and election
 results are respected. The Legislative Assembly can and does
 reject executive branch initiatives. Citizens can and do
 petition for legislative redress and assistance with
 government bureaucracies. The ruling Social Christian Unity
 Party and the opposition National Liberation Party control 29
 and 25 seats, respectively, in the 57-member Legislative
 Assembly. A Communist Party member holds one seat. Two
 independent provincial parties hold one seat each.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 A 1984 Executive Order created the office of Ombudsman for
 Human Rights, now housed in the Ministry of Justice, which
 hears complaints from individuals about human rights abuses.
 A similar office considers complaints concerning the
 penitentiary system. Three nongovernmental groups monitor and
 report on human rights in Costa Rica: the Costa Rican
 Commission for Human Rights, the Commission for the Defense of
 Human Rights in Central America, and the Family and Friends of
 Political Prisoners of Costa Rica.
 Costa Rica has traditionally been a strong supporter of
 international and private human rights organizations. The
 Inter-American Institute of Human Rights has its headquarters
 in San Jose.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Costa Rica's population includes some 24,000 indigenous
 people. Most live in traditional communities on 21 reserves
 that, in part because of their remote location, have
 inadequate schools, health care, electricity, and potable
 water. Indigenous people participate in the management of
 their own affairs through a National Indian Commission
 (CONAI). According to CONAI, about 20 percent of the
 
 
 565
 COSTA RICA
 indigenous people are undocumented and so lack proof of
 citizenship. In the 2,000-member Guaymi group, the figure
 increases to 70 percent. Lack of documentation prevents
 voting or running for office and makes it difficult to obtain
 credit. The Guaymis publicly protested their status early in
 1990. Remedial legislation was pending in the Legislative
 Assembly at year's end.
 The role of women, although still primarily domestic, is
 legally unrestricted. Women and men are generally paid
 equally for equal work. A Women's Defense Counsel has been
 established to work with various government agencies to
 protect women's rights and offer women advice and information
 on how to fight against sexual discrimination. During 1990
 the press reported on a disturbing rate of violent crime
 against women, raising the level of public awareness of the
 problem. Physical abuse of women, including domestic
 violence, is prosecuted and often results in stringent
 penalties. Abuse of female minors is considered aggravated
 assault. There are a number of groups that monitor abuse of
 women and provide counseling.
 Costa Rica's-30,000 blacks, who reside largely on the
 Caribbean coast, enjoy full rights of citizenship, including
 the protection of laws against racial discrimination. The
 1990-1994 Legislative Assembly includes one black member, as
 did the last. The Government treats all matters of racial
 discrimination as human rights issues and has established the
 Defense Counsel for Human Rights to deal with these and other
 such issues.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a, The Right of Association
 .Workers are free to join unions of their choosing without
 prior authorization. Approximately 15 percent of the work
 force is organized. Unions are independent of government
 control and are free to form federations and to maintain
 relations with recognized international bodies such as the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU).
 The. American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial
 Organizations (AFL-CIO), the ICFTU, and other trade union
 organizations contend that the "Solidarismo" movement in Costa
 Rica, an alternative to traditional trade unionism, creates
 "company unions" and that it is supported by the Government as
 an alternative to independent trade unionism. "Solidarismo"
 leaders reply that it is a legitimate form of employee
 organization which does not interfere with traditional union
 activities. At the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association
 (CFA) Conference in Geneva in June 1989, the ICFTU filed a
 formal complaint against the Government, alleging that it
 supports the "Solidarismo" movement in violation of Convention
 87. In July 1990, the CFA ruled that the decline of trade
 unionism in Costa Rica is connected with the development of
 "solidarista" associations.
 When strikes or other labor disputes occur in San Jose, a
 Labor Tribunal seeks a settlement. Ministry of Labor
 inspectors handle disputes outside the capital. If these
 efforts fail, the dispute goes to a labor court, which decides
 if the strike is legal.
 
 
 566
 COSTA RICA
 Although public sector employees are legally prohibited from
 striking, they strike with some frequency. Fines imposed on
 them are usually dropped as part of the strike settlement.
 Strikes and labor unrest declined somewhat in 1990. Two of
 the most significant strikes were by public school teachers
 and Ministry of Agriculture workers. The former sought
 salaries commensurate with those of other civil servants, the
 latter payment of increases won in previous negotiations but
 not paid. The teachers won a 50-percent pay raise. Labor
 courts decided in favor of the Ministry workers. Brief work
 stoppages were held by most public sector employees in July to
 protest the Government's economic adjustment measures.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize is protected by the Constitution and is
 observed in practice. There have been charges, however, that
 successive governments have been unresponsive to antiunion
 discrimination in the private sector.
 Labor leaders claim that the 1943 labor code is outdated and
 unjust. They cite in particular a clause permitting workers
 to be discharged for "any other grave fault" not specified
 elsewhere in the code as a mechanism to fire labor
 organizers. The Arias administration showed interest in
 revising the code in 1989 but, in the face of private sector
 and press opposition, did not persist.
 Labor regulations in nine export processing zones do not
 differ from those in the rest of the economy, either in law or
 in practice.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsdry Labor'
 The Constitution prohibits forced or compulsory labor and
 there are no known instances of either.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Constitution provides special employment protection for
 women and minors and establishes the minimum working age at 12
 years, with special regulations for workers under 15. A child
 welfare agency, in cooperation with the Labor Ministry, is
 responsible for enforcement. Although data is lacking, child
 labor appears to be an integral part of the large informal
 economy, which is effectively outside government regulation.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Constitution sets the workday hours, remuneration of
 overtime, days of rest, and annual vacation rights. It
 ,equires compensation for discharge without due cause and the
 right to a minimum wage. A national wage board, composed of
 three members each from government, management, and labor,
 sets minimum wages and salaries for all sectors.  While
 violations sometimes occur, these wage and salary levels are
 generally respected. The minimum wage ranges from about $200
 to $400 per month, depending on the occupation. Workers at
 the low end of this wage scale find it difficult to maintain a
 minimally acceptable standard of living. An August study by
 the Ministry of Planning found that, at current minimum wage
 levels, about 97"percent of a worker's pay is spent on food.
 
 
 567
 COSTA RICA
 Normal work hours are set at 8 hours for daytime and 6 hours
 for nighttime work, with weekly totals of 48 and 36 hours,
 respectively. Ten-hour days are permitted for work not
 considered unhealthful or dangerous, but weekly totals may not
 exceed 48 hours. Nonagricultural workers receive an overtime
 premium of 50 percent of regular wages for work in excess of
 the daily work shift. Agricultural workers are not paid
 overtime, however, if they work beyond their normal hours
 voluntarily; there is little evidence that employers coerce
 such overtime from employees.
 A 1967 law governs health and safety at the workplace. This
 law requires industrial, agricultural, and commercial firms
 with 10 br more workers to establish a management-labor
 committee. The law allows the Government to inspect workplaces
 and to fine employers for violations. There are too few labor
 inspectors, however, especially outside of San Jose, to ensure
 that minimum conditions of safety and sanitation are
 maintained.
