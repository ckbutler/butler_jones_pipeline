 ESTONIA
 Estonia was an independent state between the two World Wars
 but was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 as a constituent
 republic of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.).
 The United States does not recognize the forcible incorporation
 of Estonia into the U.S.S.R.
 Like the other Baltic states, Estonia is generally subjected
 to the same centralized rule, the same constitution and
 judicial system, and the same restrictions on civil and
 political liberties as in the Soviet Union. Nevertheless,
 taking advantage of the policies of "glasnost'" (openness) and
 "perestroika" (restructuring) adopted by General Secretary
 Mikhail Gorbachev, Estonians in 1988 became outspoken in
 expressing their resentment of Soviet policy in Estonia and in
 demanding national, civil, and human rights. This burgeoning
 activity culminated in the declaration in November by the
 Estonian Supreme Soviet (parliament) that its laws superseded
 those of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet. It also passed laws
 emphasizing its control over all areas except defense and
 foreign policy. The Presidium of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet
 rejected the Estonian legislature's actions as inconsistent
 with the Soviet Constitution.
 Concerned about the survival of Estonia as a distinct nation,
 the Estonian Supreme Soviet voted to make Estonian the
 language of Estonia and to legalize the flag of independent
 Estonia. Because of a low birthrate and an official
 settlement policy that has resulted in an influx of
 non-Estonian settlers, the ethnic Estonian proportion of the
 total population has dropped from 92 percent in 1939 to
 approximately 60 percent. Estonian organizations in 1988
 pressed for a policy to discourage or stop such an influx.
 The standard of living in Estonia is higher than the Soviet
 average, but the margin is shrinking. Estonians resent the
 fact that too much of the national income they generate is
 transferred to other republics and that most major economic
 enterprises are directly controlled by central ministries
 located in Moscow. They also complain of the declining
 quantity and quality of food supplies and consumer goods. The
 Soviet Politburo in April decided to grant Estonia more
 autonomy over a portion of its economy, but neither the extent
 nor the forms of local control were made clear.
 The human rights situation in Estonia improved markedly during
 1988. Although some human rights violations by the Soviet
 authorities continued, particularly against advocates of
 independence for Estonia, unprecedented public expressions of
 Estonian national sentiment and independent political views
 were tolerated by the authorities in 1988. The People's Front
 in Support of Perestroika, a political movement that included
 many leaders of the Estonian Communist Party and Government,
 was founded in October and became very active. Changes in the
 Soviet legal code, which could affect some laws and
 regulations used to repress legitimate political activity,
 remained under discussion but were not implemented during 1988.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reported cases of political killing in 1988.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known instances of permanent or prolonged
 disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 In Estonia, as in the Soviet Union, cruel and inhuman
 treatment of prisoners occurs during both. interrogation and
 confinement in labor camps, prisons, or psychiatric
 hospitals. Physical and psychological abuse of prisoners is
 common, as is detention under extremely unhealthful
 conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Soviet laws are written and interpreted so broadly that
 persons may be arrested and convicted for trying to exercise
 their basic human rights. During 1988 the authorities rarely
 used these laws to arrest political activists, so that the
 ability of Estonians to express their views and to criticize
 the Governments in both Tallinn and Moscow improved
 significantly. Nevertheless, a number of persons were
 detained in February for participating in various
 demonstrations. Most were released almost immediately, but
 Sivert Zoldins was detained for distributing leaflets on
 February 2 and held without trial until he was released in
 July. Former political prisoner Heno Ahonen and several
 other human rights activists left Estonia in early 1988 under
 pressure from the authorities, including threats of criminal
 prosecution. Such threats and pressures were rarely used
 during the latter part of 1988, according to human rights
 activists, although some advocates of Estonian independence
 were questioned by the authorities about the formation of the
 Estonian National Independence Party. At year's end, there
 were no reports that anyone had been arrested for political
 reasons in the latter part of 198a.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Despite provisions for judicial objectivity in both the
 Estonian and Soviet Constitutions, the State completely
 controls the judicial process and, in political cases,
 arbitrarily decides the outcome of all trials to suit its
 requirements. No rights of a defendant override the
 compelling "interests of the State." Some Estonian public
 figures spoke out in 1988 for strengthening the rights of
 defendants in Soviet trials, but it is as yet unclear whether
 or how such reforms might be implemented. There were no known
 convictions on purely political charges in 1988. Political
 prisoners Mart Niklus and Enn Tarto, both sentenced in the
 early 1980's to 10 years' imprisonment and 5 years' internal
 
 
 1038
 ESTONIA
 exile on charges of "anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda,"
 were released and allowed to return to Estonia in 1988.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Government interference in personal life is pervasive through
 the use of informers, mail censorship and confiscation,
 electronic monitoring of telephones, and other means. Contacts
 between Estonians and visitors from foreign countries continue
 to be monitored, but the authorities facilitated a considerable
 increase in such contacts during 1988. It is not clear whether
 interference with mail and telephonic communications diminished
 during the year, but Estonians seem less fearful about using
 these means of communications to express their views.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for most internationally accepted
 political liberties on condition that their exercise does not
 threaten the security of the Socialist system. The Estonian
 Supreme Soviet voted on November 16 to amend the first article
 of the Estonian Constitution to include the provisions of the
 United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well
 as other internationally recognized international human rights
 instruments, as "an inseparable part of the legal systen of
 the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic." Unlike most other
 constitutional amendments adopted on November 16, this
 provision was not declared by the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet's
 Presidium to be inconsistent with the Soviet Constitution.
 In practice, the authorities interpret these constitutional
 guarantees to fit the convenience of the State. While
 glasnost' has expanded the ability of official and unofficial
 writers to explore heretofore taboo subjects and to spotlight
 economic and social problems, these opportunities are still
 subject to self-censorship and to limits which have not been
 stabilized or defined. Over the course of 1988, these limits
 appeared to expand considerably both with regard to personal
 expression and to the range of items appearing in the official
 press.
 In June the formerly banned flag of the independent Estonian
 republic was officially proclaimed by the Estonian Supreme
 Soviet to be the Estonian national flag. For the first time
 since the Soviet occupation of Estonia in 1940, Estonian print
 and electronic media carried frank discussions of Estonian
 history and Estonia's status as a Soviet republic. The 1939
 Molotov-Ribbentrop Nonaggression Pact between Nazi Germany and
 the Soviet Union, together with the secret protocols that
 became the basis for the Soviet occupation and annexation of
 the three Baltic states, were published in the Estonian press
 for the first time in 1988.
 Estonian radio provided live coverage of the founding congress
 of the Estonian People's Front held in October, at which
 several speakers strongly criticized the Communist Party's
 monopoly on power and the role of the Soviet military in
 Estonia. The official press published numerous documents and
 resolutions of the People's Front, the Council of Estonian
 Cultural Unions, and a youth forum, which called for human
 rights, self-determination, and a multiparty system. The
 media provided extensive coverage of ecological issues, and at
 
 
 1039
 ESTONIA
 least two papers reported on a demand by the "Green" movement
 for the resignation of the Prime Minister.
 In general, however, criticism of the party leadership and
 demands for Estonian independence are still considered by most
 journalists to be off-limits. Virtually all Estonian
 newspapers, magazines, journals, and books remained under the
 control of the Communist Party, although the newly organized
 People's Front published a bulletin that was reportedly not
 censored by the authorities. Knowledgeable observers report
 that the Estonian-language media were much more forthright
 than the Russian-language-media in reporting on social and
 political developments in Estonia, especially during the first
 half of 1988.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The peaceful assembly of citizens is controlled by the
 authorities, who retain the power to prohibit public
 gatherings. Basic guidelines concerning the authorization and
 holding of demonstrations and meetings are contained in a July
 28, l188, decree of the Presidium of the U.S.S.R. Supreme
 Soviet. Unlike other Soviet republican legislative bodies,
 however, the Estonian Supreme Soviet declined to adopt
 implementing legislation on the model of the Russian Soviet
 Federated Socialist Republic. Estonian Communist leaders also
 publicly stated that they saw no need to implement another
 U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet decree, providing for the use of
 special Ministry of Internal Affairs troops to quell public
 disorders.
 When the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet confirmed these decrees of
 its Presidium--on demonstrations and on the use of special
 internal affairs troops--a deputy from Estonia made an
 unprecedented speech in opposition to the decrees. Deputies
 from Estonia were among a handful of Supreme Soviet deputies
 who voted against confirmation of the decrees, the first time
 in recent history that the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet did not act
 "unanimously.*
 In practice, the people of Estonia were allowed to hold the
 largest mass meetings and demonstrations in recent Estonian
 history as the authorities' approach to such gatherings
 evolved over the course of 1988. The authorities reacted with
 hostility to a February 2 demonstration in Tartu to
 commemorate the 1920 peace treaty between the Soviet Union and
 independent Estonia in which the Soviet Union renounced any
 territorial claims against Estonia. Leading participants of
 that demonstration were subsequently pressured to leave
 Estonia. Tallinn demonstrations to mark the 70th anniversary
 of Estonian Independence Day (February 24) and the March 25
 anniversary of Stalinist deportations from Estonia were also
 mbt with some harassment from the authorities.
 The situation was considerably different, however, when the
 People's Front organized a mass meeting on June 17 at the
 Tallinn song festival grounds to discuss the Estonian
 delegation's platform for the XIXth Soviet Communist Party
 Conference. Over 100,000 people gathered peacefully, with the
 cooperation and support of the authorities, and the meeting
 was attended by Estonian delegates to the party conference.
 Several thousand Estonians also gathered peacefully in Tallinn
 August 23 to commemorate the 49th anniversary of the Molotov-
 Ribbentrop Pact at a meeting organized by the People's Front
 and at a separate demonstration organized by independent
 
 
 1040
 ESTONIA
 associations including the Estonian National Independence
 Party. As many as 300,000 people reportedly converged for a
 festival of patriotic songs and an outpouring of national
 political expression under the sponsorship of the People's
 Front on September 11.
 The People's Front held its own officially sanctioned founding
 congress on October 1-2, attended by more than 3,000 delegates
 from Estonia as well as political activists from various parts
 of the Soviet Union and hundreds of Soviet and foreign
 journalists. Throughout the summer and early fall, members of
 the Estonian National Independence Party and other human
 rights activists maintained a regular picket and information
 post in front of the Tallinn Supreme Court building to demand
 the release of political detainee Sivert Zoldins and long-term
 political prisoners Mart Niklus and Enn Tarto. The picketers
 initially encountered some harassment and official press
 criticism, but they were not prevented from carrying out their
 activities. The authorities eventually met the picketers'
 demands, first by releasing Zoldins in July and subsequently
 by freeing Niklus and Tarto in the early fall.
 The Constitution provides for the right to associate in public
 organizations, but this right has been limited by legislation
 and practice. There was some harassment of human rights
 activists, religious nonconformists, and independence
 advocates early in the year. Later, the authorities tolerated
 the activities of a wide range of unofficial groups. While
 exercising control over the official mass organizations, the
 authorities acquiesced in the rapid growth and development of
 the Estonian People's Front as an independent political
 organization. The Estonian Supreme Soviet voted November 16
 to add several references to the role of "social movements"
 such as the People's Front to the Estonian Constitution.
 These provisions were not challenged by the Presidium of the
 U.S.S.R.'s Supreme Soviet when it declared other Estonian
 constitutional amendments to be inconsistent with the Soviet
 Constitution.
 While many leaders and members of the People's Front are in
 the Communist Party, the People's Front maintains that it is
 not subordinate to the party and that it has some 100,000
 members. It has taken stands on many issues which differ from
 official party positions. It called for Socialist democracy
 and pluralism, political and economic sovereignty for Estonia,
 cultural autonomy, and the protection of citizens' rights.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Soviet Constitution provides for the right to
 profess, or not to profess, any religion, both the party and
 Government promote atheism. As in the Soviet Union, the
 regime adopted a less confrontational posture toward organized
 religion in 1988 than in previous years. For the first time
 in the postwar period, Christmas was celebrated in Estonia as
 an officially sanctioned holiday. The Archbishop's Christmas
 eve service at the Tallinn cathedral was shown on Estonian
 television. There were indications that new Soviet legislation
 may ease some restrictions on religious associations, and that
 the Estonian authorities may adopt separate legislation which
 takes account of local conditions.
 
 
 1041
 ESTONIA
 Despite the regime's more tolerant attitude toward religious
 believers, Lutheran and other pastors were nevertheless called
 in for questioning about activities related to political or
 nationalist causes. The authorities did not cease their
 efforts to harass and suppress numerous unregistered Baptist,
 Pentecostalist, and other religious groups, including members
 of the small "Word of Life" church. At least two religious
 believers were imprisoned because of their refusal to perform
 military service.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is neither guaranteed by law nor respected
 in practice. The right to emigrate by choice is not
 recognized by Soviet law. Travel abroad for family
 reunification or family visits is limited by restrictive
 legislation and arbitrary enforcement, although bureaucratic
 procedures seem to be less cumbersome in Estonia than in the
 qoviet Union as a whole. Many Soviet Jews in Estonia were
 reportedly denied permission to emigrate in previous years,
 and the vast majority of Estonians are still not even allowed
 to apply.
 Nonetheless, the upsurge in Soviet Jewish emigration has had a
 positive effect on Jewish emigration from Estonia as well. A
 number of Pentecostalists were also granted permission to
 emigrate. The number of Estonians allowed to visit relatives
 and friends in the United States, and the number of United
 States citizens formerly residing in Estonia who were allowed
 to return as visitors rose considerably. Several Estonian
 activists, including former political prisoner Heino Ahonen,
 were encouraged to depart Estonia for the West under pressure
 from the authorities.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The people of Estonia, as those of the Soviet Union, are not
 free to change government leaders or the system of
 government. For the first time in recent Estonian history,
 however, Soviet authorities were prepared to tolerate a great
 deal of political activity conducted outside the framework of
 the Communist Party. The most striking example of such
 activity was the development of the People's Front, which
 quickly attained semiofficial status and qualified endorsement
 from the party leadership. A small group of former political
 prisoners and other activists, many of whom had previously
 been active in the Group for the Publication of the
 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in Estonia, were also able to form an
 Estonian National Independence Party.
 Early in 1988, many Estonians outside the Communist Party
 began to articulate proposals for Estonian "sovereignty,"
 economic autonomy, Estonian citizenship, and official
 recognition of Estonian as the state language. At the time,
 the Estonian Communist leadership opposed such proposals and
 vigorously attacked the upsurge in glasnost'. Even in the
 absence of democratic political institutions, popular
 discontent played a role in the June replacement of the
 Communist Party First Secretary in Estonia. New First
 Secretary Vaino Valjas was quick to adopt many proposals which
 had originally put forward by groups and individuals from
 outside the party structure. Popular opposition to former
 Estonian Prime Minister Bruno Saul, including the "Green"
 
 
 1042
 ESTONIA
 movement's publicly stated demands for Saul's resignation,
 almost certainly played a role in Saul's November replacement
 by former Communist party ideology Secretary Indrek Toome.
 The stated goals of party leaders are to enhance Estonia's
 political and economic "sovereignty" within the structure of
 the Soviet Union, to enhance the role of Estonian as the
 official language of the republic, and to establish some form
 of Estonian citizenship. The leadership also claims that it
 would like to see a stronger role for elected government
 bodies, including local and republic soviets (councils), and
 they have not ruled out the possibility of nonparty candidates
 for government offices.
 In a culmination of such efforts, the Estonian Supreme Soviet
 in November declared the supremacy of its laws over those of
 the U.S.S.R. It amended its laws and Constitution so as to
 control its land, resources, banks, enterprises, and housing.
 It also passed laws to exercise control in all areas except
 defense affairs and foreign policy. The U.S.S.R. Supreme
 Soviet retorted that the Estonian legislature's actions were
 inconsistent with the U.S.S.R. Constitution. In December the
 Estonian Supreme Soviet amended the Estonian Constitution to
 make Estonian the official language of the Republic. Amid an
 intense debate between representatives of the Estonian and
 Russian-speaking populations, the Supreme Soviet deferred
 consideration of a more detailed language law until 1989.
 Women, in general, do not play a large role in the Estonian
 Communist Party or in political activities. Two exceptions
 are Marju Lauristin, a leader of the People's Front, and Lagle
 Parek, a leader of the Estonian National Independence Party.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Soviet Government has adopted a more forthcoming approach
 to foreign criticism of its human rights record, acknowledging
 problems and stating the desire to make Soviet society more
 "humane." It has also acknowledged that human rights are a
 legitimate subject of official multilateral and bilateral
 contacts.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or other grounds is
 prohibited in the Constitution. Tensions between ethnic
 Estonians and Russians are always near the surface in Estonia,
 and in 1988 these tensions were expressed in public debate
 over a number of issues. Ethnic Estonians increasingly
 expressed their concern that they are subjected to
 discrimination in their own homeland. They complained that
 they could not always conduct business in their own language
 and that "migrants" from the Soviet Union receive favored
 treatment in the provision of housing and other social
 services.
 Fundamentally, Estonians also voiced their concern that
 important decisionsaffecting Estonia's economy and ecology
 were been made by Estonians themselves. These concerns led to
 the proposals, accepted by Estonian Communist Party leaders,
 to make Estonian the official language, to establish criteria
 for Estonian citizenship, to take measures to discourage
 
 
 1043
 ESTONIA
 immigration, and to move toward full economic autonomy. Some
 Estonians also suggested that economic and other incentives
 should be offered to encourage "re-migration" of non-Estonians
 to the Soviet Union.
 Ethnic Russians and other Russian-speaking residents of
 Estonia were generally concerned by proposals for Estonian
 language and citizenship laws, fearing that they would be
 disenfranchised or converted into second-class citizens. They
 were also concerned by mass outpourings of Estonian national
 sentiment and the rapid rise of the People's Front, whose
 membership is predominantly ethnic Estonian. Russian speakers
 already complain that it is not always possible to conduct
 their business in Russian, and they argue that it would be
 unrealistic to institute the use of the Estonian language in
 cities such as Narva, which have an overwhelmingly Russian
 population. Some Russian residents of Estonia formed an
 "International Movement," calling for establishment of both
 Russian and Estonian as official language. of Estonia and
 opposing many of the positions favored by the People's Front.
 Some Russian workers in Estonia tried to strike in protest
 against Estonian national sentiment, but the effort was not
 successful. A planned November 15 strike at Tallinn's large
 All-Union factory, encouraged by the factory directors
 themselves to protest growing Estonian national activism,
 failed to materialize when both Russian and Estonian workers
 refused to participate.
 In response to debates between ethnic Estonians and the
 Russians, which were characterized by the circulation of
 rumors and inflammatory leaflets, the People's Front organized
 a "forum of peoples" in September. The forum brought together
 representatives of various ethnic groups in Estonia and
 adopted statements calling for "cultural autonomy" for
 Estonia's minority populations. Despite such efforts,
 however, ethnic tensions remained significant.
 Women nominally enjoy the same legal rights as men, and an
 extensive system of day-care service and maternity benefits
 assists women in obtaining and retaining jobs. In general,
 however, women hold less remunerative positions than do men in
 the same professions.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Soviet labor law and practice are enforced in Estonia. There
 is no right of association as defined by the International
 Labor Organization. Although the Constitution grants Soviet
 citizens the right to form trade unions, any attempt to
 exercise this right independently of the state-controlled
 unions is repressed. Workers do not have the right to strike,
 and past attempts to call strikes at state enterprises have
 been denounced by local officials.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers in Estonia may not organize or resort to collective
 bargaining. There are no economic incentive zones or special
 industries in which labor standards differ from those
 elsewhere in Estonia.
 
 
 1044
 ESTONIA
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Most prisoners are confined to camps where they are forced to
 labor, often under harsh and degrading conditions.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The statutory minimum age for employment of children is 16,
 and the standard workweek is 40 hours. There is no indication
 of widespread violations of these norms.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Labor conditions in Estonia are similar to those in the Soviet
 Union. According to the Soviet State Statistical Committee,
 the average monthly wage in the U.S.S.R. for blue- and white-
 collar workers in mid-1988 was $350 and for collective farm
 workers $250 at the official rate of exchange. The minimum
 monthly wage in the U.S.S.R. was $132. (The ruble is not a
 convertible currency, and its value here in terms of the U.S.
 dollar does not represent actual pruchasing power for
 international purposes.) Although specific information is not
 available, average wages in Estonia are believed to be higher
 than average wages in the U.S.S.R. as a whole.
 The average workweek is 40 hours for most white-collar workers
 and 48 hours for most blue-collar workers. Soviet law
 establishes minimum conditions of health and safety. Press
 reports suggest, however, that the laws on maximum hours of
 work and health and safety standards are widely ignored.
