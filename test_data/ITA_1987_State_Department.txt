 ITALY
 Italy is a democratic, multiparty republic with a parliamentary
 system of government. Legislative power is invested in the
 Parliament, which is directly and freely elected on the basis
 of universal adult suffrage. Executive authority is
 concentrated in the Council of Ministers. Italy has an
 independent judiciary. The Chief of State, the President, is
 elected by Parliament and representatives of Italy's
 20 regions.
 Terrorist violence of both the left and right has remained at
 low levels in recent years, due to the effective work of police
 and magistrates and its overwhelming rejection by the people
 as a whole. Although terrorism has yet to be completely
 overcome, its considerable reduction has freed increased law
 enforcement resources for the struggle against organized
 crime, which remains a serious problem.
 Italy has an industrialized market economy ranking among the
 top 10 in the world in gross national product. It is
 characterized by sizable government ownership in the primary
 industrial sectors and by a dynamic private sector, comprising
 especially small and medium-sized companies.
 The drafters of Italy's post-World War II Constitution were
 strongly influenced by Roman Catholic and social democratic
 traditions. The Constitution contains provisions for
 political and civil rights that are generally observed in
 practice.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Neither government forces nor legal opposition organizations
 engage in politically motivated killings.
 Levels of terrorism have dropped in recent years. Italian
 terrorists of the far left now generally concentrate on
 sporadic attacks on persons associated with the defense
 establishment, NATO, and government economic policy. Various
 criminal investigations have yielded evidence that Middle
 Eastern groups involved in terrorism have been active in
 Italy, some possibly supported by governments in the area.
 Italian leftist terrorists struck twice in 1987. In February
 members of a Red Brigade faction, while robbing a truck
 delivering currency to a post office, shot and killed two
 policemen. In March members of a rival Red Brigade faction
 murdered General Licio Giorgieri, Director General of the
 Defense Ministry Aeronautical and Aerospace Weapons Office.
 Italian authorities subsequently arrested several persons
 suspected of involvement in Giorgieri's murder but have not
 announced any arrests in the case of the two murdered
 policemen.
 Terrorists of Middle Eastern origin also were active. In
 January Italian officials at Milan's Linate Airport arrested a
 Lebanese citizen attempting to smuggle into Italy several
 kilograms of plastic explosive concealed in a picture. In
 June a Libyan expatriate well known for opposition to the
 Libyan Government was shot and killed in broad daylight in

 ITALY
 downtown Rome. An off-duty policeman immediately arrested the
 two attackers, both Libyan citizens.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no cases of disappearance linked to or condoned by
 the State or its agents. There were no kidnapings by political
 terrorist groups in 1987.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from torture is provided for by law and respected in
 practice. Cruel and degrading punishment is forbidden by law,
 and dases of violations have been rare. Law enforcement
 officers accused of breaking these rules have faced criminal
 charges. In its 1987 Report covering 1986, Amnesty
 International stated that for the past 2 years it had been
 looking into reports of mistreatment and torture at police
 stations and carabinieri (national police) barracks. The
 report noted that Amnesty -International wrote to the Procurator
 General of Naples in December 1986 about allegations of torture
 and ill-treatment in police stations and barracks in about 30
 cases submitted by lawyers in Naples. The Procurator General
 agreed to investigate these charges.
 Conditions of confinement vary, and some places of detention
 are outdated but not inhumane or degrading. Prisoners charged
 or convicted of terrorist acts are generally separated from
 other prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Police procedures in Italy are carefully circumscribed by law
 and judicial oversight. Arbitrary arrest is not practiced.
 Anyone detained by the authorities must be charged within 48
 hours. In normal criminal cases, the permitted duration of
 pretrial detention varies according to the gravity of the
 crime. Under reforms passed in'1984, the maximum time that
 any person may be held in pretrial detention, even for the
 most serious crimes, is 5 1/2 years, and no more than 2 years
 at each step of the trial and during the long appeals process.
 Amnesty International again commented in its 1987 Report on
 the excessive length of pretrial detention. As a safeguard
 against abuse, "liberty tribunals" are empowered to review
 evidence in cases of persons awaiting trial and to decide
 whether continued detention is warranted.
 Exile as a form of punishment is unknown. There is no forced
 or compulsory labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair trial is assured by law and observed in practice in
 almost all cases. Counsel is provided for the accused, free
 of charge if necessary. Some trials last an inordinately long
 time. For instance, a recent trial in a court of first
 instance lasted 17 months instead of the maximum 60 days
 provided for in the Civil Code. The judiciary is independent
 of the executive, and there are no political or security
 courts. All cases may be appealed to the highest appellate
 court, the Court of Cassation. There are no political
 prisoners.

 ITALY
 Debate continued in 1987 over procedures which allow reduced
 sentences for confessed offenders willing to testify against
 associates and accomplices. The system has been used
 effectively to combat terrorism and is now being employed
 against organized crime. Although there is no evidence of a
 systematic abuse of the procedure by authorities, critics
 maintain that such plea bargaining allows too much latitude to
 individual magistrates, who may be tempted to make an arrest
 before obtaining evidence to corroborate testimony by plea
 bargainers (which may not always be reliable, particularly in
 organized crime investigations). It is also claimed that the
 procedures violate the principle of equal penalties for equal
 crimes.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The concept of the privacy of the home is legally safeguarded
 and respected by the authorities. Searches and electronic
 monitoring may be carried out only under judicial warrant and
 in carefully defined circumstances.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Free speech and a free press are assured under Italy's
 democratic political system, which allows full expression of a
 wide spectrum of political views. Academic freedom is also
 respected. Although there is no censorship, publications may
 be seized for violation of obscenity laws or for defamation of
 state institutions. These powers are seldom invoked.
 Government-run radio and television are politicized at the
 administrative level but are open to widely differing views.
 A large number of private broadcasters air vigorous debate on
 political and social issues.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Italian citizens freely exercise their rights of free
 assembly, which is limited only in cases where national
 security or public safety is endangered. Professional and
 employer associations also organize and represent their
 constituencies freely.
 Trade unions are not government controlled, and their right to
 organize, engage in collective bargaining, and strike are
 fully protected by the Constitution. They associate with
 international labor bodies freely and without interference.
 According to government figures, about 40 percent of the work
 force is organized.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Italy's relations with the Roman Catholic Church are governed
 by a 1984 agreement (Concordat) between the Italian Government
 and the Holy See, ratified in 1985. The new agreement,
 replacing the Concordat of 1929, recognizes the rights and
 place of the Church but no longer accords it the status of a
 state religion. The Roman Catholic Church continues informally
 to enjoy special standing in Italy because of the presence of
 the Vatican and because the overwhelming majority of Italians
 are, at least nominally, Roman Catholic. Nevertheless, persons
 are free to profess and practice.any religious faith. All
 religions are free to organize and proselytize within the
 
 
 956
 ITALY
 limits imposed by the laws governing public order. The
 Government has reached agreements with some other religious
 groups to define their rights and standing. Roman Catholic
 religious instruction is offered in public schools as an
 optional subject.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Italian citizens may travel freely both within the country and
 abroad. Emigration is unrestricted. Citizens who leave are
 guaranteed the right to return, and the Constitution forbids
 deprivation of citizenship for political reasons. Italy has
 been.a haven for many persons fleeing persecution in other
 countries. There were no cases of forced repatriation of
 political refugees in 1987.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Italy has a democratic, free parliamentary system. Although
 the Constitution outlaws the Fascist party, a wide range of
 organized and active political parties exists from the far
 left to the far right of the political spectrum. Election
 campaigns are free and open, and voting is by secret ballot.
 The two chambers of Parliament and regional, provincial, and
 municipal councils are elected at regular intervals.
 Opposition groups are active and are frequently able to alter
 or reject government policies. The regions of Trentino-Alto
 Adigq and Val d'Aosta are organized under special statutes
 aimed at dafeguarding the rights of their respective German-
 and French-speaking minorities.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Nongovernmental organizations are free to investigate
 conditions in Italy, attend trials, and publish their findings.
 The Italian Government and nongoyernmental human rights
 organizations support human rights around the world. Italy
 participates fully in various international human rights
 organizations. Political parties and religious groups
 participate in activities related to human rights.
 Organizations active in human rights affairs include Amnesty
 International, the Official Interministerial Committee for the
 Rights of Man, the Institute of Humanitarian Law, and Caritas
 International. The Government is reportedly planning in the
 near future to establish a committee to monitor the status of
 human rights in Italy. The already existing Interministerial
 Committee is/re)ponsible only for human rights abroad.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Sodial Status
 There is no legal discrimination on the basis of race,
 religion, sex, ethnic background, or political opinion. Some
 informal social'and economic discrimination exists in the
 provision of shelter and employnient. Women generally have
 equal status under the law and participate freely in social
 and political life, though they are underrepresented in the
 professions and executive positions.

 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Minimum work and safety standards are established by law and
 buttressed and extended in collective labor contracts. The
 basic law of 1923 provides for a maximum workweek of 48 hours--
 no more than 6 days per week and 8 hours per day. The 8-hour
 day may be exceeded for some special categories. Most
 collective labor agreements provide for a 36- to 38-hour
 week. Overtime may not exceed 2 hours per day or an average
 of 12 hours per week.
 There is no minimum wage set under Italian law; basic wages
 and salaries are set forth in collective labor agreements.
 National collective labor agreements contain minimum standards
 to which individual employment agreements must conform. In
 the absence of agreement between the parties, the courts may
 step in to determine fair'wages on the basis of practice in
 related activities or related collective agreements.
 Basic health and safety standards and guidelines for
 compensation for on-the-job injury are set forth in an
 extensive body of law and regulations. In most cases, these
 standards are exceeded in collective bargaining agreements.
 Under current legislation, no child under 15 years of age may
 be employed (with some specified exceptions). The Ministry of
 Labor, having consulted with the labor organizations, may
 exceptionally authorize the employment on specific jobs of
 children over 12 years of age. The minimum age is 15 for men
 employed in dangerous, fatiguing, and unsanitary work, and 16
 for men employed underground; in quarries, mines, and tunnels
 without mechanical vehicles; in weight lifting and carrying;
 in loading and unloading sulphur ovens in Sicily; and in
 occupations harmful to the workers' morale. No worker under
 18 years maybe employed in driving and pulling trucks and
 carriages, or in jobs for the manufacture, handling, and
 salvaging of explosives. No women, regardless of age, are
 permitted to be employed underground, in quarries, mines, or
 tunnels. Only women over 21 are allowed to work on dangerous,
 fatiguing, and unsanitary jobs, on the cleaning and servicing
 of engines, or on moving machinery.
