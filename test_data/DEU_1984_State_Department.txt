 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 The Federal Republic of Germany is a modern and stable
 parliamentary democracy. The population is highly educated
 and enjoys one of the highest standards of living in the
 world. The economy of the country is highly industrialized.
 The Government of the Federal Republic scrupulously protects
 human rights. It does not subordinate women or any other
 social group.
 On the national level, there is separation of power between
 executive, legislative, and judicial branches. There is also
 division of governmental authority between national and state
 governments. The latter retain significant autonomy,
 especially in matters relating to police and judiciary,
 culture and education, the environment, and social
 assistance. The head of government, the Chancellor, is
 elected by the Bundestag, the lower house of Parliament. The
 powers of the Chancellor and of the Parliament, which are
 substantial, are set down in the Basic Law, the Constitution
 adopted in 1949. The Bundestag is elected through a mixture
 of direct constituency candidates and party lists. Members of
 the second house of Parliament, or Bundesrat, are appointed by
 the state governments.
 The Federal Republic has been ruled since its creation by a
 number of coalition governments headed by one of the two major
 parties, the Christian Democratic Union or the Social
 Democratic Party. The current Government is led by the
 Christian Democratic Union, joined by its Bavarian sister
 party, the Christian Social Union, and the small Free
 Democratic Party. The Greens, a party present in the
 Bundestag only since the elections of March 1983, believe that
 the current political system is insufficiently democratic and
 claim to practice a more participatory style of politics. The
 Greens campaign in opposition to nuclear power plants and
 nuclear weapons and for protection of the environment. They
 attracted 5.6 percent of the electorate in the 1983
 parliamentary elections and have exceeded that in subsequent
 local tests. Around 90 percent of voters normally participate
 in national elections, but local contests attract
 significantly lower participation.
 Organized essentially at the state (Land) level and operating
 under the direction of state governments, the police are
 highly disciplined and scrupulously respect human rights. In
 dealing with hostile elements, including terrorists, special
 care is taken to respect the rights of the accused.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Politically motivated killing by the Government or by
 constitutional political organizations is unknown. Terrorist
 groups on the far left (Baader-Meinhof and its successor
 groups) and the far right (neo-Nazi groups) have in the past
 engaged in political violence, but there were no cases of
 assassination or attempted assassination in 1984. No
 significant incidents of violence have occurred among groups
 of resident foreigners in 1984.

 b. Disappearance
 Governmental or police authorities do not abduct, secretly
 arrest, or otherwise clandestinely detain persons. There have
 been no kidnapings by political terrorist groups for several
 years.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Police authorities do not physically or mentally torture
 prisoners, nor do they engage in cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment short of torture. Prison conditions are adequate.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 No person may be arrested in the Federal Republic except on
 the basis of an arrest warrant issued by a competent judicial
 authority. Any person arrested by the police must be brought
 before a judge and charged no later than the end of the day
 following the day of apprehension. There is no preventive
 detention, except that a prisoner may be detained no longer
 than 24 hours while awaiting a formal charge if there is
 evidence that he might seek to flee the country to avoid
 prosecution. The right of free access to legal counsel has
 been restricted only in the cases of some terrorists who have
 used contacts with lawyers to promote and continue terrorist
 activity even while in prison. Only judges may decide on the
 admissibility or continuation of any deprivation of liberty.
 Bail bond exists in the Federal Republic but is seldom
 employed. There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are public. The Basic Law assures due process and
 prohibits double jeopardy. The judiciary is free of both
 government interference and intimidation by terrorists. There
 are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home is guaranteed by the Basic Law and
 fully respected in practice. Prior to forcible entry by
 police into a home, a warrant must be issued by a judge or, in
 an emergency, by a public prosecutor.  Electronic
 surveillance may be undertaken only after authorization by a
 court order. Mail is not monitored. The private use of
 languages other than German is completely free.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The provisions of the Basic Law, an independent press, an
 effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political
 system combine to ensure freedom of speech and press.
 Criticism of the Government is unrestricted. The media and
 artistic works are not censored. Academic freedom is
 complete. There is no censorship of foreign or domestic books.
 Newspapers and magazines are privately owned. Radio and
 television networks and stations exist, for the most part, as
 corporations under special public laws. They are governed by
 
 
 991
 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 independent boards made up of representatives of churches,
 political parties, and other organizations. A few
 experimental private television cable stations and local
 television cable networks have been set up. Legislation is
 under consideration in some German states to facilitate and
 encourage private television stations using cable, satellites,
 and other "new" media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The rights of assembly and association are fully respected, as
 is the right to demonstrate. Organizers of street
 demonstrations are required to obtain police permits
 beforehand and may be asked to pay a deposit to cover the
 repair of any damage to public facilities. When demonstrators
 have not obtained the required permits, police have exercised
 considerable restraint, showing concern ultimately only for
 the continued functioning of public facilities and for the
 safety of the general public.
 Membership in nongovernmental organizations of all types,
 including political parties, is completely free. Parties
 found to be *fundamentally antidemocratic" can be outlawed.
 Under this constitutionally based provision, the
 Constitutional Court, in the 1950's, declared both a neo-Nazi
 and a Communist party to be illegal.
 Activities of the 'peace movement' in the Federal Republic
 peaked during 1983 and continued with reduced participation in
 1984. While demonstrations were usually peaceful in nature,
 extremist elements have sometimes attempted to disrupt
 military exercises and have caused damage to property. The
 police have generally avoided confrontations while maintaining
 law and order. Perpetrators of violence have been prosecuted
 and punished. No party in the Parliament advocates the resort
 to violence in demonstrations. Members of the Greens have
 called for passive disruption of military activities.
 The right to organize, strike, and bargain collectively is
 recognized and exercised freely in the Federal Republic. The
 country has a long-established and highly organized labor
 movement, with about 40 percent of the eligible work force
 unionized. The German Trade Union Federation represents over
 80 percent of organized workers. Reborn in the wake of World
 War II, the unions are particularly conscious of their
 historic role as the protector of workers' rights and a
 bulwark of the democratic system. They actively participate
 in the International Labor Organization and in international
 and European trade union organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The practice of religion is completely free. Major religious
 groups benefit from a state-administered church tax system.
 The Government subsidizes church-affiliated schools.
 Personal religious affiliation today plays an insignificant
 role in politics and in other walks of life. Members of all
 religions can be found in all political parties.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 German citizens are free to move anywhere within the country
 and to leave and return at any time. Germans who arrive in
 the Federal Republic from the German Democratic Republic are
 treated as German citizens and therefore may take up residence
 without restrictions. The number of resettlers from the
 German Democratic Republic in 1984 represented a considerable
 increase over previous years and required considerable public
 and private efforts to help the newcomers find jobs and
 housing. The Federal Republic also regards itself as the
 homeland of all ethnic Germans and actively promotes the
 immigration of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe.
 The Federal Republic remains a favorite destination for both
 political and other refugees. Since the end of 1982, the
 Government has sought to restrict more effectively illegal
 immigration and abuse of political asylum status. The number
 of asylum seekers dropped from 107,000 in 1980 to 20,000 in
 1983 but increased to an estimated 32,000 in 1984.. Each
 request for political asylum is examined on its merits. About
 30 percent of such requests have been approved in 1984.
 In an effort to reduce the abuse of benefits available to
 displaced persons in the Federal Republic, some local and
 state governments provide assistance to displaced persons on
 an in-kind basis rather than in cash. This in effect limits
 the freedom of movement of such persons, including those who
 ultimately establish their bona fides as refugees. Those
 denied political asylum have sometimes levied complaints
 against the official handling of their cases. Denial of
 political asylum does not automatically result in
 deportation. Persons from Communist countries are normally
 allowed to remain whether or not official asylum status is
 granted.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Under the stable and liberal parliamentary democracy
 established by the Basic Law, the Federal Republic is ruled by
 a government chosen by the people through orderly elections
 based on universal suffrage. Candidates for public office are
 usually members of political parties but are not required to
 be. Because of the negative experience with splinter parties
 under the Weimar Republic, the Basic Law and the state
 constitutions contain provisions that only parties achieving
 at least 5 percent of the vote can be represented in the
 Federal and state Parliaments. New political parties are free
 to form and enter the political process. Although party
 discipline plays an important role, voting on issues in the
 Bundestag is ultimately a matter of individual decision.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The International Society for Human Rights, Amnesty
 International, and other smaller human rights organizations
 freely conduct their activities in the Federal Republic.
 Amnesty International's organization in the Federal Republic
 continues to express concern about several cases in which
 conscientious objectors were sentenced to jail and about
 
 
 993
 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 instances in which convicted terrorists have been placed under
 special restrictions in prison. Freedom House rates the
 Federal Republic *free.'
 The Government considers the international promotion of human
 rights one of its highest priorities.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Federal Republic has an advanced industrial mixed
 economy. The Government seeks to promote economic growth and
 minimize unemployment through monetary and fiscal policies
 designed to promote favorable business conditions. The social
 welfare system in the Federal Republic is of long standing and
 provides relatively generous benefits. The budgetary
 austerity of the past few years has resulted in some marginal
 reduction of basic social welfare benefits, which include old
 age and disability pensions, unemployment compensation, and
 medical care. The Government also provides extensive
 additional social benefits', including grants-in-aid to
 pregnant women. Some of these additional benefits have been
 diminished or eliminated in recent years.
 The population of the Federal Republic, now 61.4 million,
 decreased marginally in 1984. Per capita gross national
 product in 1982 was $12,461. Life expectancy at birth is 73.7
 years, and the infant mortality rate is 9.4 per 1,000 live
 births (1984). There is no discrimination in the extent to
 which shelter, health care, and education are available to all
 inhabitants, regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background, political opinion, or citizenship.
 In sharp contrast to Hitler's Germany, which glorified racism
 and demonstrated contempt for human rights on an unprecedented
 scale, the Federal Republic has enshrined the scrupulous
 protection of human rights in both law and practice, and it
 has paid out about $23 billion in compensation to survivors of
 the Nazi regime. The Government's regard for human rights
 extends to the large foreign population (around 4.5 million)
 in the Federal Republic.
 Since the passage of an equal employment rights law in 1982,
 women are guaranteed equal treatment at the workplace. They
 play significant roles in all political parties and are
 increasingly rising to management and leadership positions in
 the private and public sectors. In organized labor, about 20
 percent of union members are women, and a woman has served as
 president of the second largest trade union since 1982.
 Most women do not work outside the home. The rate of
 participation of women in the labor force, about 33 percent,
 is below the average in the European.Economic Community, and
 most working women are employed in traditional fields.
 Moreover, protective legislation bars women from working in
 certain heavy industry occupations and also generally bans
 night work. Young women experience difficulties in gaining
 access to training in some traditionally male fields. Recent
 court rulings and government pilot programs, however, have
 helped oreak down some of these attitudinal and institutional
 barriers.
 
 
 994
 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 The Government has pursued a three-pronged policy with regard
 to foreign workers: integration of longtime residents,
 limitation of further entries, and repatriation aid for those
 willing to return to their home countries. A 9-month special
 program of repatriation aid to unemployed foreign workers, in
 the form of repatriation bonuses and reimbursement of social
 security contributions, stimulated the departure of about
 300,000 persons, both workers and family members. The foreign
 population, which peaked at 4.7 million people in 1982, stood
 at 4.5 million in 1984. Foreign workers in 1983 totalled 1.7
 million, or 8.5 percent of the work force, and 36 percent were
 organized in trade unions. A national debate has been under
 way over whether the rights of guest workers should be
 broadened to permit unlimited residence and the right to vote
 or reduced by limiting the right of entry for dependent
 children.
