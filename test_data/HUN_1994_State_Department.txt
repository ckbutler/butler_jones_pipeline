 HUNGARY
 Hungary is a parliamentary democracy with a freely elected legislative assembly.
 Prime Minister Gyula Horn, the leader of the Hungarian Socialist (formerly Com-
 munist) Party, heads a coalition Government which was formed after the 1994 na-
 tional elections.
 The state internal and external security services report to a minister without
 portfoio, and the police report to the Intenior Minister. There continued to be credi-
 bl reports of police abuse.
 The new Socialist-led Government remains committed to the transition to a mar-
 ket economy. About three-quarters of Hungarys trade is with advanced industrial
 countries, and the private sector provides over half of the gross domestic product.
 However, the privatization process moved more slowly than anticipated, and living
 standards continued to fall for most of the population. Unemployment is approxi-
 mately 11 percent for the economy as a whole and about 70 percent in the Roma
 community. Services, trade, and government employ about 45 percent of the labor
 force, and industry nearly 30 percent. Major exports include raw materials, semi-
 
 
 840
 finished goods, and chemicals (40 percent); consumer goods (22 percent); and food
 and agriculture (20 percent).
 Although the Government generally respects constitutionally provided human
 rights and civil liberties, the law does not ensure due process in all cases. Prosecu-
 tors may request what amounts to unlimited pretrial detention. Police may enter
 private residences to check foreigners' identification without warrants. Police
 searching for illegal aliens resorted to widespread raids, detaining those who did not
 show appropriate documents and harassing others.
 Despite the print media's relativel high degree of independence, the Government
 influences state-owned television and radi, which dominate the airwaves. Although
 the Government does not systematically repress the Roma population, police contin-
 ued to harass and abuse Rome. Societal discrimination against Roma continued to
 be widespread. However, there were fewer anti-Semitic and racist incidents and
 sinhead attacks, largely due to the decrease in the number of foreign students in
 the country. A new law designed to strengthen the rights of ethnic minorities went
 into effect during 1994.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of such
 killings. The 1992 case of the park ranger accused of killing two Roma was appealed
 to the Supreme Court. In 1994 the Court found the ranger guilty and sentenced him
 to 10 years in prison.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 No known instances of torture occurred. Police, however, continued to harass and
 hsically abuse Roma. In one case of particularly degrading treatment, a dozen Bu-
 apest police without a warrant entered an apartment where Roma families were
 celebrating a child's birthday and began beating the women and yelling racist ob-
 scenities.
 Police also harassed and mistreated foreigners. After being given three
 breathalyzer tests at a police checkpoint in Budapest, an American citizen was
 taken to a police station. When the police produced a needle, the American citizen
 objected and requested a translator. Accori  to the citizen, the police refused to
 provide a translator and forced his compliance with the taking of blood samples by
 choking and beating him into unconsciousness. A medical report confirmed that the
 citizenhad been beaten.
 In a Budapest restaurant frequented by foreigners, more than a dozen armed po-
 lice rounded up guests and demanded identity papers. When the Chinese owner of
 the restaurant protested, the police threatened to beat him.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Police must inform suspects upon arrest
 of the charges against them and may hold them for a maximum of 72 hours before
 filing charges. The law requires that all suspects be allowed access to counsel prior
 to questioning and throughout all subsequent proceedings. The authorities must
 provide counsel for juveniles, the indigent and the mentally handicapped. The au-
 thorities respect these rights to counsel. There is no bail system; however, depend-
 ing upon the nature of the crime, the court may release the accused upon his or
 her own recognizance.
 Pretrial detention, based on a warrant issued by a judge, is initially limited to
 I year while criminal investigations are in progress; it may be extended indefinitely
 on the prosecutor's motion. In 1993, 49 people had been held for more than 1 year.
 No figures are yet available for 1994.
 In the eastern town of Debrecen, several policemen without a warrant entered the
 apartment of foreign medical students and took 10 who had only their student iden-
 tity cards to the police station. The police did not allow the students to make tele-
 phone calls and did not release them until their friends were able to produce their
 passports several hours later.
 The Penal Code does not provide for exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Under the Constitution, the courts are responsible
 for the administration of justice, with the Supreme Court exercising policy control
 over the operations and judicature of all courts. There are three levels of courts in
 the current system. Original *urisdiction in most matters rests with the local courts.
 Appeals of their rulings maybe made to county courts or to the Budapest municipal
 court, all of which also have original jurisdiction in some matters. The highest level
 of appeal is the Supreme Court, whose determinations in nonconstitutional issues
 are binding. There is no jury system; hence, judges are the final arbiters. In the
 case of military trials, appeals also may be addressed to the Supreme Court.
 
 
 841
 The Constitutional Court is charged with reviewing the constitutionality of laws
 and statutes brought before it. Parliament elects the Court's members to 9-year
 terms which may be renewed. No judge or member of the Supreme Court or the
 Constitutional Court may belong to a political party or engage in political activity.
 The law provides for the right to a fair public trial, and the authorities respect
 this right in practice. In selected cases, however, judges may agree to a closed trial
 to protect the accused or the crime victim, such as in some rape cases.
 Military trials follow civil law and may be closed if state, service, or moral
 grounds so justify. In all cases sentencing must take place publicly. Defendants are
 entitled to counsel during all phases of criminal proceedings and are presumed inno-
 cent until proven guilty. Judicial proceedings are generally investigative rather than
 adversarial  nature.
 Many human rights and Roma organizations allege that Roma receive less than
 equal treatment in court. Specifically, they argue that Roma are kept in pretrial de-
 tention more often and for longer periods of time than non-Roma. Because official
 records do not contain the ethnic identity of offenders, there is no statistical support
 for this allegation.
 In the absence of a law against hate crimes, skinhead assaults against minorities
 continue to be treated as hooliganism (a misdemeanor), and sentences are light.
 President of the Republic Arpad Goncz has proposed a law which would stiffen the
 penalties for hate crimes, but Parliament has not yet acted on this proposal.
 f, Arbitrary Interference With Privacy Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 provides that the prosecutor's office may issue search warrants independently. Po-
 lice must carry out house searches in the presence of two witnesses and mustpre-
 pare a written inventory of items removed from the premises. Wiretapping, which
 may be done for national security reasons and for legitimate criminal investigations,
 requires a court's permission. These provisions are observed in practice.
 A search warrant is not necessary, however, in cases in which the police are mak-
 ing checks on the validity of the identity papers of foreigners. In a series of raids
 in September, police conducted arbitrary identity checks in restaurants and resi-
 dences frequented by foreigners. In Budapest, a dozen policemen went to the resi-
 dence of an American business executive at 2:45 aan. to demand identification. The
 businessman was not home. The policemen left after the businessman's wife pro-
 duced the appropriate documents for herself and her small children.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 and the Government generally respects this right in practice. Some Budapest dailies
 are still partially state owned, but a broad spectrum of print media enjoy consider-
 able freedom. Newspaper and periodical subscriptions are obtained through the gov-
 ernment-controled postal system, however, which has led to charges by certain jour-
 nals that their circulation is impeded for political reasons.
 Parliament's continued failure to enact a broadcast bill meant that the Govern-
 ment retained the ability to exert political pressure on the electronic media. There
 is one private national radio station and one national radio station in which the
 Government maintains a minority share. There are no private national television
 stations. State-owned Hungarian Radio and Hungarian Television continued to
 enjoy a near monopoly of nationwide broadcasting, and the Prime Minister con-
 trolled their budgets. During the spring election campaign, the progovernment bias
 of the electronic media's news coverage was often apparent.
 Following the national elections, the outgoing Prime Minister dismissed the acting
 heads of state-run radio and television, and the incoming Prime Minister appointed
 replacements. The new management rehired and compensated many of those dis-
 missed by the former management for political reasons and then dismissed, appar-
 ently also forpolitical reasons, some 15 to 20 people. The opposition contends that
 the number of persons dismissed for political reasons is now much higher, but the
 exact number is subject to dispute.
 While some limited-range local licenses have been issued, partisan wrangling and
 pressures from television and radio unions and employee associations continued to
 block the availability of national broadcast frequencies and the privatization of ex-
 isting state channels. (However, over half of the country's households have access
 to satellite television, cable, or both.) In September the Prime Minister said his
 party was committed to continued state ownership of the two existing national tele-
 vision channels.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-There are essentially no re-
 strictions on peaceful public gatherings. In general, the Government does not re-
 quire permits for assembly except in instances when a public gathering is to take
 place near sensitive installations, such as military facilities, embassies, and key gov-
 
 
 842
 ernment buildings. Police may sometimes alter or revoke permits, but there is no
 evidence that they abuse this right.
 Any 10 or more persons may form an association, provided that it does not com-
 mit criminal offenses or disturb the rights of others. Associations with charters and
 elected officers must register with the courts.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and
 members of all faiths are allowed to practice their religion freely. There is no offi-
 cially preferred religion, but only officially approved churches receive state sub-
 sidies. The Government distributed over $28 million in state subsidies among ap-
 proximately three dozen churches. Religious orders and schools have regained some
 property confiscated by the Communist regime.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on the movement of citizens within or outside
 Hungary, including on the rights of emigration and repatriation. The Government
 may delay but not deny emigration for those who have significant court-assessed
 debts or who possess state secrets. It requires that foreign students from countries
 not having a visa waiver agreement with Hungary obtain exit visas every time they
 leave the country.
 The fighting in the former Yugoslavia resulted in a continued flow of refugees into
 Hungary. While 7,110 refugees are registered within Hungary, the Government esti-
 mates that over 30,000 more are unregistered. Most of the refugees are in private
 housing, with only around 2,000 housed in refugee camps.
 Hungary is a si  ato  to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
 and to the 1967 Potool with a caveat that it will grant refugee status only toEu-
 ropean nationals. Prospective refugees who seek only to transit to Western Europe
 are encouraged to return to their countries of departure.
 Illegal aliens, mostly non-European, are housed at the detention center at
 Kerepestarcsa pending their deportation or their qualification for resettlement in a
 third country by the local office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-
 gees (UNHCR). While police seek the timely deportation of detainees who do not
 qualify for refugee status, a shortage of funds and the detainees' lack of proper doc-
 umentation, such as passports, often result in lengthy stays. The UNHCR reports
 that conditions at the camp are acceptable. Newspapers have reported that Serbian
 refugees at the camp have threatened other residents.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens age 18 and over have the right to change their government through na-
 tional elections held at least every 4 years. The Parliament's members are elected
 through a complex voting procedure for individuals and party lists. In the 1994 na-
 tional elections, the Hungarian Socialist Party won an absolute majority and formed
 a coalition Government with the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats under Prime
 Minister Gyula Horn. Four parties, ranging from moderate to conservative, con-
 stitute an active opposition in Parliament.
 There are no leg  impediments to women's participation in government or the po-
 litical process; however, only 43 of 386 parliamentary deputies are women. There
 are few women in leadership positions in the Government or the political parties.
 Several minorities are represented in Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Numerous human rights organizations operate without government restriction or
 interference. Many nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) report that the Govern-
 ment is generally responsive to their requests for information. However, individual
 police stations are reportedly uncooperative at times, particularly in cases involving
 Roma. There is also a 25-member parliamentary Committee for Human, Minority,
 and Religious Rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Legally, women have the same rights as men, including identical inher-
 itance and property rights. While there is no overt discrimination against women,
 the number of women in middie or upper managerial positions in business and gov-
 ernment is low. Women are heavily represented in the judiciary and in the medical
 and teaching professions. The law does not prohibit sexual harassment in the work-
 place.
 While there are laws against rape, it is often unreported for cultural reasons. Po-
 lice attitudes towards victims of sexual abuse reportedly are often unsympathetic.
 According to women's organizations, the vast majority of rape and abuse cases go
 
 
 843
 unreported. Rape within marriage is illegal according to Hungarian law, but proving
 it is extremely difficult in practice. According to theNationaIAlliance of Hungarian
 Women, there were 468 reported rapes (211 by spouses) and 271 reported cases of
 assaults on women.
 Women's groups report that making women aware of their rights is a major prob-
 lem. In the fall, Hungarian television without explanation cancled "Ombudsno, the
 only television program concerned with legal and social issues affecting women.
 Chdren.-The Government is committed to children's rights. Education is man-
 datory through age 16, and employment is illegal below age 16. According to the
 National Alliance of Hungarian Women, an NGO, there were 528 reported cases of
 violence against children in 1994, 190 of which took place within the family.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The 1993 law on ethnic and minority rights
 establishes the concept of collective rights of minorities and states that minorities
 need special rights in order to preserve their ethnic identities. It explicitly permits
 organized forms of limited self-government in areas where ethnic groups constitute
 a majority, and states that the establishment of self-governing bodies must be made
 possible in localities where an ethnic group constitutes less than a majority of the
 population. Further, the new law permits associations, movements, and political
 parties based upon an ethnic or national character, and mandates unrestricted use
 of ethnic languages. Only those ethnic groups which have lived within the country's
 present borders for at least 100 years and who are citizens may obtain recognized
 status under the new law.
 On this basis, the law specifically grants minority status to 13 ethnic or national
 groups. Other groups may petition the Chairman of Parliament for inclusion if they
 comprise at least 1,000 citizens and have their own language and culture.
 In December Hungary held its first elections for minority local self-governments,
 which resulted in the formation of over 600 minority local bodies. With funding from
 the central budget and logistical support from local governments, these bodies will
 have as their primary responsibility influencing and overseeing local matters affect-
 ing the minorities. In 1995, they will also delegate electors to their own national
 assembly, forming the national minority self-government.
 In November Parliament passed a law providing for three ombudsmen, one of
 whom would be specifically charged with defending minority rights. The ombudsmen
 are expected to begin their work in the spring of 1995.
 Roma constitute about 4 percent of the population, with Germans, the second
 largest minority group, at about 2 percent. There are smaller communities of Slo-
 vaks Croats, Romanians, Poles, Greeks, Serbs, Slovenes, Armenians, Ruthenians,
 and Bulgarians, all of which are also recognized as minorities.
 Education is available to varying degrees in almost all minority languages. There
 are minority-language print media, and the state-run radio broadcasts 2-hour daily
 programs in the mother tongue of major nationalities, i.e., Slovak, Romanian, Ger-
 man, Croatian, and Serbian. State-run television carries a 30-minute program for
 the larger minority groups, complemented by 5-minute weekly news bulletins.
 Conditions of life within the Roma community are significantly poorer than among
 the general population. Roma suffer from discrimination and racist attacks and are
 considerably less educated, with lower than average incomes and life expectancy.
 The Roma unemployment rate is estimated to be 70 percent, more than six times
 the national average of 11 percent. With unemployment benefits exhausted and in-
 adequate social services, there are reports that Roma families, including young chil-
 dren, are forced to resort to stealing food to eat. Roma also constitute a majority
 of the prison population.
 The Government sponsors programs both to preserve Roma languages and cul-
 tural heritage and to assist social and economic assimilation. Nonetheless, wide-
 spread popular prejudice continues. In a November incident in the town of
 gyos, a group of skinheads threw Molotov cocktails in the windows of a Roma
 family's house and burned it down. One of the victims, who was taken into custody
 for attacking two youths whom the police said were innocent, told reporters that the
 police had forced him to change his statement. Police sometimes abuse Roma.
 Religious Minorities.-The Jewish community is generally well assimilated, and
 there were few anti-Semitic incidents. Jews are well represented in politics, the
 media, culture, and business. During the election campaign, swastikas and other
 anti-Semitic graffiti were spray-painted on posters, and in a notable incident, a bus
 which took Jewish youngsters to a Jewish summer camp at the town of Szarvas was
 spray-painted with swastikas. In a more serious incident in March, two skinheads
 stabed a Jewish passenger in the leg on a Budapest subway. The case has not yet
 come to trial. The number of assaults on Jews -by skinheads and neo-Nazi sym-
 pathizers continued to decline.
 
 
 844
 The Martin Luther King Organization (MLKO), which documents assaults on for-
 eigners of color recorded 16 such incidents in 1994, down from 20 in 1993 and 78
 in 1992. MLKO sources commented, however, that they believe many cases go unre-
 ported and that the decline in attacks is primarily due to the lower number of for-
 eign students in Hungary. There have been some reports of societal discrimination
 against persons of color.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not mandate accessibility to
 buildings or government services for people with disabilities. Services to the dis-
 abled are limited, and many buildings are not wheelchair accessible.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1992 Labor Code recognizes the right of unions
 to organize and bargain collectively and permits trade union pluralism. Workers
 have the right to associate freely, choose representatives, publish journals, and
 openly promote members' interests and views. With the exception of military per-
 sonnel and the police, they also have the right to strike. Under a separate 1992 law,
 public servants may negotiate working conditions, but the final decision on increas-
 ing salaries rests with Parliament.
 There are no restrictions on trade union contacts with international organizations,
 and unions have developed a wide range of ties with European and international
 trade union bodies.
 The largest labor union organization in Hungary is the National Confederation of
 Hungarian Trade Unions, the successor to the former monolithic Communist union,
 with over 800,000 members. The Democratic League of Independent Unions and the
 Federation of Workers' Councils, have around 250,000 and 150,000 members respec-
 tively.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code permits col-
 lective bargaining at the enterprise and industry level, although the practice is not
 widespread. There is a willingness among labor organizations to cooperate with one
 another, and it is particularly evident in their relationship in forums such as the
 National Interest Reconciliation Council (ET), which provides a forum for tripartite
 consultation among representatives from management, employees, and the Govern-
 ment. The ET discusses issues such as wage hikes and the setting of the minimum
 wage, which is centrally negotiated within the ET in order to control inflation. Indi-
 vidual trade unions and management may negotiate higher levels (but not lower
 ones) at the plant level. The Ministry of Labor is responsible for drafting labor-relat-
 ed legislation, while special labor courts enforce labor laws. The decisions of these
 courts may be appealed to the civil court system. Employers are prohibited from dis-
 criminating against unions and their organizers. The Ministry of Labor enforces this
 provision.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and the Ministry of Labor enforces this prohibition.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The National Labor Center en-
 forces the minimum age of 16 years, with exceptions for apprentice programs, which
 may begin at 15. There does not appear to be any significant abuse of this statute.
 Education is compulsory through age 16.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The ET establishes the legal minimum wage,
 which is subsequently implemented by Ministry of Labor decree. The current mini-
 mum wage, $95 a month (10,500 Forints) is insufficient to provide an adequate
 standard of living for workers and their families. Many workers, therefore, supple-
 ment their primary employment with second jobs.
 The Labor Code specifies various conditions of employment, including termination
 procedures, severance pay, maternity leave, trade union consultation rights in some
 management decisions, annual and sick leave entitlements, and labor conflict reso-
 lution procedures. Under the Code, the official workday is set at 8 hours; it may
 vary, however, depending upon the nature of the industry. A 24-hour rest period is
 required during the week.
 Labor courts and the Ministry of Labor enforce occupational safety standards set
 by the Government, but specific safety conditions are not always up to internation-
 ally accepted standards. Enforcement of occupational safety standards is not always
 effective because of the limited resources the Ministry of Labor is able to commit
 to enforcement. Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous work
 situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
