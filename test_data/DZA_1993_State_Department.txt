 ALGERIA
 Algeria's 1989 Constitution was supposed to provide for its conversion from a sin-
 gle-party Socialist state to a multiparty parliamentary system. Power, however, con-
 tinued to reside in a government composed of present and former ruling party offi-
 cials. Moreover, after an Islamist party, the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), won the
 first round in the first multiparty national legislative elections in December 1991,
 President Chadli Benjedid resigned in January 1992 under pressure from the army
 and others within the Government. The next day the regime cancelled the second
 round of elections. A five-member High State Committee (HSC) was created to act
 as Algeria's collective presidency. The HSC declared a state of emergency in Feb-
 ruary 1992 and had the FIS banned a month later. HSC president Mohamed
 Boudiaf was assassinated in June 1992; he was replaced by Ali Kafi, who remains
 in office. In August 1993, the HSC appointed Redha Malek as Prime Minister. The
 HSC has pledged to step down by January 31, 1994, to be replaced by another presi-
 dential body until the regime decides conditions merit a resumption of the political
 process.
 The police, the gendarmerie, and the army maintain internal security. In efforts
 to restore stability repress Islamic militancy, and combat terrorism, security forces
 have resorted to the use of excessive force, harsh treatment, and, in many cases,
 torture of prisoners and detainees.
 Incidents of terrorism (which began in early 1992) continued throughout 1993.
 Such incidents included daily attacks against security forces; assassinations of nu-
 merous journalists, intellectuals, and a senior political personality; and attempts
 against the lives of three government ministers.
 Algeria's industrialized hydrocarbon-based economy (agriculture accounts for less
 than 10 percent of the gross domestic product) remains largely under government
 control, with the State operating most major industries, much of the distribution
 and retail systems, and the banking and credit system. Under former Prime Min-
 ister Abdesselam, the Government pursued an economic program maintaining a pre-
 dominant state role in managing the economy. Prime Minister Redha Malek's Cabi-
 net, appointed in September, said it would pursue reforms that put more emphasis
 on the private sector. High population growth, an acute housing shortage, scarcity
 of foreign exchange, inflation and unemployment exceeding 20 percent, and the leg-
 acy of years of economic inefficiency continue to hamper government efforts to sat-
 isfy social needs.
 The human rights situation, which deteriorated severely in 1992 following the
 cancellation of elections and the declaration of a state of emergency, further deterio-
 rated in 1993. The Government extended the state of emergency and postponed new
 elections for 2 to 3 years; it continued to hold some 800 people in two administrative
 detention camps without benefit of due process, despite its pledge that it would close
 the camps; and it continued to restrict freedom of speech and press, suspending
 three new publications on security grounds while maintaining the earlier suspension
 of seven others. Within the upward spiraling cycle of violence, there were allega-
 tions that security forces engaged in extrajudicial killings, as well as credible re-
 ports of the security forces' frequent resort to torture, although the Government said
 it will not tolerate such actions. The Government claimed it investigated cases of
 security force members accused of committing such abuses but gave no details, cre-
 ating at the very least the public impression of a climate of impunity for such ac-
 tions. Other human rights problems included denial of the right to a fair trial, espe-
 cially in the antiterrorist courts, and ongoing restrictions on freedoms of assembly,
 religion, and women's rights. Extremist opposition elements also committed human
 rights abuses on a large scale, waging a campaign of terrorism and armed attacks
 which claimed the lives of some 300 members of the security forces.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killings.-Some opponents of the regime as-
 sert that the Government was responsible for politically motivated extrajudicial
 killings, arguing that at least some of the more than 500 alleged terrorists killed
 in 1993 in armed clashes with security forces were not offered the chance to surren-
 der and were thus killed extrajudicially. One credible source cited the September
 29 killing of 10 alleged terrorists in Benzerga as an example of extrajudicial killing.
 Furthermore, many Algerians believe that the Government was responsible for po-
 litical assassinations including the killing in August of senior political personality
 Kasdi Merbah; the overnment blamed Islamists (a claim denied by the FIS) for
 his death. There were also claims by Islamist opponents of the regime, and at least
 one independent human rights league, that a number of people died in official cus-
 tody as a result of harsh conditions and torture. The human rights league did not
 publicly cite any specific cases.
 Government forces were subject to armed attacks throughout the year, resulting
 in the deaths of over 300 security force members, according to official figures for
 1993. Three ministers were targets of assassination attempts: Defense Minister
 Khaled Nezzar in February, Labor Minister Tahar Hamdi in March, and Equipment
 Minister Mokdad Silt in June.
 Although armed attacks were aimed primarily against security forces and govern-
 ment officials, private citizens were also targets, including a number of civilians ac-
 cused by the opposition of collaboration with the Government, as well as foreigners
 in Algeria. InFebruary armed men attacked a schoolbus carrying gendarmes' chil-
 dren, and a bomb was placed in a universy faculty office; in   arch intellectuals
 Laadi Fici, Hafid Senhadri, and Djilali Liabes were assassinated; in April armed
 men wounded the head of the former Communist Party; in May noted writer Tahar
 Djaout was assassinated, and gunmen attacked the director of Algeria's leading
 newspaper; in June Dr. Mahfoud Boucebci and professor Mohamed Boukhobza,
 prominent professionals, were assassinated, and several ambulances carrying civil-
 ians were attacked; in July journalist Merzsk Begtache was attacked; in August
 Kasdi Merbah and journalists Rabah Zenati and Abdelhamid Benmenni were assas-
 sinated; in September writer Abderrahmane Chergou and two French citizens were
 assassinated; in October gunmen assassinated an Islamic studies professor, a former
 Marxist Party official, noted doctor and human rights advocate D*iali Belkhenchir,
 journalist Ismail Yefah, and former national television director Mustapha Abada.
 The same month, gunmen kidnaped three French consular officials (who were later
 freed), and assassinated an Islamic studies professor, an Algiers University lecturer
 and former Marxist Party official, noted doctor iad human rights activist Djilali
 Belkhenchir, journalist Ismail Yehsah, former national television director Mustapha
 Abada, two Russian military advisors, and three foreigners working for a European
 construction company. In November gunmen attacked a photographer for the news-
 paper El Watan, and kidnaped a well-known Islamic director of a national charity
 organization. In December armed elements assassinated a high-ranking Foreign
 Ministry official, a Spanish businessman, a Frenchman resident in Algeria, a Rus-
 sian woman resident in Algeria, a British computer technician working for an Amer-
 ican company, and 12 Croatian hydroelectric company employees. The Armed Is-
 lamic Group, one of the most important armed groups in Algeria, claimed respon-
 sibility for some of the actions against the foreigners.
 While difficult to confirm, there is also credible information about acts of vigilante
 vengeance against Islamists.
 b. Disappearance.-With the Government no longer engaging in a policy of large-
 scale administrative internment in southern Algeria, charges of individual dis-
 appearance were far fewer in 1993 than in 1992. Nevertheless, some regime oppo-
 nents charged that a number of people detained by security forces in 1993 were not
 heard from again. The Government denied the charge and called for the names of
 persons who allegedly had disappeared to be made public to permit an official inves-
 tigation. No such names were made public by the regime's opponents.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Knowledgeable sources, including Amnesty International (AI) and an independent
 Algerian human rights league, continued to report the frequent use of torture and
 brutal treatment of prisoners by the security forces. The National Observatory of
 Human Rights (ONDH, a government-created organization) argued that a special
 legal apparatus exists in Algeria to try those accused of torture but that many al-
 leged victims have refused to pursue their cases for fear of reprisal. Nevertheless,
 the ONDH said it had sent 10 to 12 allegations of security force mistreatment of
 detainees to the Justice Ministry for investigation. Torture techniques used by secu-
 
 
 1149
 rity forces reportedly include electric shocks, beatings, burning with cigarettes, suf-
 focating victims with cloths soaked in chemicals or filthy water, and insertion of ob-
 jects into the anus.
 The Government acknowledged that episodes of security force mistreatment of al-
 leged terrorists occurred in 1993 but rejected claims that torture by security forces
 was practiced either systematically or with official approval. Government spokes-
 men argue that some prisoners use allegations of torture for political purposes. The
 Government has pledged to investigate allegations of torture for which evidence is
 presented. According to the Government, several security force members have been
 punished for committing such abuses, but it refused to make public any information
 regarding these cases, making it impossible to confirm this claim.
 There were credible reports that extremist elements fighting the regime also com-
 mitted acts of torture, although information on such incidents is difficult to confirm.
 The bodies of two police officers kidnaped by Islamist extremists in February were
 found with signs indicating they had been tortured to death.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention and stipulates that incommunicado detention for questioning in
 criminal cases prior to arraignment may not exceed 48 hours, after which the sus-
 pect must be charged or released. Under the Penal Code, this period may be ex-
 tended to 4 days by written request of the Public Prosecutor. An antiterrorist decree
 issued in October 1992 increased the allowable length of prearraignment incommu.
 nicado detention of suspected terrorists to 12 days. However, there have been credi.
 ble charges from local human rights observers that authorities have detained people
 for more than 12 days. Critics have noted that such lengthy periods of incommuni-
 cado detention create the conditions in which torture and other abuse flourish, as
 well as making it difficult or impossible for the Government to refute allegations
 thereof. Provisional liberty may be granted if the detainee can prove that he will
 be present at all stages of the inquiry. Under law, detainees must be informed im-
 mediately of charges against them. Once charged, a person may be held in pretrial
 detention indefinitely w~hile the case is investigated.
 Provisions established in Article 5 of the State of Emergency Declaration author-
 ized the Interior Ministry to detain, in internment camps under the authority of the
 army, anyone thought to constitute a public danger. Of some 9,000 people detained
 in 8 camps in 1992, roughly 800 remained under detention in 2 camps by the end
 of 1993, despite the Government s pledges to close the camps and either release or
 try in a court of law the remaining detainees, who were detained without benefit
 of legal representation or due process. Security forces in 1993 made thousands of
 arrests for security-related incidents. (The Justice Minister told the Algerian press
 in November that 5,000 people currently in prison had been arrested on security-
 related charges.) Critics charge that many of those detained were arrested arbitrar-
 ily and without any legal basis.
 There is no bail system. Lawyers are permitted regular access to their clients (ex-
 cept for periods of prearraignment detention described above). Special antiterrorist
 courts sometimes violated this right: lawyers for defendants accused of involvement
 in the August 1992 Algiers airport bombing, for example, were denied access to cli-
 ents on several occasions before the May trial. Lawyer-client meetings are super-
 vised visually by a guard. The exact number of political detainees is not known, but
 the 800 persons remaining in detention camps who have never been charged, much
 less tried under law, would have to be include in the total.
 Exile is not a legal form of punishment in Algeria and is not known to be prac-
 ticed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial system consists of civil, military and
 special antiterrorist courts. There are no Islamic courts, although Shari'a law forms
 much of the basis for civil court rulings on social matters. All three systems are re-
 portedly seriously overloaded by an increase in the number of arrests in 1993.
 The Constitution provides for the independence of the judiciary, and it is gen-
 erally independent of the executive branch in deciding cases not involving security
 or public order. In cases involving public order, and particularly in military and
 antiterrorist courts, the Government is able to influence court decisions. Appointing
 judges is the prerogative of the executive branch; no legislative approval is nec-
 essary. Civilian judges are appointed by the President based on recommendations
 made by the Higher Magistrate's Council, composed of the President, the Minister
 of Justice, and various members of the judiciary. Because the council is led by offi-
 cials of the executive branch, its institutional independence is open to question.
 The October 1992 Antiterrorist Decree provided for three special courts, each
 made up of three civilian judges whose identities are secret to try crimes specifi-
 cally relating to terrorism. The decree defined terrorism broadly as any act commit-
 ted against individuals.., or symbols of the Republic with the aim of jeopardizing
 
 
 1150
 life, security, or property or the obstruction of public authorities or institutions. . .
 or the encouragement o? such acts, including through the reprinting or redistribu-
 tion of documents or recordings." These courts began functioning on January 3,
 1993.
 The October 1992 Antiterrorist Decree does not specifically preclude the Algerian
 public or press or foreign observers from attending special court trials, but leaves
 it to the judges' discretion whether to open or close the proceedings. Although the
 local press has attended and reported on such trials, foreign observers, including
 correspondents and human rights groups, have not been allowed to attend. Key
 cases tried by these courts in 1993 included the May trial of 54 defendants accused
 of various crimes, including the 1992 airport bombinq (the court convicted 51, hand-
 ing down 38 death sentences, including 26 in absentia), and the August trial of the
 Said Mekhloufi group (35 death sentences, including 29 in absentia). The
 antiterrorist courts handed down more than 300 death sentences during 1993, more
 than half of which were handed down in absentia. Twenty-six defendants were exe-
 cuted. AI expressed concern that many of the death sentences were imposed follow-
 ing "grossly unfair trials."
 The seial antiterrorist courts restrict certain defense rights protected by the
 regular court system. The courts have allowed the use of confessions allegedly ex-
 tracted under torture which were later repudiated by defendants in court. Under
 state of emergency provisions, the courts have restricted access to defense lawyers
 and rights of appeal. According to an April decree reinforcing the powers of these
 courts, the courts have the right to suspend lawyers from appearing before the court
 for up to 1 year for using "obstructive methods, special court prosecutors may arbi-
 trarily transfer to the special court system cases already assigned to the regular
 criminal courts, and lawyers must receive court authorization in order to represent
 clients at special court trials. Overall, these courts fail to accord the protections nec-
 essary to meet internationally accepted standards for fair trial.
 Antiterrorist courts offer the Government greater influence over the outcome of
 security-related trials, as is suggested by the high rate of convictions and death sen-
 tences. According to the Justice Minister, 85 percent of the defendants are convicted
 and 12 percent get the death penalty. The Independent Algerian League for the De-
 fense of Human Rights (LADDH) issued a statement in September calling for the
 closure of these courts, which it deemed "arbitrary and illegal." Al notes that 'exe-
 cutions after unfair trials are summary or arbitrary executions."
 In civilian courts, defendants are usually permitted unrestricted access to law-
 yers, who operate without government interference. The Algerian Bar Association
 is legally required to provide free legal services to defendants unable to afford coun-
 sel. Defendants are advised of the charges against them at the time they are bound
 over for trial. Defendants have the right to confront witnesses and present evidence.
 Trials are public, although generally not publicized, and defendants have the right
 of appeal.
 Military courts, which originally had jurisdiction only in cases involving military
 personnel, were given broad jurisdiction by Article 10 of the State of Emergency
 Declaration to try civilians for security-related crimes. Although the vast majority
 of such cases in 1993 were heard by antiterrorist courts, cases involving civilians
 heard by military courts included the trial of FIS lawyer Brahim Taouti, who was
 convicted in May of distributing a subversive document and sentenced to 3 years
 in prison. Prior to the trial, the military prosecutor had argued that a military tri-
 bunal did not have jurisdiction over this case, an argument rejected by the military
 court.
 The Government denied that there were any political prisoners in Algeria in 1993.
 Nevertheless, the State of Emergency Declaration and the Antiterrorist Decree
 allow for the sentencing of people for nonviolent expression of certain political views;
 many of the people imprisoned since February 1992 for expressing such views thus
 could be considered political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Al-
 though the Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, Article 6 of the
 State of Emergency Declaration authorizes the Interior Ministry and provincial gov-
 ernors to designate specific areas where visitors and nonresidents of particular
 areas must stay, refuse residence to anyone whose activity is perceived as threaten-
 ing to public order, and issue "exceptional search warrants" at any time of day or
 night. Security forces frequently use these special provisions to enter residences and
 question suspects. During 1993 there were increasingly frequent reports that armed
 opposition elements entered private homes, either to kidnap residents or to steal
 weapons. Many Algerians believe the security services use telephone-monitoring sys-
 tems, reportedly without the prior court authorization that is required by law.
 
 
 1151
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violation of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.--Charges of excessive force against demonstrators were far less common in
 1993 than in 1992, in part because demonstrations did not occur as frequently as
 in 1992 due to the regime's ban on demonstrations. Security forces clashed on at
 least two occasions with small gatherings of demonstrators outside mosques in Al-
 piers. Excessive force, including live fire, was reportedly used to disperse the gather-
 ings; it is not known if there were any resulting deaths or injuries. These incidents
 were not reported by the Algerian press.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Fredom of Speech and Press.-These freedoms were restricted in 1993 by the
 Government's action in suspending several publications and detaining journalists for
 reports that the Government deemed harmful to public order. They were also im-
 paired by the ongoing terrorist attacks against journalists and writers.
 The State of Emergency Declaration gives the regime broad authority to reestab-
 lish public order. This authority, bolstered by the December 1992 Antiterrorist De-
 cree forced many journals to practice self-censorship in reporting on security issues.
 It aso discouraged public expression of views supportive of the banned Islamic Sal-
 vation Front. While the Government said it did not object to criticism as long as
 such criticism did not weaken the institutions of the State or threaten security or
 public order, the Government decides what criteria to apply.
 Under authority granted to it by Article 5 of the State of Emergency Declaration
 (and Presidential Decree No. 92-320 of August 1992), the Government suspended
 three publications in 1993: El Watan, a French language independent daily, was
 suspended for 9 days in January for "prematurely printing" an account of the killing
 of several security force members; Elmassa, an Arabic-language government-owned
 daily, was suspended for 2 days in January for printing a story deemed insulting
 to the head of state of a neighboring country; and El Djazair El Youm, an Arabic-
 language independent daily, was suspended in August, and remains suspended, for
 printing an advertisement from an Islamist group challenging several death sen-
 tences handed down by an antiterrorist court. Seven journals suspended in 1992,
 including two FIS journals, also remained suspended in 1993.
 Following El Watan's suspension, a government spokesman told the press that se-
 curity-related stories would henceforth require official approval before they could be
 printed. Although no official directive was ever issued, most journals thereafter re-
 ported more cautiously on security incidents.
 Six El Watan employees, including the director, were detained by the authorities
 for 1 week in January; at the end of the year they were still considered to be on
 .provisional liberty" and could be called to trial at anytime. Three employees of El
 Djazair El Youm, including the director, were forbidden in September to leave the
 country or engage in journalistic activity and at year's end were awaiting trial by
 a special antiterrorist court. Authorities briefly detained a Reuter correspondent in
 March for erroneously reporting the assassination of a government minister. Au-
 thorities detained three employees of the independent French-language weekly
 L'Evenement, including the director, on December 15 following the publication of an
 article on Algerian Islamists that the authorities judged inflammatory. Two employ-
 ees were kept in prison; the director was granted provisional liberty for health rea-
 sons. The three face trial in a criminal court. Despite these suspensions and arrests,
 the Algerian press continues to carry expressions of opinion contrary to those of the
 Government, often including sharp criticism of the Government's political, economic,
 and social policies and often stridently criticizing the Prime Minister and President
 by name. However, the press has been careful to avoid criticism of the state of emer-
 gency or the Government's handling of the security situation.
 For fnancial reasons, most newspapers currently use state-owned companies to
 print and distribute their publications.
 The numerous terrorist attacks on the press in 1993 included, as noted in Section
 1.a., the assassinations of at least seven journalists and armed attacks against sev-
 eral others, including the director of Algeria's preeminent French-language daily.
 Radio and television remained under government control, with coverage biased in
 favor of the Government's policies. Because of the widespread accessibility of sat-
 ellite dish antennas, however, millions of Algerians have access to beth MBC (an
 Arabic-language network broadcasting from London) and European (particularly
 French) television and watch them regularly.
 Academic freedom is constrained to the extent that academicians must operate
 within similar limitations as the press with regard to criticizing the Government.
 Academic seminars and colloquia are rarely restricted, even when the topic includes
 political discussion (although, as with the press, criticism of the regime's security
 policies is discouraged). Some Algerian professors attend international conferences
 
 
 1152
 
 regularly, and many Algerian professors are active in human rights circles without
 apparent prejudice to their careers, although they too must avoid outright chal-
 lenges to the Government's security policies.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although the Constitution and
 legislation adopted in 1989 provide for the rights of assembly and association, free-
 dom of peaceful assembly is sharply curtailed under the state of emergency. Article
 7 of the State of Emergency Declaration allows the Government to close "all places
 of entertainment, halls, and assembly places, as well as ban all demonstrations like-
 ly to disturb peace a. - threaten public order."
 In 1993 the auth, .iies generally allowed meetings, assemblies, and marches to
 occur, provided they were consistent with the regime's security policies. Permits
 were granted for a national march against violence in March (in which
 antigovernment placards were carried), for public assemblies held in June by Alge-
 rian economic associations (which were critical of the Government's economic poli-
 cies), for an assembly held by the Algerian Journalists' Association (which was criti-
 cal of the Government's handling of the press), and for a gathering to mark the com-
 memoration of President Boudials 1992 assassination (at which the Government's
 handling of the investigation of the assassination was criticized). Permits were also
 granted to the Front for Socialist Forces (FFS), a political party stridently critical
 of the Government's policies, to hold public assemblies in June and October. In April
 Berber cultural groups demonstrated throughout Kabylie without having obtained
 a permit to do so; most of the demonstrations were allowed to take place, although
 at least one group of marchers was dispersed with tear gas.
 According to the July 1989 Political Associations Law, membership in political or-
 ganizations is permitted for all Algerians except judges, army and security service
 personnel, and members of the Constitutional Council. All nongovernmentalassocia-
 tions must be approved by the Interior Ministry. Most political groups operate open-
 ly, although the FIS was banned in March 1992. These range from political par-
 ties--there were over 55 parties, including some centrist Islamic parties such as
 Hamas, active in 1993-to specialized groups such as human rights and womens'
 rights groups.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Almost all Algerians are Muslim. While the Constitution
 declares Islam to be the state religion (an Algerian interpretation of the Maliki
 school of Islamic law), it prohibits discrimination based on religious belief. The Gov-
 ernment protects the rights of the small Christian and Jewish populations and often
 includes leaders of these communities at ceremonial state functions. The Jewish
 community numbers fewer than 200 and maintains a synagogue in central Algiers.
 Algerian Christians reportedly number fewer than 1,000 and often worship only in
 private. Both Roman Catholic and Protestant churches are round in Algiers, pri-
 marily serving the foreigu Christian community.
 Conversion from Islam to Christianity is extremely rare and is severely sanc-
 tioned by the community. Algerians who convert from Islam do so clandestinely. The
 Islamic clergy receives religious training administered by the Government, and the
 Ministry of Religious Affairs appoints imams to both state and privately funded
 mosques. On at least three occasions in 1993, prgoverment imams were assas-
 sinated. Also during the year, several imams were reportedly removed from their
 positions for preaching antigovernment views, and Friday sermons at larger
 mosques were reportedly monitored by security forces, lea ding regime critics to
 argue that their freedom of religion had been compromised.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Freedom to travel within Algeria and abroad and to emigrate is pro-
 vided for by law and is generally respected in practice, although minor children are
 not allowed to travel abroad without their father's permission. A curfew imposed in
 December 1992, and modified in May 1993, prohibits people from traveling within
 Algiers and surrounding provinces between 11:30 p.m. and 4 a.m. Gendarmerie
 checkpoints in the cities and countryside routinely stop vehicles to inspect identifica-
 tion papers and vehicle registrations and occasionaly search for signs of terrorist
 activity or evidence of black marketeering. There are some administrative restric-
 tions on foreign travel related to mandatory military service and the obligation to
 repay state education scholarships.
 The Constitution provides for the right of political asylum. Based on data provided
 by the Government, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHOR)
 estimates that approximately 165,000 Sahrawi refugees live in camps in southwest-
 ern Algeria. Of these, some 80,000 are considered by the UNHCR to be in vulner-
 able groups and thus in need of aid. Sahrawi refugees in southwestern Algeria are
 supported by both the Government and the UNHCR. Another estimated 50,000 dis-
 placed Tuaregs from Mali and Niger live in settlements in southern Algeria.
 
 
 1153
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The cancellation of National Assembly elections and assumption of power by the
 High State Committee (HSC) in 1992 effectively denied citizens the right to change
 their government. Constitutional provisions approved by the Nationa-Assembly in
 1989 that afford Algerians the right to change their government have been effec-
 tively suspended.
 National elections in December 1991 resulted in a decisive victory for the FIS-
 188 of the 430 assembly seats went to the FIS; 15 went to the governing National
 Liberation Front (FLN) and reflected strong popular discontent with the Govern-
 ment. In January 1992, President Bendjedid resigned under pressure from the
 army; election results were cancelled; and a 5-member presidency the HSC, was
 named to serve until December 1993 when Bendjedid's term of office was to end.
 The HC ledged to respect this mandate and said it will step down before January
 31, 1994 However, the Government has postponed resumption of the electoral proc-
 ess until it considers conditions, including the security situation, to be stable enough
 to allow a resumption. Until such time, a transition government will be responsible
 for governing the country. The Government has not offered a definitive timetable
 for new elections but has said repeatedly that 2 to 3 years would be needed before
 elections could resume.
 Two levels of local government exist: 1,541 local districts elect municipal councils
 to 4-year terms, and 48 provinces elect provincial councils to 5-year terms to work
 in consultation with provincial governors appointed by the Interior Ministry. In local
 and regional elections in June 1990, the FIS won control of 853 municipal and 32
 provincial councils. But in 1992 and 1993, under Article 8 of the State of Emergency
 Declaration, the Government replaced most elected local councils-including all 895
 FIS-controlled councils as well as some FLN, Hamas, and Rally for Culture and De-
 mocracy (RCD) councils-with government-appointed executive committees.
 Very few women are active in government; there are presently no women among
 the 26 Cabinet ministers. Fewer than than 1 percent of the candidates for assembly
 seats in the 1991 election were women, a reflection of strong social pressures
 against women's participation in politics and government.
 The Berbers, an important indigenous minority group, participate freely and ac-
 tively in the political process. Two important Kabylie-based (see Section 5) political
 parties exist, includin the FFS, which came in second to the FIS in the number
 of seats won in the December 1991 election, and the RCD. Furthermore, Berbers
 hold a number of influential positions within the Government and the army. Alge-
 rian Tuaregs (a people of Berber origin) do not play as important a role in the na-
 tional-level political process, due in large part to their small numbers (estimated in
 the tens of thousands) and their nomadic nature. Systemic or government-sanc-
 tioned barriers to political participation, however, do not exist against any minority
 groups.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights organizations are active in Algeria, including the Com-
 mittee Against Torture, the Algerian League of Human Rights (which is affiliated
 with the Maghreb Human Rights Association), the Algerian League for the Defense
 of Human Rights, and the National Observatory of Human Rights (a government-
 created organization charged with monitoring and reporting developments to the
 HSC). Human rights monitors receive wide coverage in the independent press and
 hold press conferences to express their views, including criticism of government se-
 curity policies and allegations of security force use of torture. No human rights
 cups    ave publicly aired charges of extrajudicial killings by the security forces.
 Human rights groups tend to be ignored by the government-controlled media.
 The Government permitted a visit by the secretary general of Al in April, a month
 after Al released a highly critical report on the Government's human rights record.
 He met with the then Foreign Minister Redha Malek and delivered widely reported
 public remarks critical of the Government's human rights record.
 The New York-based Middle East Watch (MEW) did not receive permission to
 visit Algeria in 1993, despite numerous requests by MEW to the Government. The
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was permitted to visit Algeria in
 April 1992, but has been denied permission to visit since then.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The 1989 Constitution specifically prohibits discrimination based on birth, race,
 sex, belief, or any other personal or social conditions or circumstance. The State of
 
 
 1154
 Emergency Declaration did not affect these prohibitions. The 1989 Constitution
 omits, however, the specific guarantees for women's political, economic, social, and
 cultural rights that had been included in the 1976 constitution.
 Women.-Women's rights are restricted by Islamic law and custom. Women's
 rights to work, live independently and generally function outside the traditional
 Muslim social norm have come under attack from Islamist leaders and conservative
 elements of society. Revisions in 1984 to Algeria's Family Code effectively restricted
 women's rights.
 Under the Family Code, much of which is based on Shari'a law, women, regard-
 less of their age, employment, or civil status, remain like minors under the legal
 guardianship of a husband or father. Although the Family Code allows husbands
 to have four wives (a rare occurrence in Algeria), it requires the husband to disclose
 his marital status and intent to both his present and future spouses. If he fails to
 tell the truth, any of his wives may file a suit in court against him for fraud or di-
 vorce. The Code awards 4 months of alimony to the woman regardless of the hus-
 band's means and the circumstances of the divorce, although under the Code the
 wife may receive a significant settlement in cash or property after divorce if so stip-
 ulated in the marriage contract. Because the Code forbids Algerian women from
 marrying non-Muslims, women engaged to non-Muslim men can be subjected to har-
 assment, reportedly including confiscation of their passports by authorities. In
 March women's rights advocates commemorated International Womens' Day by call-
 ing on the Government to protect women's rights and to change the Family Code.
 With the growing influence of highly traditional Islamist views and norms,
 secularist women regard themselves as increasingly under pressure from proponents
 of the implementation of Islamic law. Conservative societal and family pressures,
 as well as support or fear of political Islam, have compelled many Algerian women
 to wear Islamic dress, including the hijab headcovering with ankle-length overdress.
 Many other women, however, continue to wear Western dress despite what they feel
 is continuous harassment and pressure to dress more traditionally.
 Roughly 10 to 15 percent of the work force are women, most of whom work in
 urban areas. Many of these women are trained and employed in the fields of medi-
 cine, education, and the media; some women serve in the armed forces. Some ortho-
 dox Islamists have blamed high national unemployment (21 percent according to of-
 ficial figures) on female participation in the workplace and argue that women
 should not work outside the home. However, some moderate Islamist leaders have
 publicly defended the right of women to work. Girls represent just under 50 percent
 of students enrolled in primary and secondary schools and 35 percent of students
 enrolled in universities.
 The extent of violence against women is unclear. National studies on this problem
 do not exist, but the Central Hospital in Algiers alone reported more than 4,600
 cases of abuse against women requiring medical treatment in 1991 and 1992. Wom-
 en's rights advocates assert that such violence is not rare, particularly in the context
 of family conflicts (i.e., wife and sister beating) in more conservative, male-domi-
 nated families. Such abuse, however, is increasingly unacceptable to middle-class
 Algerians. Violence against women is seldom discussed publicly, although several
 independent journals published articles on the subject during 1993. Wives who are
 beaten by their husbands may file criminal charges or sue for divorce, but such legal
 actions are rare, and civil courts are far more likely to rule in favor of men, accord-
 ing to women's rights advocates. Cases of rape and incest continue to be
 underreported to police and to doctors, due to the social stigma attached in Algeria
 to victims of such crimes. The Government is committed in principle to combating
 violence against women, but, given the higher priority it places on other politica
 and security problems, it devoted few resources and little attention to this issue in
 1993.
 Children.-The Government is committed in principle to protecting children's
 human rights and welfare. Several children's advocacy groups exist, including the
 Association for Childrens' Rights and the National Association for the Defense of
 Children's Rights. Governments at the regional level offer social and sanitary serv-
 ices for children, but financial resources or such services are severely limited. Fur-
 thermore according to local observers, neither the Penal Code nor the Family Code
 offers suficient legal protection to children. Although most larger hospitals treat at
 least several dozen cases of child abuse every year, many more such cases go unre-
 orted. Some schools, according to news accounts, still use corporal punishment, and
 isciplinary beatings of children by parents are said to be common.
 National/Racial7Ethnic Minorities.-Algeria's population is ethnically mixed, and
 ethnic minorities seem to fare no better and no worse than other Algerians. Berbers
 were the original inhabitants of the region, and their ethnic consciousness, fueled
 by a desire to preserve their distinctive cultural identity and language in the face
 
 
 1155
 of the Government's emphasis on the development of an Arab identity, remains
 strong. Many Algerians are both Arab and Berber, and many Berbers hold positions
 of influence within Algerian society. Nevertheless, some Berber spokesmen assert
 that the Government implicitly seeks to repress the Berber culture, including the
 teaching and propagation of Amazight, the language of the Kabylie Berbers.
 Amazight is not taught in primary and secondary schools but is taught at Tizi
 Ouzou University. A clear expression of Berber ethnic consciousness was evident in
 April when Berber groups organized marches and demonstrations in commemora-
 tion of Berber demonstrations in 1981.
 The situation of the nomadic Tuareg of Algeria's southern desert continues to be
 of domestic and international concern. The drought in the central Sahara continues
 to disrupt traditional Tuareg patterns of life. Notwithstanding agreements nego-
 tiated between the Governments of Algeria, Mali Niger and Libya and Tuareg rep-
 resentatives, Tuareg-related grievances and conflicts otside Algeria remain unre-
 solved. As a consequence, large numbers of Tuareg refugees (from Niger and Mali)
 remain in Algeria. Government authorities encourage Algerian Tuareg to settle and
 generally treat them fairly.
 People with Dieabilities.-The Government is committed in principle to protecting
 the rights and welfare of the disabled. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs
 sponsored in January the creation of the Consultative Council for the Protection of
 Handicapped People (CNCIPH). It is charged with identifying and resolving profes-
 sional discrimination against the handicapped, organizing cultural and sporting ac-
 tivities for the handicapped, providing the handicapped with professional training
 and placement assistan    nd working to assure the accessibility of public places
 to the handicapped. Several private associations for the disabled also exist, includ-
 ing the Federation of Associations for the Physically Handicapped. The lack of avail-
 able government resources, however, greatly limits the services and assistance that
 bth the public and private associations are able to provide to the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Asciation.-Algerian workers have the right to form and be rep-
 resented by trade unions of their choice. Government approval for the creation of
 a labor union is not necessary, although considerable limits are imposed on union
 activities, and one Islamist union, SIT, has been banned. Unions are not legally al-
 lowed to be associated with political parties, although in practice some, including
 the General Union of Algerian Workers (UGTA), still are. Unions are forbidden to
 receive funds from abroad, and the Government may suspend a union's operations
 if it violates the law. Unions are also subject to dissolution by judicial means if a
 court finds the union has engaged in illegal activities.
 The State of Emergency Declaration authorized the Government to require work.
 ers to continue their usual jobs in both public and private enterprises in the event
 of an unauthorized or illegal strike. The 1990 Law on Industrial Relations permits
 strikes only after 14 days of mandatory conciliation, mediation, or arbitration ef-
 forts. This law states that arbitration decisions in worker-management disputes are
 binding on both parties. If no agreement is reached, and provided a majority of the
 workers vote by secret ballot to strike, the workers may legally strike. A minimum
 level of public services must be maintained during public service sector strikes.
 Approximately 10 major strikes and numerous minor ones were held in all sectors
 in 1993. Although many of these strikes did not satisfy the terms set by the 1990
 law (in many cases there were no attempts at arbitration or mediation), the Govern-
 ment did not prscute the striking workers. Strikes included those by dock work-
 ers, aighrt maintenance workers, and workers in the construction sector. Most of
 the strikes were resolved by wage or other concessions from management. The Gov-
 ernment did not invoke the State of Emergency provisions to force striking workers
 back to work. The 1990 law on work relations prohibits retribution against striking
 workers.
 Unions may form and join federations or confederations and affiliate with inter-
 national bodies. Several Algerian unions, including the UGTA, have sought inter-
 national contacts beyond the quasi-official Arab and African trade union organiza-
 tions in which they participate. The UGTA, for example, established direct contact
 in 1993 with the AFL-CIO.
 b. The Right to Organze and Bargain Collectively.-The 1990 law permits collec-
 tive bargain for agH unions, and this right has been freely practiced. The law also
 prohibits discrimination by employers against union members and organizers and
 provides mechanisms for resolving trade union complaints of antiunion practices by
 employers. It further permits all unions, whether Iontandin or newly created, to
 recruit members at the workplace. In the context of a new Investment Code ap-
 
 
 1156
 
 proved in September, the Government announced its intention to establish an unde-
 termined number of free trade zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is in-
 compatible with the Constitution's provisions on individual rights. The Penal Code
 was amended in 1990 to ban compulsory labor explicitly (prior to this, compulsory
 labor by convicted prisoners was allowed). This ban is effectively enforced by labor
 inspeions and penal sanctions.
 . Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum employment age is
 16years. Work inspectors, who report to the Ministry of Labor, are responsible for
 enforcing the minimum employment age by periodic or unannounced inspection vis-
 its to the workplace. The minimum age is enforced in the state sector, the country's
 largest employment sector. It is not effectively enforced in the agricultural or small
 private sectors, but violations are not widespread. However, many children under
 16 are driven by economic necessity into informal employment, such as street vend-
 ing. Legislation on acceptable working hours does not make a distinction between
 young workers and the regular work force.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The 1990 Law on Work Relations defines the
 overall framework for acceptable conditions of work but leaves specific policies with
 regard to hours, salaries, and other work conditions to the discretion of employers
 in consultation with employees. A guaranteed monthly minimum wage rate for all
 sectors is fixed by government decree. The most recent minimum wage agreement,
 reached in 1992, set the minimum monthly wage at roughly $75 (1,800 dinars) per
 month, which is not adequate to provide a worker with a family a decent standard
 of living. Ministry of Labor work inspectors are responsible for ensuring compliance
 with the minimum wage regulations, although enforcement reportedly has been in-
 consistent.
 Algeria has a 44-hour workweek with a 24-hour rest period and well developed
 occupational and health regulations codified in a January 1991 decree but enforce-
 ment by government inspectors is generally lax. Laws on working conitions do not
 specify whether workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous work
 situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
