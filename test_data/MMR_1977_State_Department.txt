 BURMA
 The Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma is governed
 under a constitution promulgated in 1974 after approval
 by national referendum. Under this basic law, President
 Ne Win presides over a one-party form of parliamentary
 government and serves as Chairman of the sole legal
 political party -- the Burma Socialist Programme Party
 (BSPP). The guiding philosophy of the BSPP is a mixture
 of socialist or Marxist-Leninist concepts and traditional
 Burmese nationalist philosophy. Thus, authoritarian
 limitations on civil and political rights are affected
 by Burma's cultural heritage.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There is no evidence that the Burmese Government uses
 or condones torture. In the past there have been
 occasional reports that suspects accused of subversion
 or other anti-governmental activities have been subjected
 to psychological intimidation (long periods of isolation,
 enforced sleeplessness, disorientation tactics) to break
 down their resistance to interrogation. We have not been
 able to confirm these reports.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punish-
 ment
 We are not aware of any intentional cruel, inhuman or
 degrading treatment or punishment employed by the
 Burmese Government. Conditions in Burmese jails are
 poor, resulting from the overall low standard of living
 in the country.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Widespread arrests on political charges occurred under
 the Revolutionary Council in 1962, 1965 and 1972. Most,
 if not all, of those arrested were subsequently released.
 In instances of widespread public disturbances, mass
 arrests have been made. There were also a large number
 of arrests in 1976 and 1977 after plots against the
 (223)
 
 
 government were uncovered, and recently in the wake of
 a Burma Socialist Programme Party internal realignment.
 The 1974 Constitution prohibits detention without charge
 beyond 24 hours, but a 1975 anti-subversion law in
 effect suspends this provision. In practice, detainees
 have been released within a short time or charged under
 criminal statutes dealing with public disorder or anti-
 government conduct. Some of those charged have been
 convicted and sentenced to long prison terms. Amnesty
 International's 1977 report states that there are "at
 least several thousand political prisoners" in Burma.
 We are unable to verify that figure, but there are
 political prisoners in Burma.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The 1974 Constitution provides Burmese citizens access
 to the courts and a public hearing for any grievances
 or charges against them. Trials since that date have
 been public. The burden of proof is upon the prosecu-
 tion and the accused has the right to an attorney. A
 system of People's Courts handles many local problems,
 including civil disputes and anti-social behavior,
 generally in accordance with traditional Burmese notions
 of community harmony and common sense fair play.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 To our knowledge the privacy of the home is generally
 respected by the Burmese Government. Exceptions occur
 during public disturbances and actual combat operations,
 particularly in insurgent areas. The 1974 Constitution
 guarantees the privacy and security of the home.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Burma's annual per capita GNP of slightly more than $100
 places it clearly among the world's least developed
 countries in economic terms. This fact accordingly
 severely restricts the government's ability to improve
 living conditions.
 
 
 Most local and foreign observers attribute the low
 growth rate of this potentially prosperous nation to
 the ineffectiveness of economic policies and the heavy
 hand of a centralized bureaucracy. In some areas, the
 standard of living has fallen below that existing when
 the current government took power in 1962. The Burmese
 Government had brought about substantial economic
 leveling, and has made real efforts, however ineffective,
 to provide for the basic needs of its citizens.
 As in many developing countries, the military and
 political elite generally enjoy a higher standard of
 living than most ordinary Burmese. Since virtually
 the whole country is involved in or tacitly supports a
 shadow black market economy (both foreign and domestic),
 the elite probably do not benefit significantly from
 corruption as much as from privileged access to housing,
 food supplies, consumer goods and health care facilities.
 However, the impact on the poor is probably not great.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Freedom of expression is limited in Burma. While private
 statements of discontent with the government are accept-
 able, public declarations in opposition to the regime
 are not tolerated. Public media are government-owned
 and controlled, and the limited foreign publications
 permitted to be imported are occasionally censored.
 Foreign radio broadcasts are widely and freely available.
 Freedom of religion is a basic tenet of the 1974 Con-
 stitution and is to our knowledge widely observed.
 Freedom of assembly, however, is restricted. Independ-
 ent, secular mass organizations (including labor unions)
 are banned. Instead a network of party-sponsored workers'
 and peasants' organizations, youth leagues, and similar
 groups have been formed. The workers' organizations,
 like the other mass organizations, provide some opportu-
 nity for expression of the views of ordinary citizens,
 but largely serve as a means of communicating national
 policies and implementing government programs.
 
 
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 The 1974 Constitution guarantees the right of citizens
 to live anywhere within Burma. Exceptions apply to
 military areas or areas of insurgent-. activity. Non-
 citizen residents of Burma (primarily Indians or Chinese,
 many of whom were born in Burma) are also subject to
 travel restrictions. They may not change their residence
 freely, and require an internal visa from the local
 people's council for any travel within Burma.
 In practice, foreign travel is denied to all but a few
 Burmese, mostly military and government officials or
 participants in ofPfially-sponsored or sanctioned
 exchange programs. Emigration is permitted, although
 bureaucratic and legal requirements make it a lengthy
 and expensive process for most Burmese. The prospective
 emigrant must resign any government job, repay the
 government for any higher education, and pay advance
 income tax on anticipated earnings abroad. Emigres who
 have adopted foreign citizenship were until recently
 not permitted to return to Burma for even a temporary
 visit. This restriction appears to have been relaxed
 somewhat in late 1976.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma is governed
 under a Constitution promulgated in 1974 after approval
 by a national referendum. Under this state socialist-
 styled basic law, President Ne Win presides over a one-
 party form of parliamentary government. The President
 is also chairman of the sole legal political party --
 the Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP). Although
 there is universal suffrage, the electorate has limited
 choice in national and local elections, since candidates
 for public office are largely pre-determined by the
 party. The election lists do include, however, non-BSPP
 candidates -- some of whom are elected to office.

 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 We are not aware of any independent, outside investiga-
 tions of human rights conducted within Burma. Nor do
 we know of any requests for such investigations by inter-
 nationally-recognized organizations. The Burmese Govern-
 ment almost certainly would not be willing to permit such
 investigations.
