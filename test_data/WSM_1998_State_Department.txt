 SAMOA
 'Samoa, a small Pacific island country with a population of approximately 162,000,
 is a parliamentary democracy with certain concessions to Samoan cultural practices.
 The Constitution provides for a Samoan head of state, a unicameral legislature com-
 posed of "matai" (family heads) elected by universal suffrage, an independent judici-
 ary, protection of Samoan land and traditional titles, and guarantees of fundamen-
 tal rights and freedoms. Executive authority is vested in the Head of State with the
 Government administered by the Cabinet, consisting of the Prime Minister and 12
 ministers chosen by him. All laws passed by the Legislative Assembly need the ap-
 proval of the Head of State, Malietoa Tanumafili II, who holds the position for life.
 The Legislative Assembly will elect his successors for 5-year terms.
 The country does not have a defense force. The small national police force is firm-
 ly under the control of the Government but has little impact beyond Apia, the cap-
 ital city. Enforcement of rules and security within individual villages is vested in
 the "fono" (Council of Matai), which settles most internal disputes. Judgments by
 the fono usually involve fines or, more rarely, banishment from the village.
 The country is poor with a market-based economy in which more than 60 percent
 of the work force is employed in the agricultural sector. Fish, kava, and coconut
 products are the principal exports. The small industrial sector is dominated by a
 Japanese factory that assembles automotive electrical parts for export. The Govern-
 ment has initiated a major push for tourism. Per capita gross domestic product is
 $1,100 per year. The country is heavily dependent on foreign aid and on remittances
 sent to family members by the more than 100,000 Samoans living overseas, mostly
 in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. Principal
 human rights abuses arise out of political discrimination against women and
 nonmatai and violence against women and children. Societal pressures and cus-
 tomary law may interfere with the ability to conduct fair trials. Those who do not
 conform to accepted societal values may face pressure, threats, and violence. There
 are some restrictions on freedoms of speech, press, and religion.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials practiced
 them. However, villages are controlled by customary law, and the fono may mete
 out banishment when deemed necessary. This is one of the harshest forms of pun-
 ishment in this collective society.
 Although jail conditions are fairly basic so far as food and sanitation are con-
 cerned, there have been no reports of abuses in prisons. While there are human
 rights groups, the question of monitoring prison conditions by them has not arisen.
 Prison visits by family members and church representatives are permitted.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 In June public allegations of arbitrary denial of bail and solitary confinement
 made by lawyers for several members of an alleged crime gang were promptly inves-
 tigated by the Attorney General's Department. The detainees were brought before
 the court and released on bail.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The law assures the right to a fair public trial,
 and this is honored by the official court system. However, many civil and criminal
 matters are not handled by courts but by village fono, which differ considerably both
 in their decisionmaking style and in the number of matai involved in the decisions.
 The Village Fono Act of 1990 gives legal recognition to the decisions of the fono and
 provides for limited recourse of appeal to the Lands and Titles. Courts and to the
 Supreme Court.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.

 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 provides for protection from invasion of the home or seizure of property without sub-
 stantive and procedural safeguards, including search warrants, which are issued by
 the judicial branch. However, there is little or no privacy in a village. While village
 officials by law must have permission to enter homes, there can be substantial social
 pressure to grant such permission.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government generally respects these rights in practice.
 However, in 1997 the then Prime Minister banned coverage of the leader of the op-
 position on state-run radio and television stations. This ban has not-been lifted, but
 remarks by the leader of the opposition received limited coverage during the year.
 However, in practice the Government's ban remains largely symbolic, since opposi-
 tion statements receive prominent coverage in the private news media.
 The Newspapers and Printers Act and the Defamation Act require journalists to
 reveal their sources in the event of a defamation suit against them. There has been
 no court case requiring that-these acts be invoked.
 Prime Minister Tofilau Eti Alesana used taxpayer funds to fight personal libel
 suits against local journalists. In June the then Prime Minister won a libel suit
 against the local pro-opposition newspaper, Samoa Observer. A New Zealand visit-
 ing judge who heard the case ruled that the Prime Minister had been libeled in a
 1992 article concerning work on a hotel owned by his family, and awarded $16,000
 (WS$ 50,000) in damages (the Prime Minister had sought $128,000 (WS$ 400,000)).
 Shortly afterwards, the Prime Minister persuaded the Cabinet to authorize payment
 of nearly $269,000 (WS$ 840,625) to cover his lawyers' fees in prosecuting the case,
 on the grounds that the public payment was justified because the allegations were
 made while he was Prime Minister.
 Two English-language newspapers and a number of Samoan-language newspapers
 are printed regularly. The Government operates a radio station and the country's
 sole television station. There are two private radio stations, and a satellite-cable
 system is now available in parts of Apia. Television from American Samoa is readily
 available.
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 In late 1997 and early 1998, the opposition movement, Tamua Ma Pule Ma Aiga,
 led three marches protesting government policies and calling for the then Prime
 Minister's resignation. The first two marches proceeded peacefully, but in January
 the Government attempted to restrict the third march by denying the marchers a
 permit, preventing them from gaining access to the government building, and ar-
 resting some who crossed police lines. However, no one was charged as a result of
 the protest.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, along
 with freedom of thought and conscience. Nearly 100 percent of the population is
 Christian. While the Constitution grants each person the right to change religion
 or belief and to worship or teach religion alone or with others, in practice the matai
 often choose the religious denomination of the aiga (extended family). There is
 strong societal pressure to support church leaders and projects financially, and such
 contributions often total more than 30 percent of family income. '
 Despite the constitutional protection, village councils sometimes banish or punish
 families that do not adhere to the prevailing religious belief in the village. In Octo-
 ber the fono banished a family in Salamumu village on the island of Upolu because
 its members had rejected the established church in the village and were holding pri-
 vate prayer meetings in their home. When the family failed to leave the village in
 accordance with the banishment order, its members were tied up, taken out of the
 village, and dumped alongside a main road. The villagers, at the order of the matai,
 burned their house and possessions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of internal movement, but in
 practice some citizens have been banished either from village activities or com-
 pletely from the village. The Government actively supports emigration as a "safety
 valve" for pressures of a growing population, especially for potentially rebellious
 youths, and because it generates foreign income through remittances. The Govern-
 ment does not restrict foreign travel arbitrarily or the right of citizens to return
 from abroad.
 Samoa has not had any refugees or asylum seekers, and it is not a party to any
 international protocol on them. The Government has not formulated a policy regard-
 
 
 1050
 ing refugees, asylees, or first asylum. However, the authorities have indicated that
 they would conform to international norms if such cases should arise.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government through direct, multiparty
 elections, but women's political rights are restricted by the fact that few of them
 are matai. While all citizens above the-age of 21 may vote, the right to run for 47
 of the 49 seats in the Legislative Assembly remains the prerogative of the approxi-
 mately 25,000 matai, 95 percent of whom are men. The remaining two seats are re-
 served for citizens not of Samoan heritage. While all adult Samoans may vote for
 the Legislative Assembly, matai continue to control local government through the
 village fono, which are open to them alone.
 The political process is more a function of personal leadershii characteristics than
 of party. Former Prime Minier r Toflau Eti Alesana and the Human Rights Protec-
 tion Party (HRPP) have dominated the   olitical process, winnin five consecutive
 elections since 1982. The 1996 general elections again gave the HRPP a majority,
 but on November 23 ill health forced Tofilau to resig as prime minister. The HRPP
 caucus selected former Deputy Prime Minister Taepa Sailele Malielegaoi to suc-
 ceed him. Tofilau remains a Member of Parliament and Minister without Portfolio.
 Although candidates are free to propose themselves for electoral office, in practice
 they require the blessing of the village high chiefs. Those who ran in the 1996 elec-
 tions in spite of fono objections faced ostracism and even banishment from their vil-
 lage. Following the elections, there were multiple charges of fraud and bribery. Four
 elections were subsequently overturned by the Supreme Court, and by-elections
 were held.
 Women occasionally reach high public office. The 12-member Cabinet has 1 female
 member, and women hold 3 of the 49 seats in Parliament. The first female judge
 was named in 1994, and the first female Attorney General was appointed in 1997.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operated without government restriction. Gov-
 ernment officials are usually cooperative.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability,
 language, or social status. This is a homogeneous society with no significant ethnic
 minorities. Politics and culture are the product of a heritage of chiefly privilege and
 power, and members of certain families have some advantages. While there is dis-
 crimination against women and nonmatai, women (and particularly female matai)
 play an important role in society and occasionally may reach high office.
 Women.-While the law prohibits abuse of women, social custom tolerates their
 physical abuse within the home. The role and rights of the village fono and tradition
 prevent police from interfering in instances of domestic violence, unless there is a
 complaint from the victim-which village custom strongly discourages. While police
 receive some complaints from abused women, domestic violence offenders are typi-
 cally punished by village councils, but only if the abuse is considered extreme. ("Ex-
 treme abuse" would be visible signs of physical abuse.) The village religious leader
 may also intervene in domestic disputes..-
 The State punishes persons responsible for extreme assault cases, which can re-
 sult in imprisonment. In August a man was sentenced to jail for 7 years for a fatal
 assault in which he poured gasoline on his former wife and set her afire. The de-
 fendant's lawyer argued against imprisonment because the defendant and his family
 had settled the matter peacefully with the woman's family, according to Samoan
 tradition. However, the judge ruled that the case was so serious that it merited im-
 prisonment in addition to the traditional out-of-court settlement.
 Many cases of rape still may go unreported because tradition and custom discour-
 age such reporting. In spite of this, the authorities note a greater number of re-
 ported cases of rape, as women slowly are becoming more forthcoming with the po-
 lice. Rape cases that reach the courts are treated seriously. Convicted offenders
 often are given relatively stiff sentences of several years' imprisonment.
 The tditional subordinate role of women is changing, albeit slowly, especially in
 the more conservative parts of society. The Ministry of Women's Affairs oversees
 and helps ensure the rights of women.
 Children.-The Government has made a strong commitment to the welfare of chil-
 dren through the implementation of various youth programs by the Ministry of Edu-
 cation and the Ministry of Health. Law and tradition prohibit severe abuse of chil-
 
 
 1051
 dren, but tradition tolerates corporal punishment. The police noted an increase in
 reported cases of child abuse, attributed to Samoans becoming more aware of the
 need to report physical, emotional, and sexual abuse of children.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government has passed no legislation pertaining to
 the status of disabled persons or regarding accessibility for the disabled. Samoan
 tradition dictates that disabled persons are cared for by their family, and this cus-
 tom is observed widely in practice.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers legally have unrestricted rights to establish
 and join organizations of their own choosing. To date two trade unions have been
 organized. The Samoa National Union, organized in 1994, is a six-member associa-
 tion, which includes workers from the three major banks. A second union represents
 members at the sole factory in the country. Both unions are independent of the Gov-
 ernment and political parties. There are no laws specific to union activity. The Com-
 missioner of Labor would adjudicate any cases of retribution against strikers or
 union leaders on a case-by-case basis.
 The Public Service Association, representing government workers, an increasingly
 important sector of the work force, also functions as a union. The Supreme Court
 has upheld the right of government workers to strike, subject to certain restrictions
 imposed principally for reasons of public safety. Workers in the private sector have
 the right to strike, but there were no strikes during the year. The Public Service
 Association freely maintains relations with international bodies and participates in
 bilateral exchanges.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.--While workers have the legal
 right to engage in collective bargaining, they have seldom practiced it, due to the
 newness of union activity and the inexperience of union leaders. However, the Pub-
 lic Service Association engages in collective bargaining on behalf of government
 workers, including bargaining on wages. Minimum wages are set by an advisory
 commission to the Minister of Labor. Wages in the private sector are determined
 by competitive demand for the required skills. Any antiunion discrimination case
 would be reported to and adjudicated by the Commissioner of Labor. Arbitration and
 mediation procedures are in place to resolve labor disputes, although these rarely
 arise.
 Labor law and practice in the one export processing zone are the same as in the
 rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-While, the Government does not
 demand compulsory labor and it is prohibited by law, in this collective society per-
 sons, including minors, frequently are called upon to work for their villages. Most
 people do so willingly, but if not, the matai can compel them to do so.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Under the
 Labor and Employment Act (LEA) of 1972 as amended, it is illegal to employ chil-
 dren under 15 years of age except in "safe and light work." The Commissioner of
 Labor refers complaints about illegal child labor to the Attorney General for enforce-
 ment. Children are frequently seen hawking goods and foodstuffs on Apia street cor-
 ners. Although a violation of the LEA, local officials mostly tolerate and overlook
 the child vendors. There are no reports of bonded labor by children, but the LEA
 does not apply to service rendered to the matai, some of whom require children to
 work for the village, primarily on village farms (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The LEA established for the private sector a
 40-hour workweek and an hourly minimum wage of $0.47 (WS$ 1.40). This mini-
 mum wage suffices for a basic standard of living when supplemented by the subsist-
 ence farming and fishing in which most families engage. The act provides that no
 worker should be required to work for more than 40 hours in any week.
 The act also establishes certain rudimentary safety and health standards, which
 the Attorney General is responsible for enforcing. However, independent observers
 report that the safety laws are not enforced strictly except when accidents highlight
 noncompliance. Many agricultural workers, among others, are inadequately pro-
 tected from pesticides and other dangers to health. Government education programs
 are addressing these concerns. The act does not apply to service rendered to the
 matai. While the act does not specifically address the right of workers to remove
 themselves from a dangerous work situation, a report of such a case to the Commis-
 sioner of Labor would prompt an investigation, without jeopardy to continued em-
 ployment. Government employees are covered under different and more stringent
 regulations, which are enforced adequately by the Public Service Commission.
