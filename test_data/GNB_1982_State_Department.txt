 GUINEA-BISSAU
 Guinea-Bissau is ruled by a small committee of party
 members using the instrumentalities of the state and party.
 The Government is headed by a prime minister subject to the
 supervision of a national revolutionary council composed
 mainly of military officers. Brigadier Joao Bernardo
 Vieira, who gained power in a coup in November 1980, remains
 President of this council and Head of State. The electoral
 and constitutional commissions and party committees established
 following the November 1981 national congress of the single
 political party, the African Party for the Independence
 of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde, continued their work
 throughout 1982. It has been stated that these commissions
 are preparing the way for national elections, a new constitu-
 tion, and the formation of a permanent governmental structure.
 The earlier political institutions including the legislature
 were dissolved following the 1980 coup.
 The fundamental orientation of state policy is towards
 government direction of the economy and society. Most of
 the enterprises in the industrial sector are state owned.
 There is a small private commercial retail sector. Steadily
 worsening economic conditions and the lack of success in
 dealing with them through a government directed economy have
 caused the Government to rethink its economic policy. The
 party platform adopted at the last party congress for the
 first time acknowledges the need for a viable private sector
 to bolster economic growth, and a newly created economic
 council has endorsed a series of reform measures including
 steps to stimulate private activity.
 In 1982 additional members of the Luis Cabral Government --
 imprisoned without trial following the November 1980 coup
 d'etat -- were freed, leaving a small group still in prison.
 New arrests and detentions in 1982 included three former
 officials of the regime (one of them a minister) accused of
 coup plotting. The Government has stated the former minister
 will be brought to trial in the near future.
 Observers generally hold that the human rights performance
 of the present Government represents some improvement over
 the record of the government it replaced. Some of the
 arbitrariness within the security system has been eased,
 although it has not been entirely eliminated, and in times
 of political tension (such as during the coup attempt in
 neighboring Gambia) government control is tightened.
 However, people are freer to travel now within the country,
 and do not need special permits which-were required under
 the Cabral regime. There have been no reports of assassina-
 tions by security forces, and instances of arbitrary arrest
 are noticeably less frequent.
 Guinea-Bissau is among the least developed countries
 in the world. The GNP per capita in 1980 was estimated at
 $162.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There are no known instances of the Government being respon-
 
 
 141
 sible for killings in 1982. There have been no terrorist
 incidents in Guinea-Bissau in recent times.
 b. Disappearance
 Disappearances are not a current problem in Guinea-Bissau,
 and are not known to have occurred during 1982.
 c. Torture
 There have been no confirmed instances of torture during
 1982, although opposition groups abroad have made allegations
 to the contrary.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Interrogation methods are at times harsh. Prison conditions
 are generally poor, reflecting the poverty of the country.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 In some security cases arrests and detention take place
 without formal safeguards. The absence of printed, accessible
 civil and criminal legal codes hinders understanding of
 legal rights and duties. Habeas corpus exists but is not
 observed in rural village areas where traditional law
 prevails.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trail
 Most non-political offenders in other than the most important
 criminal and civil cases are tried in rural areas outside
 the formal courts and under traditional law. The following
 information applies to the modern legal system. There is no
 private legal profession in Guinea-Bissau. Defendants are
 assigned legal assistants from the Ministry of Justice. The
 court system operates as part of the state apparatus rather
 than as an independent branch of government. The civilian
 courts are essentially a continuation of those under Portuguese
 colonial rule. The supreme court is the highest civilian
 court of appeal. Regional military courts have jurisdiction
 over military, militia, and security personnel on military
 missions. The supreme court (also known as the war court)
 has jurisdiction over more serious crimes such as acts
 against state security, attempts against the lives of party
 members, treason, and piracy. It is also an appeals court
 for the regional military courts. 'The death penalty may be
 appealed to the council of state. The interval between
 arrest and trial may be lengthy owing to procedural and
 political delays.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Constitution guarantees the inviolability of domicile.
 This right is not respected in cases of serious crimes or
 matters involving state security, when legal protections
 such as the need for search warrants and the definition of
 who can issue and serve them are unlikely to be observed.

 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 All national information media in Guinea-Bissau are govern-
 ment owned and controlled. Direct criticism of the Government
 and official leaders is not permitted, and journalism is
 regarded as simply another sector of government and party
 activity. At the village level, discussion between citizens
 and their government is frequently frank and has occasionally
 led to the removal of government officials. On the national
 level no expression of political opposition to the party is
 tolerated.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All organizations and associations in Guinea-Bissau are
 integral parts of either the state or the party. The
 national labor union is a mass-action organ of the party.
 It claims only 20,000 members. It is forbidden to organize
 public employees - a prohibition dating from colonial days.
 Strikes, while not illegal, are unheard of.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no religious discrimination. The majority of the
 population is animist, but other religions exist. and their
 worship is unimpeded. Religious missions also operate
 secular activities throughout the country.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are few restrictions on the freedom of movement within
 the country or on travel abroad. People no longer are
 required to obtain special permits for internal travel as
 was the case under the Cabral Government. The principal
 constraints on foreign travel appear to be economic and
 administrative, and are caused primarily by the lack of
 foreign exchange. There are no known bars to emigration.
 Since the country's borders are not rigidly controlled,
 there is believed to be a degree of unrecorded cross-border
 movement. There are no significant refugee groups in
 Guinea-Bissau. The Government, sensitive to its people's
 own past history of receiving haven in neighboring countries,
 is generally sympathetic to the principle of asylum.
 There is no sexual or other discrimination with regard to
 travel.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The political process in Guinea-Bissau can best be described
 as rule by a small committee of party members utilizing the
 instrumentalities of the state and party. All participation
 in the political process in Guinea-Bissau must, legally,
 take the form of activity within the single political
 party. The highest organ of the party, its central committee
 is subject to the national revolutionary council,, composed
 mainly of military officers, but the two institutions have
 overlapping membership. Both state and party vigorously
 assert the role of women in national development and political
 
 
 143
 and revolutionary tasks. The party and local organs by
 statute must have a stated proportion of women office
 holders. In practice, women do not occupy many prominent
 positions at the national and regional level.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Guinea-Bissau has not been active in international or
 regional human rights bodies. It has no record of sustained
 involvement with outside bodies concerned with human rights.
 In 1982 Amnesty International in its report on events in
 1981 expressed concern about the detention without trials of
 officials of the former administration and of alleged
 political opponents of the Government. No response to its
 inquiries on the fate of these people was received. However,
 many of the detainees were subsequently released.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Guinea-Bissau is among the least developed countries
 in the world. It has a population approaching one million,
 growing at a rate of about 1.8 percent. The GNP per capita
 in 1980 was estimated at $162. Life expectancy at birth is
 42 years, and the infant mortality rate is 148.5 per 1,000
 live births. Probably no more than 10 percent of the
 population has access to safe water. The primary'school
 enrollment rate is said to be 96 percent and the adult
 literacy rate is seven percent. The Government since
 independence in 1974 has placed economic development among
 its highest priorities. Progress toward these objectives
 has been hindered by a deficient infrastructure, shortages
 in trained manpower, inadequacies in administration and
 development planning capabilities, and a dearth of natural
 resources beyond a general sufficiency of water and tillable
 land. An assessment of off-shore petroleum prospects is in
 a preliminary stage.
 Foreign economic assistance to Guinea-Bissau has been
 substantial since 1974, but the rate of absorption of
 international and local development investment is low.
 Acknowledging that it faces an economic crisis, the Government
 in 1982 has taken a number of steps toward reexamining the
 viability of various state enterprises and has reshuffled
 the leadership of the country's economic and financial
 entities. Previous tentative steps toward granting some
 recognition to the productive role of private initiative
 have received additional impetus.
