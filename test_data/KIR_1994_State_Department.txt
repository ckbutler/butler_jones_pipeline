 KIRIBATI
 The nation of Kiribati comprises some 76,300 people occupying 33 small islands
 widely scattered across 3.5 million square kilometers of the central Pacific. The pop-
 ulation is primarily Micronesian, with a significant component of Polynesian origin.
 Kiribati gained full independence from the United Kingdom in 1979 and became a
 republic within the Commonwealth of Nations. It has a nationally elected president
 and a legislative assembly with 39 members elected by universal suffrage and 2
 members ex officio.
 The main security apparatus is a police force of about 250 personnel, responsible
 to and effectively controled by civilian authority.
 Economic activity consists primarily of subsistence agriculture and fishing. The is-
 lands' isolation and meager resources, including poor soil and limited arable land,
 severely limit prospects for economic development.
 Kiribati society is egalitarian, democratic, and respectful of human rights. There
 were no reports of specific human rights abuses in 1994, but in the traditional cul-
 ture women have occupied a subordinate role, with limits on their job opportunities.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated or other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.

 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment are forbidden
 by the Constitution, corporal punishment is permitted under traditional mores for
 criminal acts and other transgressions. On some outer islands, the island councils
 occasionally order strokes with palm fronds to be administered for public drunken-
 ness and other minor offenses such as petty thievery.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Eiile.--Constitutional safeguards against arbi-
 trary arrest and detention are observed in practice. There is no exile, internal or
 external.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-The right to a fair public trial is assured by law
 and observedin practice. The Constitution provides that an accused person be in-
 formed of the nature of the offense for which he is charged and be provided ade-
 quate time and facilities to prepare a defense. The r t to confront witnesses,
 present evidence and appeal convictions is enshrined in law.
 Procedural safeguards are based on English common law. The judiciary is inde-
 pendent and free of governmental interference. Kiribati has no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The pri-
 vacy of the home is protected in law and respected by the Government. There is
 no arbitrary intrusion by the State or political organizations into the private life of
 the individual.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and press is provided for in
 the Constitution and observed in practice. Kiribati's radio station and only news-
 paper are government owned but offer a variety of views. Churches publish news-
 letters and other periodicals. Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, including the rioht to form or belong to asso-
 ciations for the advancement or protection of a group s interests. There are no sig-
 nificant restrictions in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion prevails. There is no state or pre-
 ferred religion. Missionaries are free to seek converts.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Citizens are free to travel within the country and abroad. There are no
 restrictions on repatriation. Kiribati has no refugees or displaced persons.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Government is chosen by the eople in periodic free and open elections. Exec-
 utive authority is exercised by the President, who is elected by the people for a 4-
 year term. No less than three and no more than four presidential candidates are
 nominated by the elected Legislative Assembly from among its members. Under the
 Constitution, the President is limited to three terms.
 Prior to a snap general election held in August, there had been no formally orga-
 nized parties, although election time did bring about coalitions of various interest
 groups. Since independence in 1979, the former ruling group called itself the Na-
 tional Progressive Party. After the Government fell in May in a no-confidence vote,
 the opposition forces which brought it down formed the Maneaban Te Mauri Party
 (MTM). In the August parliamentary election, the MTM won 19 of the 39 seats in
 the Assembly. An opposition leader, Teburoro Tito, was elected President in the Sep-
 tember balloting.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no restrictions on the formation of local nongovernmental organizations
 that concern themselves with human rights, but to date none has been formed.
 There have been no reported allegations of human rights violations by the Govern-
 ment and no known requests for investigations. Kiribati is not a member of the
 United Nations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Relgion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, creed, national ori-
 gin, or sex, and this prohibition is generally observed in practice. Kiribati society,
 fundamentally egalitarian, has no privileged chiefly class.
 Women.-The traditional culture, in which males are dominant, has been an im-
 pediment to women taking a more active role in the economy. This is slowly chang-
 ing, and more women are finding work in unskilled and semiskilled occupations.
 There are also signs of affirmative action in government hiring and promotions to
 
 
 616
 redress this culturally based inequity. Recent examples of affirmative action with
 regard to the advancement of women include the appointment of Makurita Baaro
 as the nation's first female Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Furthermore, the selection
 of recent female participants from Kiribati in overseas training programs in the
 United States, Japan, and other countries reflects a firm commitment to the ad-
 vancement of women. Women have full and equal access to education.
 Statistics on the participation of women in the work force and comparative wages
 are unavailable. Women have full rights of ownership and inheritance of property.
 Violence against women does not appear to be a major problem in this isolated,
 rural society. Rape is a crime under the law, and the law is enforced when charges
 are brought to court. To the extent that it exists, wife beating is dealt with infor-
 mally and in a traditional way, frequently, communal pressure is brought to bear.
 Children.-If child abuse exists, it is rare and has not become a source of societal
 concern. Within the limited resources of the Government, adequate expenditures are
 made for child welfare.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no evidence or complaint of discrimination in
 employment, education, or provision of other state services. Accessibility for the dis-
 abled has not been mandated.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Freedom of association is provided for in the Con-
 stitution. Workers are free to organize unions and choose their own representatives.
 The Government does not control or restrict unions. Over 90 percent of the work
 force is occupied in fishing or subsistence farming, but the small wage sector has
 a relatively strong and effective trade union movement. In 1982 the seven trade
 unions registered in Kiribati merged to form the Kiribati Trade Union Congress
 (KTUC). It has approximately 2,500 members, mostly from the public service sector.
 The KTUC is aflfliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 The right to strike is provided for by law. However, strikes are rare, the last one
 having taken place in 1980.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 vided for under the Industrial Relations Code. Government wage setting is the rule
 in the large public sector. The Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Employment
 sets wages aer consultations with the Ministry of Finance and Econonnc Plannng.
 However, in a few statutory bodies and government-owned companies, employees
 may negotiate wages and other conditions. In the private sector, employees may also
 negotiate wages with employers. Negotiations are generally nonconfrontational, in
 keeping with~iribati tradition. There have been no reports of antiunion discrimina-
 tion. However, there are mechanisms for resolving any such complaints. Kiribati has
 no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited under the Constitution and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Kiribati law prohibits the employ-
 ment of children under age 14. Children through age 15 are prohibited from indus-
 trial employment and employment aboard ships. Labor officers from the Ministry of
 Commerce, Industry, and Employment normally enforce these laws effectively, given
 the rudimentary conditions of the economy an its industrial relations system. Chil-
 dren are rarely employed outside the traditional economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government has taken no concrete action
 to implement Iongstanding legislation authorizing establishment of minimum wages.
 There is no legislatively prescribed workweek. The Government is the major em-
 player in the cash economy.
 Employment laws provide rudimentary health and safety standards for the work-
 place. Employers must, for example, provide an adeqate supply of clean water for
 workers and ensure the existence of sanitary toilet facilities. Employers are liable
 for the expenses of workers injured on the job. The Government's ability to enforce
 employment laws is hampered by a lack of qualified enforcement personnel. Women
 may not work at night except under specified circumstances (generally in service
 jobs such as hotel clerks).
