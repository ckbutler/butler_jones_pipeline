 MOLDOVA
 Moldova gained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. In 1994 it adopt-
 ed a constitution that provides for a multiparty representative government with
 power divided among a president, cabinet, parliament, and judiciary. President
 Petru Lucinschi began his 4-year term in 1997. In March parliamentary elections,
 4 center and center-right parties won 61 seats and formed a coalition government.
 Prime Minister Ion Ciubuc retained his office. The Communist Party won the re-
 maining 40 seats and is in the opposition. International observers considered the
 elections to be free and fair, but authorities in the separatist Transnistrian region
 interfered with citizens' ability to vote. Although increasing in independence, the ju-
 diciary is still subject to the influence of the prosecutor's office.

 The country remains divided, with mostly Slavic separatists controlling the
 Transnistrian region along the Ukrainian border. This separatist regime has en-
 tered into negotiations with the national Government on the possibility of a special
 status for the region. Progress in resolving the ongoing conflict has been blocked by
 the Government's preoccupation with elections, failure to produce a coherent na-
 tional policy, and the separatists' continuing demands for "statehood" and recogni-
 tion of the-country as a confederation of two equal states. The Organization for Se-
 curity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Russian Federation, -and Ukraine act
 as mediators. The two sides generally have observed, the cease-fire of 1992, which
 ended armed conflict between them, but other agreements to normalize relations
 often have not been honored. One positive step in normalizing relations occurred in
 June when -the Dubasari bridge across the Nistru River, the "border" of
 Transnistria, was reopened. In October the Government announced a unilateral re-
 duction of troops in the zone. A Christian Turkic minority, the Gagauz, enjoys local
 autonomy in the southern part of the country.
 The Ministry of Internal Affairs has responsibility for the police. The Ministry of
 National Security controls other security organs, including the border guards ((97
 text; still correct?)). The Constitution assigns to Parliament the authority to inves-
 tigate the activities of these ministries to ensure that they comply with existing leg-
 islation. Some members of the security forces committed a number of human rights
 abuses.
 The country continued to make progress in economic reform. The new Govern-
 ment includes Ministers of the Economy and Finance whom international observers
 view as reformers. The economy is largely based on agriculture. Citizens and for-
 eigners can buy and sell land at market prices. However, foreigners cannot buy agri-
 cultural land, nor can agricultural land be resold for a period of 5 years. In 1997
 the government land privatization program helped to break up more than 70 joint
 stock associations, the successors to the collective farms, and to issue land titles to
 their former members. This program has proven extremely popular, and hundreds
 of additional farms have signed up to participate in it. Only a few association man-
 agers did not support the program, particularly in Gagauzia. The leading exports
 are foodstuffs, wine, tobacco, clothing, and footwear. The gross domestic product
 (GDP) is estimated officially at about $440 per capita but may be considerably un-
 derestimated because of underreporting for tax purposes. The officially reported me-
 dian salary is $45 per month..According to government statistics about 80 percent
 of the population lives below the poverty level and 10 percent of the rural popu-
 lation has a per capita income of less than one-quarter of that level. A majority of
 citizens cannot afford to buy fish, meat, milk and other dairy products on a regular
 basis. GDP rose slightly in 1997 but projected growth for 1998 was hampered by
 the effect of the Russian economic crisis. Real growth may be masked by unreported
 production. A program privatizing state-owned enterprises and real estate based on
 vouchers issued to all citizens is complete. The exchange rate is stable and the aver-
 age monthly inflation rate was under 1 percent. The external debt totaled over $600
 million. The economic situation is worse in Transnistria.
 The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens, however,
 there were problems in some areas. The police occasionally beat detainees and pris-
 oners. Prison conditions remain harsh, with attempts to improve them hampered by
 lack of fimding. The judiciary is subject to the influence of the prosecutor's office.
 Security forces monitor political figures, use unauthorized wiretaps, and at times
 conduct illegal searches. The Constitution potentially limits the activities of the
 press, political parties, and religious groups. Journalists practice self-censorship.
 The law also imposes restrictions on some religious groups. Societal discrimination
 and violence against women persists. Trafficking in women is a problem. Addressing
 a minority concern, the Constitution allows parents the right to choose the language
 of education for their children.
 The Transnistrian authorities continue to be responsible for abuses, including
 questionable detentions, harassment of independent media, restrictions on freedom
 of religion, and discrimination against Romanian/Moldovan speakers.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings either in Moldova or its separatist region.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution forbids torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 
 
 1387
 or punishment. There were no allegations of torture by the authorities, but there
 were credible reports that police sometimes beat prisoners or suspects.
 There was an unconfirmed NGO report of two police officers beating Roma in
 Soroca in an incident in 1997.
 Conditions in most prisons remain harsh, with serious overcrowding. Cell sizes do
 not meet local legal requirements or minimum international standards. Conditions
 are especially harsh in prisons used to hold persons awaiting trial or sentencing.
 These prisons suffer from overcrowding, bad ventilation, and a lack of recreational
 and rehabilitation facilities. Conditions for those serving sentences are only margin-
 ally better. The incidence of malnutrition and disease, especially tuberculosis, is
 high in all facilities. Abuse of prisoners by other prisoners or jailers themselves, os-
 tensibly for disciplinary reasons, has been reduced by the dismissal or retirement
 of some of the worst offending guards. The Ministry of Justice administers the pris-
 on system. Attempts to improve prison conditions are frustrated by a lack of financ-
 ing.: One new prison was opened during the year, in an attempt to reduce over
 crowding and improve conditions.
 Human rights monitors are permitted to visit prisons.
 Requests by human rights monitors to inspect prisons in Transnistria have been
 refused.
 After questionable trials, four ethnic Moldovans are serving sentences in
 Transnistria for alleged terrorism-related crimes (see Section I.e.). The Helsinki
 Committee for Human Rights (HCHR) in Moldova was allowed to send medical ex-
 perts to examine one of the prisoners in March. In March Tudor Petrov-Popa, an-
 other of the "Tiraspol Six," attempted suicide by slashing his abdomen with a razor.
 Transnistrian officials claimed that Petrov-Popa received proper medical treatment
 and that his condition had stabilized. In October representatives from the OSCE fi-
 nally were permitted to visit Ilie Ilascu in his Tiraspol prison, after Transnistrian
 authorities had denied their requests for months. The International Committee of
 the Red Cross (ICRC) visited these prisoners in 1992 and 1993 in Tiraspol, but later
 was denied visitation. The ICRC did not request a visit in 1998.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The former Soviet Code on Penal Proce-
 dure remains in force with some amendments. Prosecutors issue arrest warrants.
 Under the Constitution, a suspect may be detained without charge for 24 hours. The
 suspect is normally allowed family visits during this period. The 24-hour time limit
 is not always respected, especially if a person is arrested late on a Friday or on a
 weekend. If charged, a suspect may be released pending trial. There is no system
 of bail, but in some cases, a friend or relative, in order to arrange release, may give
 a written pledge that the accused would appear for trial. Suspects accused of violent
 or serious crimes generally are not released before trial. The Constitution permits
 pretrial arrest for an initial period of 30 days, which may be extended up to 6
 months. In exceptional cases, Parliament may approve extension of pretrial deten-
 tion on an individual basis of up to 12 months. The accused has the right under
 the Constitution to a hearing before a court regarding the legality of his arrest. Ac-
 cording to figures provided by the Ministry of Justice in October, of a prison popu-
 lation of 10,521, 1,530 persons were held in confinement awaiting trial (these statis-
 tics do not include persons held in Transnistria).
 According to the Constitution, a detained person must be informed immediately
 of the reason for his arrest and must be made aware of the charges "as quickly as
 possible." The accused has the right to a defense attorney throughout the entire
 process, and the attorney must be present when the charges are brought. Many law-
 yers point out that access to a lawyer generally is granted only after a person has
 been detained for 24 hours. If the defendant cannot afford an attorney, the State
 requires the local bar association to provide one. Because the State is unable to pay
 ongoing legal fees, a lawyer who is less than competent or energetic often is chosen.
 The Transnistrian authorities have imposed a state of emergency that allows law
 enforcement officials to detain suspects for up to 30 days, reportedly without access
 to an attorney. There were no reports that Transnistrian authorities used this provi-
 sion during the year.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, however, the prosecutor's office still has undue influence. However, many ob-
 servers believe that arrears in salary payments make it difficult for judges to re-
 main independent and free from corruption. Since 1997 prosecutors have the right
 to open and close investigations without bringing the matter before a court, which
 gives them considerable influence over the judicial process. The Constitution pro-
 vides that the President, on the nomination of the Superior Court of Magistrates,
 appoints judges for an initial period of 5 years. They may be reappointed for a sub-
 
 
 1388
 sequent 10 years, after which they serve until retirement age. This provision for ju-
 dicial tenure is designed to increase judicial independence.
 The judiciary consists of lower courts of the first instance, five appellate courts
 (tribunals), a Higher Court of Appeals, a Supreme Court, and a Constitutional
 Court. The Supreme Court supervises and reviews the activities of the lower courts,
 and serves as a final court of appeal.
 By law defendants in criminal cases are presumed innocent. In practice prosecu-
 tors' recommendations still carry considerable weight and limit the defendant's ac-
 tual presumption of innocence. Trials generally are open to the public. Defendants
 have the right to attend proceedings, confront witnesses, and present evidence. De-
 fense attorneys are able to review the evidence against their clients when preparing
 cases. The accused enjoys a right to appeal to a higher court. Because of a lack of
 funding for adequate facilities and personnel, there is a large backlog of cases at
 the tribunal and Higher Appeals Court levels. Court decisions involving the restitu-
 tion of salary or a position are not always implemented.
 To date no pattern of discrimination has emerged in the judicial system. The Con-
 stitution provides for the right of the accused to have an interpreter both at the trial
 and in reviewing the documents of the case. If the majority of the participants
 agree, trials may take place in Russian or another acceptable language instead of
 Romanian/Moldovan.
 . There continue to be credible reports that local prosecutors and judges extort
 bribes for reducing charges or sentences. Such charges were brought against a pros-
 ecutor and a deputy prosecutor in Cainari in 1997; in the fall the two were convicted
 and sentenced to 10 years in prison each. Prosecutors occasionally use bureaucratic
 maneuvers to restrict lawyers' access to clients.
 There were no reports of political prisoners outside Transnistria.
 In Transnistria, four ethnic Moldovans, members of the "Ilascu Six," (one of
 whom, Ilie Ilascu, is an elected member of the Moldovan Parliament but has never
 been able to take his seat) remain in prison following their conviction in 1993 for
 allegedly killing two separatist officials. International human rights groups raised
 serious questions about the fairness of the trial; local organizations alleged that the
 Moldovans were prosecuted solely because of their membership in the Christian
 Democratic Popular Front, a Moldovan political party that favors reunification with
 Romania. Family members have been allowed access. The HCHR in Moldova was
 allowed to send medical experts to examine one of the prisoners in March, and the
 OSGE was permitted to see another prisoner in October.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Pros-
 ecutors issue search warrants. In some instances searches are conducted without
 warrants. Courts do not exclude evidence that was obtained illegally. There is no
 judicial review of search warrants. The Constitution specifies that searches must be
 carried out "in accordance with the law" but does not specify the consequences if
 the law is not respected. It also forbids searches at night, except in the case of fla-
 grant crime.
 It is widely believed that security agencies continue to use electronic monitoring
 of residences and telephones without- proper authorization. By law the prosecutor's
 office must authorize wiretaps and may do so only if a criminal investigation is
 under way. In practice, the prosecutor's office lacks the ability to control the security
 organizations and police and prevent them from using wiretaps illegally.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution and the law provide for free-
 dom of speech and of the press, although with some restrictions. The Government
 does not abridge freedom of speech, and the print media express a wide variety of
 political views and commentary. National and city governments subsidize a number
 of newspapers, but political parties and professional organizations, including trade
 unions, also publish newspapers. Most newspapers have circulations of less than
 5,000.
 Although the number of media outlets that are not owned and operated publicly
 by the State or a political party is growing, most of these "independent" media are
 still in the service of a politician or political movement, commercial interest, or for-
 eign country, and secure large subsidies from these sources. There are several inde-
 pendent radio stations, including a religious one, with some rebroadcasting from Ro-
 mania and Russia. There are two independent television stations in the Chisinau
 area and one in the city of Balti. The Government owns and operates several radio
 stations and a television channel that covers most of the country. A number of local
 governments, including Gagauzia, operate television and radio stations.
 The Constitution restricts press freedoms, forbidding "disputing or defaming. the
 state and the people" and political parties that "militate" against the country's sov-
 
 
 1389
 ereigty, independence, and territorial integrity. These restrictions lack implement-
 ing legislation and are not invoked. The press law includes an article that allows
 public figures to sue for defamation without distinguishing between their private
 and public persons. Criticism of public figures has resulted in a number of lawsuits,
 and as a consequence, journalistspractice self-censorship. In cases where suits have
 been filed against journalists an media organs, the plaintiffs usually lose. There
 is no freedom of information legislation, and journalists and ordinary citizens often
 have difficulty obtaining information from government organizations.
 The Government does not restrict foreign publications. However, foreign publica-
 tions do not circulate widely since they are very expensive by local standards. How-
 ever, Russian newspapers are available, and some publish a special Moldovan week-
 ly supplement. The country receives television and radio broadcasts from Romania
 and Russia. A very small number of cable subscribers receive a variety of foreign
 cable television programs.
 Of the two major newspapers in Transnistria, one is controlled by the regional au-
 thorities and the other by the Tiraspol city government. There are also independent
 newspapers in Tiraspol and the northern Transnistrian city of Ribnitsa. The latter
 two criticize the regime from time to time and have been harassed by the separatist
 authorities. Other print media in Transnistria do not have large circulations and ap-
 pear only on a weekly or monthly basis. Nonetheless, some of them also criticize
 local authorities. The one independent television station is trying to enlarge its
 broadcast radius, but currently is producing less than 10 hours of programming per
 week. Resistance to this move comes from the local official Transnistrian television
 station, which previously had enjoyed a virtual monopoly of advertising revenues.
 Most Moldovan newspapers do not circulate in Transnstria. Circulation of all print
 media in Transnistria is hampered by the closed nature of society, as well as by the
 local economic crisis, which is more severe than in the rest of the country.
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to peaceful assembly and authorities respect this right in practice. Mayors'
 offices issue permits for demonstrations; they may consult the national government
 if a demonstration is likely to be extremely large
 The Constitution states that citizens are free to form parties and other social and
 political organizations. Private organizations, including political parties, are re-
 quired to register, but applications are approved routinely. The Constitution forbids
 parties that "militate against the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity
 of Moldova." In October Parliament passed a law allowing only political parties of
 5,000 members or more to be registered officially.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government generally permits the free practice of
 religion. However, a 1992 law on religion that codifies religious freedoms contains
 restrictions that could inhibit the activities of some. religious groups. The law pro-
 vides for freedom of religious practice, including each person's right to profess his
 religion in any form. It also protects the confidentiality of the confessional, allows
 denominations to establish associations and foundations, and states that the Gov-
 ernment may not interfere in the religious activities of denominations. However, the
 law forbids proselytizing and requires that religious groups register with the Gov-
 ernment in order to hire noacitizens. The Salvation Army was unable to register in
 1996 as a religious denomination, because it did not meet the requirement of having
 a citizen as the organization's legal head. Similarly, on technical grounds Jehovah's
 Witnesses were unable to registerin Tiraspol in 1997.
 Although some Protestantdenominations areconcerned that the prohibition on
 proselytizing could inhibit their activities, to date, the authorities have not taken
 lgal action against individdes for proselytizinig. The Parliament amended the law
 to legalize proselytizing in November, in principle bringing Moldovan legislation in
 line with the Eurrpean Convention on Human Rights. However, the draft law would
 explicitly forbid "abusive proselytizing," and the bill defines "abusive" broadiy. For
 example, taking advantage of a person's naivete, low intellect, or lack of experience
 would fall under this definition. Many Protestant denominations are concerned
 about the possible enforcement of this broad definition of abusive proselytizing. The
 President ad notyet signed the law by year's end. 
 Although Eastern Orthodoxy is not designated in the law on religion as the offi-
 cial religion, it continued to be a strong reigious frce and exerted signcant influ-
 ence. In 1992 a number of priests broke away from the Moldovan Orthodox Church,
 which is subordinate to the Moscow Patriarchate, intorder to form the Bessarabian
 Orthodox Church. The Bessarabian Orthodox Church, which sees itself as the legal
 and canonical successor to the pre-World War II Romanian Orthodox Church in Bes-
 sarabia (the part of Moldova between the Dniester and Prut Rivers), subordinated
 itself to the Bucharest Patriarchate of the Romanian Orthodox Church. The Govern-
 
 
 1390
 
 ment consistently has refused to register the Bessarabian Church, citing unresolved
 property claims as the principal reason. The issue has political overtones as well,
 since it raises the question whether the Orthodox Church should be united and ori-
 ented toward Moscow or divided with a branch oriented toward Bucharest, although
 leaders of the Moldovan Orthodox Church appeared more interested this year in
 independence than alliance to Moscow. In 1997 the Supreme Court overturned an
 appeals court decision affirming the right of the Bessarabian Church to be reg-
 istered. However, the Supreme Court's decision was based on a procedural issue,
 rather than on the merits of the case. The Bessarabian Church appealed the case
 to the European Court.
 In January authorities in Transnistria cancelled the registration of Jehovah's Wit-
 nesses. Repeated attempts by Jehovah's Witnesses to reregister have been denied
 or delayed. Transnistrian officials confiscated a truckload of religious tracts in May
 1997 and have refused to return them until the group is registered properly. Accord-
 ing to local leaders of Jehovah's Witnesses, several members have been questioned
 by local state security officers but always have been released within 1 hour.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict travel within the country, and there
 are no closed areas. Citizens generally are able to travel freely; however, there are
 some restrictions on emigration. Close relatives with a claim to support from the
 applicant must give their concurrence. The Government also may deny permission
 to emigrate if the applicant had, access to state secrets. However, such cases are
 very rare, and none were during the year.
 Travel between Transnistria and the rest of the country is not prevented. There
 are regularly scheduled buses and trains. However, the separatist authorities often
 stop and search incoming and outgoing vehicles.
 Moldova is not a party to the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the
 Status of Refugees or its 1967 Protocol. The Government has no processing proce-
 dures for potential refugees resident in the country. The issue of providing first asy-
 lum has never arisen formally. There were no reports of the forced return of persons
 to a country where they feared prosecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens voted in the second multiparty parliamentary elections in 1998, after the
 country's second presidential election in 1996. Members of 4 center and center-right
 parties won a clear majority with 61' of 101 seats and formed a coalition govern-
 ment. International observers considered the elections to be free and fair, but
 Transnistrian authorities interfered with citizens' ability to vote by blocking busses
 carrying citizens who were heading for the west bank of the Dniester to cast their
 ballots. The establishment of a coalition government and the peaceful transition of
 presidential power in 1997 represent further progress in the transition to democ-
 racy.
 The Constitution adopted in 1994 provides for the division of power among the
 popularly elected President, the Cabinet, the Parliament, and the judiciary. The
 President, as Head of State, in consultation with the Parliament, appoints the Cabi-
 net and the Prime Minister, who functions as the head of government. However, a
 minister can only be dismissed with the assent of the Prime Minister. Some observ-
 ers believe that the Constitution does not define adequately how executive powers
 are to be shared between the President and the Prime Minister.
 The Constitution states that citizens are free to form parties and other social-po-
 litical organizations. However, a controversial article states that those organizations
 that are "engaged in fighting against political pluralism," the "principles of the rule
 of law," or "the sovereignty and independence or territorial integrity' of the country
 are "unconstitutional." Opposition parties, some of which favor rapid or eventual re-
 unification with neighboring Romania, have charged that this provision is intended
 to impede their political activities.
 In 1991 separatist elements, assisted by uniformed Russian military forces in the
 area and led by supporters of the 1991 coup attempt in Moscow, declared a
 "Dniester Republic" in the area of Moldova that is located between the Dniester
 River and Ukraine. Fighting flared briefly in 1992, but ended after Russian forces
 stepped in, and a truce has held since. Russian, Ukrainian, and OSCE mediators
 have attempted-to encourage the two sides to reach a settlement that preserves
 Moldovan sovereignty and independence while granting a measure of autonomy to
 Transnistria. In 1997 the Transnistrian authorities signed a Memorandum of Un-
 derstanding with the Government that encompasses these objectives. However, since
 then further negotiations have been inconclusive and there was no further progress
 towards a settlement by year's end.
 
 
 1391
 There are no restrictions in law or practice on the participation of women or mi-
 norities in political life. However, women generally are underrepresented in leading
 positions both in government and politicalparties. Women hold only 9 of 101 par-
 liamentary seats. The Association of Moldovan Women, a social-political organiza-
 tion, competed in the March elections, but was unable to gain parliamentary rep-
 resentation. Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, and Gagauz minorities are represented
 in Parliament, with deputies elected from nationwide party lists rather than local
 districts. Debate takes place in either the Romanian/Moldovan or Russian language,
 with translation provided.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several local human rights groups exist. The local Helsinki Watch Organization
 maintains contacts with international human rights organizations, as does the Hel-
 sinki Citizens Assembly. Human rights groups operate without government inter-
 ference.
 Citizens may appeal to the European Court in Strasbourg if they believe that
 their rights have been violated or that Moldovan laws are not in accordance with
 the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental
 Freedoms. However, most citizens are unaware of the convention and their rights
 to legal remedies in general.  ,
 The Government has supported the work of the OSCE, which has had a mission
 in the country since 1993 to assist in efforts to bring about a resolution of the sepa-
 ratist conflict. The OSCE participates in the Joint Control Commission-composed
 of Moldovan, Russian, Ukrainian, and Transnistrian members-which reviews viola-
 tions of the cease-fire agreement. The mission generally enjoys access to the "secu-
 rity zone" al9ng the river dividing the separatist-controlled territory from the rest
 of the country.
 The Government has cooperated with ICRC in the past, permitting visits to pris-
 oners from the 1992 conflict (since released). The Transnistrian separatist authori-
 ties previously have not allowed the ICRC access to the four members of the original
 "Ilascu Six' who have remained in prison since 1993. However, the OSCE and the
 HCHR each were able to visit one of the four during the year (see Section i.e.).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that persons are equal before the law regardless of race,
 sex, disability, religion, or social origin. There are remedies for violations, such as
 orders for redress of grievances, but these are not always enforced.
 Women.-Spousal violence is known to occur although there are no reliable statis-
 tics on the problem. A prominent women's rights advocate asserts that 2 of
 Moldovan women are victims of domestic violence. Women abused by their husbands
 have the right to press charges; husbands convicted of such abuse may receive pris-
 on sentences (typically up to 6 months). Public awareness of the problem of violence
 is low and no special government programs exist to combat spousal abuse. A private
 organization operates a confidential service to provide support to abused spouses.
 According to knowledgeable sources, women do not generally appeal to police or the
 courts for protection against abusive spouses because they are embarrassed to do
 so and are not convinced that the authorities would react positively, as the police
 generally do not consider spousal abuse a serious crime. Through September the
 Ministry of Internal Affairs recorded 162 cases of rape of attempted rape, a slight
 decrease from the same period in 1997. Women's groups believe that the numbers
 of rapes and incidents of spousal abuse are underreported.
 Although no statistics are available, trafficking in girls and women is a problem,
 especially to Turkey, Greece, and Israel. Apart from a documentary shown on state
 television on the problem, the Government has taken few steps to prevent the traf-
 ficking of women.
 The law provides that women shall be equal to men. However, according to statis-
 tics, women have been affected disproportionately by growing unemployment. By
 law women are paid the same as men for the same work, although they still are
 victimized by societal discrimination. There are a significant number of female man-
 agers in the public sector and in banking. The president of the country's largest
 bank is a woman.
 Children.-There is extensive legislation designed to protect children, including
 extended paid maternity leave and government supplementary payments for fami-
 lies with many children. Ten years of basic education are compulsory, followed by
 either technical school or further study leading to higher education. The health sys-
 tem devotes extensive resources to child care. Although child abuse does occur occa-
 
 
 1392
 sionally, no special problems came to light during the year. There are no statistics
 on child abuse. Child sup port programs suffered from inadequate funding.
 An estimated 1,000 children are living in the streets of Chisinau and other large
 urban areas.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no legal discrimination against persons with
 disabilities. However, there are no laws providing for accessibility to buildings, and
 there are few government resources devoted to training persons with disabilities.
 The Government does provide tax advantages to charitable groups that assist the
 disabled.
 Religious Minorities.-Tension between Eastern Orthodox supporters and Protes-
 tant groups spread to the parliamentary election campaign. During the parliamen-
 tary campaign, a number of newspaper articles attacked one party for including a
 Baptist minister on its ist of canidates. These and other articles strongly de-
 nounced Protestantism in favor of Orthodoxy. A senior member of the Orthodox hi-
 erarchy allegedly warned a patty leader that the Church would destroy the party's
 election campaign if it did not remove the Baptist candidate. However, the minister
 gained a seat in Parliament.                                        _
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The population is about 4.3 million, of which
 65 percent are ethnic Moldovans. tlrainians (14 percent) and Russians (13 percent)
 are the two largest minorities. A Christian Turkic minority, the Gagauz, lives pri-
 marily in the southern regions of the country. The Gagauz are largely Russian-
 speaking and represent about 3.5 percent of the population. Official statistics put
 the Roma population at 11,600, although estimates from the OSCE and Roma non-
 governmental organizations range from 50,000 to 200,000.
 There was an unconfirmed NGO report of two police officers beating Roma in
 Soroca in an incident in 1997.
 The 1990 citizenship law offered an equal opportunity to all persons residing in
 the country at the time of independence to adopt Moldovan citizenship. The OSCE's
 Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights described the law as being very
 liberal. The law permits dual citizenship on the basis of a bilateral agreement, but
 no such agreements are in effect.
 Implementation of language testing by 1994, which was called for in the 1989 lan-
 guage law, has not yet begun. According to the law, a citizen should be able to
 choose which language to use in dealing with government officials or commercial en-
 tities. Officials are obligated to know Russian and Romaniani/Moldovan "to the de-
 gree necessary to fulfill their professional obligations." Since many Russian speakers
 do not speak Romanian/Moldovan (while educated Moldovans speak both lan-
 guages), they argued for a delay in the implementation of the law in order to permit
 more time to learn the language. Parliament has postponed implementation indefi-
 nitely. Addressing a minority concern, the Constitution provides parents with the
 right to choose the language of instruction for their children.
 However, in the separatist Transnistrian region discrimination against Romanian/
 Moldovan speakers continued. State schools are required to use the Cyrillic alphabet
 when teaching Romanian. Many teachers, parents, and students objected to the use
 of the Cyrillic script to teach Romanian. They believe that it disadvantages pupils
 who wish to pursue higher education opportunities in the rest of the country or Ro-
 mania. (Cyrillic script was used to write the Romanian language in Moldova until
 1989, since "Moldovan," as it was then called, was decreed officially during the So-
 viet era to be a different language from Romanian, which is written in the Latin
 alphabet. The 1989 language law reinstituted the use of the Latin script.) As a re-
 sult of an agreement between the Government and the separatist authorities, eight
 schools in the separatist region obtained permission in 1996 to use the Latin alpha-
 bet, with salaries and textbooks to-be supplied by the Moldovan Ministry of Edu-
 cation. These schools are considered private schools by the local authorities. They
 must pay rent for their facilities and meet local curriculum requirements, building
 codes, and safety standards. The Government has no budgetary provisions for the
 high rents asked for these facilities. As a result, classes were held in local homes
 or run in shifts in the few available buildings.
 After delaying its opening and threatening to keep it closed, the separatist au-
 thorities allowed the Romanian Language School (Latin alphabet) in Tiraspol to
 open in September.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1990 Soviet law on trade unions enacted by
 Moldova's then-Supreme Soviet remains in effect and provides for independent trade
 unions. Laws passed in 1989 and 1991, which give citizens the'right to form all
 kinds of social organizations, also provide a legal basis for the formation of inde-
 pendent unions. The 1994 Constitution states that any employee may found a union
 
 
 1393
 or join a union that defends workers' interests. However, there have been no known
 successful attempts to establish alternate trade union structures independent of the
 successor to the previous official organizations that were part of the Soviet trade
 union system.
 The successor organization is the General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU).
 The GFTU's continuing role in managing the state insurance system and its reten-
 tion of former official union headquarters and vacation facilities provide an inherent
 advantage over any newcomers who might wish to form a union. However, its indus-
 trial or branch unions are becoming more independent entities; they maintain that
 their membership in the GFTU is voluntary and that they can withdraw if they
 wish. Virtually all employed adults are members of a union.
 Government workers do not have the right to strike, nor do those in essential
 services such as health care and energy. Other unions may strike if two-thirds of
 the members vote- for a strike in a secret ballot. There were several labor actions
 for payment of wage arrears, including a number of strikes by teachers, health care
 workers, and spouses of police officers in various parts of the country. School open-
 ings, originally scheduled for September 1, were delayed in many places due to
 teachers' strikes over unpaid salaries. On December 4, approximately 5,000 protest-
 ers gathered in front of the main government building in Chisinau to call for the
 payment of wage and, pension arrears to government workers. Many government
 employees, especially in the education and health sectors, had not been paid for
 months. The GFTU organized the protest.
 Unions may affiliate and maintain contacts with international organizations. The
 GFTU became a member of the International Confederation of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law, which is based on
 former Soviet legislation, provides for collective bargaining rights. However, wages
 are set through a tripartite negotiation process involving government, management,
 and unions. The three parties meet and negotiate national minimum wages for all
 categories of workers. Then, each branch union representing a particular industry
 negotiates with management and the government ministries responsible for that in-
 dustry. They may set wages higher than the minimum set on the national level and
 often do, especially if the industry in question is more profitable than average. Fi-
 nally, on the enterprise level, union and management representatives negotiate di-
 rectly on wages. Again, they may set wages higher than negotiators on the industry
 level.
 There were no reports of actions taken against union members for union activi-
 ties. The 1990 Soviet law on trade unions provides that union leaders may not be
 fired from their jobs while in leadership positions or for a period after they leave
 those positions. There were no reports of such firings this year.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 and compulsory labor, and it is not known to occur. The Government specifically
 prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and there were no reports that it oc-
 curred.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum age for unrestricted employment is 18 years. Employment of those between
 the ages of 16 and 18 is permitted under special conditions, including shorter work-
 days, no night shifts, and longer vacations. The Ministry of Labor, Social Protection,
 and the Family isprimarily responsible for enforcing these restrictions, and the
 Ministry of Health also has a role. Child labor is not used in industry, although chil-
 dren living in rural areas sometimes assist in the agricultural sector. Ten years of
 education are compulsory. The Government specifically prohibits forced and bonded
 labor by children, and there were no reports that it occurred (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Wor.-There is a legal minimum monthly wage of
 $3.50 (18 Moldovan lei), but this is used primarily as a basis for calculating fines.
 The average monthly wage of approximately $45 (193 Moldovan lei) does not provide
 a decent standard of living for a worker and family. The lowest wages are in the
 agicul   al sector, where the monthly average is approximately $24.50 (113
 Moldovan lei). Due to severe budgetary constraints, the Government and enterprises
 often do not meet payrolls for employees. The Constitution sets the maximum work-
 week at 40 hours, and the Labor Code provides for at least 1 day offper week.
 The State is required to set and check safety standards in the workplace. The
 unions within the GFTU also have inspection personnel who have a right to stop
 work in the factory or fine the enterprise if safety standards are not met. Further,
 workers have the right to refuse to work but may continue to draw their salaries
 if working conditions represent a serious threat to their health. However, in practice
 the depressed economic situation has led enterprises to economize on safety equip-
 
 
 1394
 ment and generally to show less concern for worker safety issues. Workers often do
 not know their rights in this area.
