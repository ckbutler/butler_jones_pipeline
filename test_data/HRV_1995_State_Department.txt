 CROATIA
 The Pepublic of Croatia is a constitutional parliamentary democracy with a pow-
 erful presidency. President Franjo Tudjman, elected in 1992, serves as head of state
 and commander in chief of the armed forces. He chairs the influential National De-
 fense and Security Council, and appoints the Prime Minister, who leads the Govern-
 ment. President Tudjman's party, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), holds the
 majority of seats in both houses of Parliament, and the HDZ has ruled Croatia since
 independence in 1991. A new Government was named in November after multiparty
 elections were held for the lower house of Parliament. Government influence weak-
 ens the nominally independent judiciary. The enormous constitutional powers of the
 presidency, the military occupation of large sections of the country, and the over-
 whelming dominance of one political party tend to stifle the expression of diverse
 views.
 In March the United Nations protective Force (UNPROFOR) mandate was modi-
 fied to include monitoring of the international borders of Croatia and an increased
 presence of human rights monitors in the U.N. protected areas. The mission was
 renamed the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation (UNCRO). In May
 and August, the Government launched military offensives against three rebel Serb-
 held zones and recovered the territory after 4 years of breakaway Serb occupation.
 The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that a pproximately 180,000
 Serb refugees fled into Serb-controlled territory in Bosnia and Croatia and Serbia/
 Montenegro during the two campaigns. Only the Eastern area of Croatia remains
 outside effective government control, although both the Government and local Serb
 leaders signed an agreement in mid-November to bring this area under complete
 government control after a transitional period of 1 to 2 years. Abuses continued in
 rebel Sefr-held areas. Tens of thousands of expelled Croat and Muslim refugees con-
 tinued to arrive from Serbia and Bosnia.
 The Ministry of the Interior oversees the police, while the Ministry of Defense
 oversees the armed forces (HV). Civil police have no authority over military police
 or over uniformed military personnel. The national police have primary responsibil-
 ity for internal security, but in times of disorder, for example, during and after the
 May and August offensives, the Government may call on the army to provide secu-
 rity. Both the police and army are responsible for external security. Civilian authori-
 ties generally maintain effective control of the professional security forces. However,
 official personnel from each service were responsible for significant abuses commit-
 ted in the reclaimed territories. In Serb-controlled areas, we I-armed police and mili-
 tary forces continued their pattern of human rights abuses against both non-Serbs
 and Serbs.
 Croatia's economy is slowly changing to a market-based free enterprise system.
 Industry is largely state owned.
 Agriculture is mostly in private hands. Family-owned small enterprises are mul-
 tiplying. The stabilization program kept inflation low throughout the year. The con-
 tinued occupation of the eastern area by rebel Serbs, the massive refugee problem,
 and the two military offensives all limited economic recovery. The slow transition
 and the war economy contributed to polarizing economic disparities.
 There were serious human rights problems during the year, the most flagrant vio-
 lations being committed during and after the May and August military operations.
 Although the Government generally respected the human rights of ethmc Croats,
 its human rights record worsened with respect to minority  ups, especially ethnic
 Serbs. The bulk of violent abuses occurred in the reclaimed regions, after the mili-
 tary and police operations. The Government failed to establish adequate civil au-
 thority to control vengeful renegade arsonists, looters, and murderers who still opr-
 ated with impunity in the reclaimed areas months -aer the offensives had endd.
 The Government sought to legalize and institutionalize the population changes re-
 
 
 820
 suiting from these offensives, rather than welcome back Serb refugees. After the
 military actions, it appeared less than genuinely interested in devising measures to
 restore confidence in the Serbian community, or even in maintaining an ethnic Serb
 presence in Croatia. The security forces committed, cooperated in, or ignored many
 of the abuses in the reclaimed areas. The Government did not effectively seek out
 or punish those involved, except in a few token cases. The Government temporarily
 suspended key provisions of the National Minorities law in September and still has
 not established the provisional human rights court, as mandated by the 1992 Con-
 stitution. Specific abuses committed included ethnic-based killings, arbitrary deten-
 tion and torture, restrictions of movement and repatriation, mass destruction and
 confiscation of property, denial of fair and expeditious trials, and infringements on
 freedom of speech and the press. Societal discrimination against women and ethnic
 minorities and violence against women are problems.
 Rebel Serb authorities committed human rights abuses in the areas they con-
 trolled. The police and military forces continued to use violence, murder, intimida-
 tion, and displacement against Croats and minorities to settle incoming Serb refu-
 gees and achieve their goal of ethnic cleansing in the areas they controlled. In May,
 provoked by the Government attack on Western Slavonia, the self-proclaimed "Re-
 public of Serbian Krajina (RSK)" President Martic ordered the bombing of Croatian
 civilian centers, including Zagreb. At least six civilians died in these incidents. Resi-
 dents of the "RSK" were subject to a controlled, quasi-legal system that operated
 without freedom of expression, assembly, press, religion, or movement and which de-
 nied citizens the right to change their government.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and other Extrajudicial Killing.-UNCRO officials registered 300 to
 500 reports of killings in reclaimed parts of Croatia. Most killings were ethnically
 motivated and occurred long after the military offensives were over. Only in the
 most public cases were effective government investigations carried out and perpetra-
 tors punished, mostly as a result of pressure from international authorities and
 human rights groups. Among those implicated in the killings were civilians, civil po-
 lice, and active duty military personnel, especially members of the nonprofessional
 "home guard" brigades.
 There were numerous and brutal killings. For example, in late August, seven el-
 derly civilians were shot, slaughtered, and burned in the village of Grubori. The old-
 est victim was 90 years old. Witnesses saw uniformed special police and HV at the
 scene. At first, government officials claimed that the civilians were caught in a clash
 between HV and enemy troops. Months later a few Croats were arrested for the
 murder of these civilians and were still under investigation at year's end. On Sep-
 tember 28, in the village of Varivode, UNCRO monitors found the bodies of nine el-
 derly Serbs who had been shot to death. Thirteen individuals were arrested for
 these killings. At the end of the year, the Government claimed that it had inves-
 tigated 26 murders and resolved 15 cases, charging a total of 20 individuals, includ-
 in 3 soldiers and 1 policeman.
 Serbs in the occupied areas also committed ethnically motivated killings within
 the sectors and along the confrontation line, with a disproportionate number of non-
 Serb victims. For example, in June three Croat garbage collectors were kidnaped by
 East Slavonian Serbs during a regular run to the Osijek city dump inside the sepa-
 ration zone. Two individuals were released, but Serb authorities in Erdut eventually
 claimed that the third, Franjo Ivos, was killed. No suspects were ever apprehended
 and local authorities insist that the body was lost. In October Serb snipers from this
 sector killed two Croats in Belisce. Rebel Serbs also targeted U.N. personnel. A Ken-
 yan UNCRO soldier was shot dead in July in sector south. In January in sector
 east, one Russian battalion soldier and three local Serbs were shot under unclear
 circumstances, possibly involving black market activity. In September four Danish
 U.N. soldiers were killed near Dor as Bosnian Serbs deliberately targeted a U.N.
 observation post across the Una river in Croatia. HV units had attempted to cross
 the river, and fire was exchanged between the two sides. UNCRO officials claim
 that the position of a tank's gun indicated that it had targeted U.N., and not HV,
 positions.
 No progress was made on the excavation of mass grave sites in occupied areas
 until Croatian forces obtained control of the territory. Government sources claim to
 have located over 250 mass graves in the former Serb-occupied territories, and the
 Government began uncovering some of the sites. After many of the bodies were
 identified, they were released-into the custody of family members. Based on eye-
 
 
 witness reports, the Government charged individual rebel Serbs with murder, some
 of whom were tried in absentia.
 b. Disappearance.-Few new cases of disappearances were reported. At year's end,
 the Government reported more than 2,800 cases of missing persons still unresolved
 from the 1991-92 war. Some progress was made in removing names from the list
 of those missing as a result of prisoner and body exchanges and of identification of
 corpses exhumed in the reclaimed areas. An unknown number of cases of missing
 Serbs remained open at the end of the year as a result of the two government
 offensives. The Government made no public effort to investigate these cases.
 c. Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture or cruel or degrading punishment, but govern-
 ment forces continued to commit such abuses in some instances. Security forces at
 certain prisons beat and mistreated prisoners during detention and interrogation.
 After both offensives, foreign observers saw the wounds of rebel Serb detainees who
 complained of such treatment at detention centers, in Varazdin in May, for example,
 as well as at other sites. However, such cases were not routine, and there was no
 evidence of systematic torture in Croatian jails. Most Serb detainees interviewed by
 international monitors reported good treatment. There were no reports of abuses or
 mistreatment of common criminals arrested and detained in Croatian jails.
 Except for the short-term detention facilities used to house civilians rounded u
 after the military actions, detention facilities generally meet minimum internation
 standards of cleanliness, nutrition, and ameities. Jails are crowded, but not to ex-
 cess, and family visits and access to counsel are available. Detained rebel Serbs ar-
 rested for armed rebellion were mainly held in military prisons, as with most secu-
 rity prisoners. After the August offensive, the Government increasingly restricted
 access to these Serb prisoners by UNCRO and other international observers until
 late in the year.
 There were credible reports of torture and other abuse in Serb-controlled areas.
 Harsh treatment of non-Serbs was commonplace, and Serbian authorities did not
 punish abusers. In March a British citizen of Croatian descent was detained for a
 month in Knin and tortured with electric implements. Two of the three Ojisek gar-
 bage collectors kidnaped by East Slavonian Serbs (see Section L.a.) complained that
 they were tortured and otherwise mistreated during their detention. Local police
 and paramilitary forces reportedly beat and robbed detainees, as well as subjected
 them to psychological torture, such as death threats. Prison conditions in the Serb-
 controlled areas were reliably reported to be abysmal.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution contains provisions to
 protect the legal rights of all accused, but the Government does not always respect
 these rights in ractice. The Government frequently abuses pretrial and investiga-
 tive detention. The most prominent case of arbitrary arrest occurred in late October
 when 15 persons, mostly prominent ethnic Serbs, were detained for espionage. The
 court eventually charged the suspects after holding them in detention for 3 months.
 Army speciai forces troops arbitrarily arrested several dozen rebel Bosnian Muslim
 refugees in the Kup]jensko camp at the end of the year and forcibly repatriated
 them to Bosnia. Refugee organizations continued to report similar instances in
 which Muslim refugees were detained and threatened with forcible expulsion.
 Government police and military forces rounded up the remaining civilian popu-
 lations of the formerly occupied areas immediately after both offensives. The elderly,
 women, and children were confined in collection centers outside the war zone, some
 for several weeks. Government officials explained that this measure was taken for
 detainees' own safety, until their "identificaticn" was verified, and their homes were
 demined. Many homes were looted during their absence. Draft age men were taken
 to separate centers and held even longer until a determination was made whether
 to investigate them either for war crimes or for armed rebellion. Over 1,500 men
 were detained after the attack on Western Slavonia, about 200 of whom were inves-
 tigated at length. The Government extended the amnesty for armed rebellion to
 cover the period from August 17, 1990, to May 10, 1995.
 Police normally seek arrest warrants by presenting evidence of probable cause to
 an interrogating magistrate. Police may carry out arrests without a warrant if they
 believe the suspect might flee, destroy evidence, or commit other crimes. Such cases
 are not uncommon. The police then have 24 hours in which to justify their decision
 before the local interrogating magistrate.
 After arrest, the law states that persons must be given access to an attorney of
 their choice within 24 hours; if they have no attorney, and are charged with a crime
 for which the sentence is over 10 years' imprisonment, the interrogating magistrate
 will appoint counsel from a list of public defenders. If the sentence is under 10
 years, detainees can request court-appointed counsel if they so choose. The court
 will appoint counsel after charges are levied for the trial. The interrogating judge
 
 
 822
 
 must, within 3 days of the arrest, decide whether sufficient cause exists to hold the
 person in custody pending further investigation. The judge must justify the decision
 in writing, including the length of detention ordered. These decisions may be ap-
 pealed, either immediately or later in the detention period. The usual period of in-
 vestigative detention varies from a few days to a few weeks but by law may be as
 long as 2 years. Those persons held under investigative detention are often denied
 certain rights, such as visits, until they are officially charged. Accused persons have
 the right to have their attorney present whenever they wish during the investiga-
 tion as well as during any appeal of investigative detention.
 In practice, detainees are almost always bound over for investigation unless it is
 clear that no case exists against them. Once the investigation is complete, detainees
 are usually released on their own recognizance pending trial, unless the crime is a
 major offense, the accused are considered public dangers, or the court believes they
 may flee. There are provisions for posting bail after charges are brought, but the
 practice is not common. Police will sometimes retain the passports of those released
 pending trial to prevent them from leaving the country.
 By law rebel Serbs detained after the two offensives could be held under inves-
 tigative detention, pending charges, for 6 months. In many cases, "RSK" Serbs ar-
 rested for armed rebellion did not have adequate access to legal counsel, nor were
 they informed in a timely manner by the courts of their rights. Few were assigned
 a public defender until months after their arrest; some saw counsel only once or
 twice, usually only during a court hearing. Although they had been in investigative
 detention for 6 months, many such Serbs were tried and convicted in 2 days in No-
 vember and December, having spoken to their lawyers only once. On December 20,
 the Government amnestied and released an additional 455 rebel Serbs arrested in
 August.
 In rebel Serb-controlled areas, virtually no safeguards existed against arbitrary
 detention, and Serb forces continued to use detention as an intimidation tactic. They
 commonly arrested civilians in the "separation zone." The incident involving the
 Osijek garbage collectors was the most highly publicized. In January a French jour-
 nalist was arrested for illegally crossing into "RSK" territory and was sentenced by
 a military court to 22 years in prison, although he has since been released. In No-
 vember two Americans were detained for 3 days by Vukovar local authorities for
 taking pictures. In November and December, sector east authorities arrested a man
 from Hungary and a Croat from Osijek, each of whom had "trespassed" onto Serb
 territory. Until August residents of the "Bihac pocket" in western Bosnia-
 Herzegovina were sometimes arbitrarily detained while transiting Serb-held terri-
 to~?e Constitution prohibits the exile of Croatian citizens. Serbs captured during
 the offensives who did not originate from Croatian territory were subject to deporta-
 tion after they served their sentences for war crimes.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.--Government influence weakens the nominally
 independent judiciary. For example, during regularly-held judicial elections in 1994,
 a dispute arose which raised concerns about the extent of political control over the
 judiciary. In February the High Judicial Council, which is controlled by the Ministry
 of Justice and the Ministry of Administration, elected new judges for the Supreme
 Court. However, the Constitutional Court ordered that the nominating procedure be
 redone, claiming that the Council had not appointed qualified personnel. Chief Su-
 preme Court Justice Milan Vukovic lost his appointment. Minister of Justice Ivica
 Crnic disputed the election procedures and resigned in March, saying that he did
 not wish to be involved in an undemocratic and totalitarian procedure.
 The Croatian judicial system consists of municipal and district courts, a Constitu-
 tional Court, a Supreme Court, an Administrative Court and a High Judicial Coun-
 cil. The High Judicial Council (with a president and 14 members from all parts of
 the legal community) appoints judges and public prosecutors. The upper house of
 Parliament nominates persons for membership on the High Judicial Council, and
 the lower house elects members to 8-year terms. The eleven judges of the Constitu-
 tional Court are elected to 8-year terms in the same manner.
 In September the Government repealed certain provisions of the 1992 Constitu-
 tional Law on Minorities, which included the establishment of a Provisional Court
 of Human Rights, a court which had never been established (see Section 3). Emer-
 tncy measures established in 1991 are still being applied. These orders provide for
 e suspension of certain legal remedies in legal proceedings and give the six-court
 military legal system jurisdiction over a large number of cases involving civilians.
 Although the Constitution provides for the right to a fair trial and a variety of
 due process rights in both civilian and military courts, in practice the prosecuting
 attorney has leeway in deciding whether to bring a case against an individual, and,
 
 
 823
 
 in cases considered "political," both the indictment and the conduct of trials are
 sometimes subject to outside influence.
 Nor is the judicial process free of ethnic bias. The investigative detention of rebel
 Serbs was often based on circumstantial evidence and uncertain testimony. Court
 authorities, including the detainees' own court-appointed defense counsel, often dis-
 played a strong bias against them. A majority of judges took month-long vacations
 in mid-August, further postponing investigative hearings. Large numbers of detain-
 ees never received legal counsel. International trial observers claimed that witnesses
 often recanted or changed their stories, presumably due to intimidation on behalf
 of the accused.
 The legal system in the Serb-controlled regions remained a sham, with its proce-
 dures and practices totally subject to interference by those in power. Specific infor-
 mation is hard to come by, as these proceedings are closed to monitoring by the UN
 and other international observers.
 The estimated number of political prisoners, including Serbs who remained in de-
 tention, was over 500.
 f. Arbitray Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution declares the home inviolable. Only a court may issue a search warrant,
 stating the justification for the search of a home or other premises. Police may enter
 a home without a warrant or the owner's consent only if necessary to enforce an
 arrest warrant, apprehend a suspect, or prevent serious danger to life or important
 property. In practice, the authorities often failed to adhere to these constitutional
 requirements.
 International observers witnessed the mass looting, destruction, and burning of
 proprty in the reclaimed territories by both official military and civilian personnel
 and by unhindered civilians allowed to roam the area. Within days of the start of
 the May and August offensives, the first cases of house burnings were reported.
 Over one-third of-the buildings in the former sectors north and south were burned
 within 2 months of the August offensive. Another third was heavily damaged and
 uninhabitable. The village of Donji Lapac and many others with a predominant Serb
 population were burned to the ground. From early August until the end of the year,
 international human rights monitors repre   diyncetsoloigbrning,
 and threats made to the remaining local population. Monitors continually reported
 the names and automobile license numbers of perpetrators to government authori-
 ties. Most people detained for looting and arson were released after questioning
 pending further investigation. Security personnel and military commanders gen-
 erally aid nothing to stop this destruction, and local and international observers
 often witnessed security forces starting the fires or standing by as they burned. Offi-
 cial investigations and prosecutions for these acts began only after intense inter-
 national and media pressure on the Government and were viewed as neither serious
 nor complete. At years end, the Government reported to the U.N. that it had reg-
 istered 2,878 cases of arson and brought charges against 11 persons. It had identi-
 fied 1,054 cases of looting, of which 770 had been "clarified," and had charged 1,260
 individuals. The Government provided no supporting documentation for these
 claims.
 In August an official decree placed under government administration the aban-
 doned property of citizens who had fled the country for Serbia or other Serb-con-
 trolled areas since the 1991 war. The Government claimed that this act was nec-
 essary to give Croat refugees decent shelter and to protect the properties from
 looting and destruction. The decree was viewed internationally as a thinly veiled at-
 tempt to prevent the return of Croatian Serbs to their homes. However, it was im-
 mediately passed into law by the HDZ-controlled legislature. Owners were allowed
 a 90-day filing period to reclaim their property, but the new law's complex proce-
 dures required a claimant to produce citizenship documents which could not be ob-
 tained outside Croatia, and to file a claim in Croatia. Both requirements were prac-
 tical impediments to Croatian Serbs' efforts to reclaim their property. The time limit
 for filing a claim was subsequently lifted in January 1996. Although the Govern-
 ment eventually set up processing centers in Belgrade and other nearby capitals,
 the procedure remained slow.
 Military and civil police continued to carry out forced evictions, involving hun-
 dreds of families of all nationalities. In other cases, Croatian refugees, often with
 the appearance of official countenance, forcibly entered the homes of ethnic Serbs
 and other minorities who had lived for years in family apartments, but who were
 themselves not listed as the official tenant. Although such evictions were often de-
 clared illegal in court, authorities forbade the police to remove the intruders on the
 basis of a law which requires that a new home be found for a displaced or refugee
 family before it can be removed from any form of housing, whether it was legaly
 occupying the housing or not.
 
 
 Forced evictions of ethnic Serbs, Croats, and others from former Yugoslav Na-
 tional Army (JNA) apartments continued. The Ministry of Defense arbitrarily re-
 voked the tenant rights of individuals who had lived in the apartments for decades.
 Referring to property laws which remove tenancy rights as a result of any 6-month
 absence, or if the tenant was ruled to have acted against the interests of the Repub-
 lic of Croatia, the Ministry granted soldiers tenancy of these occupied flats. The sol-
 diers frequently took residences by force of arms, either evicting the current tenants
 or forcing them to share the quarters. In November the Government passed a law
 allowing former JNA apartments to be privatized. Unlike other privatizations, legal
 tenants had restricted rights to purchase their apartments, and the right to pur-
 chase was not guaranteed. Family members of the registered tenant were not al-
 lowed purchase rights, nor were individuals suspected of armed rebellion or war
 crimes. Human rights groups plan to sue the Government concerning the constitu-
 tionality of this law.
 The Constitution provides for the secrecy and safety of personal data, but it was
 unclear if such guarantees were observed in practice.
 Leaders in the Serb-held regions showed no compunction about interfering with
 the rights of the inhabitants of those areas, particularly non-Serbs. UNCRO contin-
 ued to provide 24-hour patrols of several minority villages to protect the inhabitants
 from armed bands. The practice of forcibly moving Serb ian refugees or soldiers into
 the homes of non-Serb residents continued as well.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-In the early morning hours of May 1, special police units and government
 troops initiated "Operation Flash," an attack to liberate occupied Western Slavonia.
 Announced as a "limited police action" to gain control of the Zagreb-Lipovac high-
 way, government forces gained effective control of most of the area within 1 day,
 and a cease-fire was reached on the afternoon of May 3. HV troops restricted the
 movement of UNCRO forces and surrounded most U.N. bases, including a Jordanian
 base along the highway and a Nepalese base at Pustara. Although tensions had
 been building for many weeks, the direct pretext for the attack was the murder of
 three Croats, who were shot on the highway by a sniper from behind Serb lines.
 Rebel Serb forces reacted by shelling several cities, including Zagreb, Dubrovnik,
 Karlovac, Kutina, Nova Gradiska, Novska, Pakrac, Osijek, Sisak, and Zupanja. Za-
 greb was shelled on two separate occasions with Orkan anti-personnel cluster
 bombs. Among the sites hit were a children's hospital and the national theater. The
 shelling resulted in 6 dead and more than 130 wounded. "RSK" president Milan
 Martic publicly announced that he had personally issued the order for the capital
 to be shelled. Days later, he threatened again to "flatten the city" and kill "100,000
 people." In October Martic was indicted with two other "RSK officials" by the Inter-
 national Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for this incident.
 Over 7,000 Serb refugees fled in front of advancing HV troops over the only bridge
 across the Sava river to Serb-held Bosnian territory. Government forces left this
 road open to allow the inhabitants to evacuate. A pocket of Serbs unable to leave
 the northern part of the sector was surrounded by HV forces and surrendered.
 On August 4, government forces launched the larger scale "Operation Storm" on
 the former sectors north and south, and gained effective control of the area within
 5 days. The attack began with the shelling of the Serb stronghold of Knin, a civilian
 target. Rebel Serb forces organized a weak counteroffensive and quickly prepared
 an evacuation of both military and civilian personnel from the area. Bosnian Serbs
 shelled several cities in government-controlled Croatia although Zagreb was not hit.
 Although reportedly ordered to stay away from civilian targets, government forces
 were responsible for the indiscriminate deaths of many civilians and U.N. personnel
 during both actions. The Government later claimed that 188 Serbs had been killed
 during the May action, of which 54 deaths were civilian. After the August attack,
 the Government announced that 116 Serbs and 42 Croat civilians had been killed,
 as well as 402 "RSK" soldiers and 211 HV troops. UNCRO estimates of these figures
 are higher. During "Operation Flash," the U.N. reported 30 civilian corpses near the
 village of Novi Varos. Eyewitnesses reported soldiers shooting at fleeing refugees.
 On August 8 near Dvor, Croatian air force planes fired on a Serb refugee column
 fleeing into Bosnia. The Government claimed that the Serbs were moving tanks and
 other heavy equipment in the same column. One woman died from wounds she re-
 ceived when a refugee column was stoned on August 9 by onlookers in Sisak. That
 same day, a British journalist was killed and two other persons were wounded near
 Vrginmost, mistakenly targeted as Serbs by HV forces.
 Bosnian government army (ABH) forces entered Croatia during the August offen-
 sive with Croatian government consent. While escorting a refugee column in August,
 UNCRO personnel witnessed the deliberate shooting of 9 to 11 mentally and phys-
 
 
 825
 ically handicapped Serb refugees by irregular units of the ABH. ABH forces also
 shelled a Serb refugee column in Donji Zirovac on August 8.
 During the offensives, the U.N. suffered casualties from both sides. HV forces
 threatened and captured U.N. observation posts, holding some personnel hostage for
 several hours. These forces looted many abandoned U.N. compounds. When HV
 troops entered Knin in August, they prevented anyone from leaving the U.N.
 compound to monitor the fighting. A Danish UNCRO soldier was used by rebel
 Serbs as a human shield and was killed by HV fire. The officer responsible for the
 order to shoot was arrested and a murder charge is pending against him. -V forces
 threw a grenade into a Jordanian battalion bunker, resulting in 4 to 6 deaths (also
 see Section L.a.).
 Both police and military forces were responsible for looting and the destruction
 of property, includingithe mining and burning of houses. This destruction continued
 many months after the completion of the action and was later committed by roving
 civilians as well (see Section 1.f.)
 Elsewhere, isolated ceaselire violations caused at least three fatalities. Occasional
 shelling occurred throughout the year from Bosnian Serb positions bordering Cro-
 atia, most commonly targeting Zupanja, Osijek, and the Dubrovnik area. Dubrovnik
 airport was shelled in April, May, August, and October. Three young adults were
 killed in a suburb of Dubrovnik from indiscriminate shelling in October. These at-
 tacks also caused substantial property damage.
 Several deaths occurred throughout the year from mines. The wide extent of
 mine-laying during the conflict was increasingly evident after HV forces gained con-
 trol of the three sectors. Soldiers and civilians from both sides, as well as UNCRO
 personnel, were victims of unmarked and uncleared minefields. Expulsions of
 Croats, Hungarians, Slovaks, Czechs, and other non-Serbs continued in Serb-occu-
 pied areas throughout the year, with the number of incidents increasing in the re-
 maining Serb-held territories after each of the two government attacks. Condoned
 by local RSK officials, these expulsions served the goal of ethnic cleansing by rid-
 ding the region of minorities.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of
 thought and expression, specifically including freedom of the press and other media
 of communication, speech, and public expression, and free establishment of institu-
 tions of public communication. In practice, government influence on the media
 through state ownership of most print and broadcast outlets limits these freedoms.
 In addition, government intimidation induces self-censorship. Journalists are some-
 times reluctant to criticize the Government in public forums for fear of harassment,
 job loss, intimidation, or being labeled as disloyal to Croatia.
 The national television broadcasting and radio broadcasting system (HRT) is gov-
 ernment controlled. The Government also retains a controlling interest in two of
 four news dailies and some weekly newspapers. Although these state-controlled or
 heavily state-influenced media frequently carry reportage critical of the Govern-
 ment, they maintain an overall editorial slant favorable to the Government and the
 governing party, the HDZ. Both the broadcast and print media also often exclude
 news reports that put Croatia or its government in an unfavorable light. HRT has
 several times not broadcast statements by foreign diplomats made in highly public
 forums on the need to observe human and minority rights. Each of the opposition
 parties is allocated 4 minutes of television time per week. Access by the parties to
 the print media is minimal, with occasional coverage of press conferences and inter-
 views.
 During October's parliamentary elections, 1 hour of free broadcast time on na-
 tional television was made available to each of the registered political parties for
 the pre-election campaign. Time slots were drawn by lot. Paid advertising on na-
 tional television was, in theory, available, but HRT refused to run advertising spots
 from one of the major opposition parties on the grounds that some (unspecified) in-
 formation in the ad was inaccurate and that the ad did not make clear which party
 was placing it. The HDZ advertising budget dwarfed that of its rivals, and it made
 heavy use of this budget to buy broadcast time on the national, state-controlled tele-
 vision network during the election campaign.
 A few newspapers continue to guard their independence, including the daily Novi
 List in Rijeka, the weekly Globus, the intellectual bimonthly jourunal Erasn, and
 the weekly Arkzin, published by the Antiwar Campaign.
 Some extremist publications, with a virulently antigovernment slant, can be pur-
 chased at newsstands, although they have a very small circulation. The highly popu-
 lar and often critical weekly Feral Tribune was subjected to a 50 percent turnover
 
 
 tax in 1994, though in March, under pressure from the European Union, the tax
 was lifted by the Constitutional Court.
 Government influence over the recently privatized distribution network, coupled
 with stiff value added taxes levied at several points durn  the roduction process,
 also has an impact on press freedom. It is claimed, though difficult to prove, that
 the few companies able to print newspapers do not charge the progovernment media
 for their services; it is also widely believed that Tisak, the national distributor for
 all newspapers and magazines, removes independent journals very quickly from its
 newsstands while at the same time charging them a high percentage of the cover
 price for its services. Certain independent newspapers and magazines claim that
 they must pay out more than 50 percent of their gross revenues for taxes and dis-
 tribution costs alone. On the other hand, the high circulation of some popular inde-
 pendent periodicals, Globus being the most visible example, has given them enough
 financial independence to thrive despite these high taxes and high costs.
 International papers andjournals remained available throughout government-con-
 trolled areas, including Serbin perodicals which subscribers continued to receive
 by mail.
 Croatia has three national television channels and a local television station in Za-
 greb which reaches a quarter of the population. Zagreb-based Channels One, Two,
 and Three are part of HRT, the official Croatian Radio and Television Enterprise,
 headed by a well-known HDZ member. Regional stations operate in Zadar, Split,
 Vinkovci, and Osqek.
 In August Parliament announced the first allocations of frequencies for regional
 private radio and television stations under the July 1994 Broadcast Law. (No fre-
 quencies for nationwide private broadcasters have been assigned for either radio or
 television.) Two of 4 planned frequencies for television and 4 of 20 planned fre-
 quencies for radio at the county (zupanija) level were assigned. Nine of 15 planned
 frequencies for municipal-level private television were assigned and 88 of 111
 planned frequencies for municipal radio broadcasters were assigned.
 The Broadcast Law mandates that one parliamentary member of the Council for
 Croatian Television be an ethnic minority representative, but this person has not
 yet been apin   Among the first acts the Government undertook after its forces
 retook theXrajina was tolegin broadcasting programming from the HRT regional
 station in Kni.
 In Serb-controlled regions freedom of speech and the press virtually did not exist.
 With martial law still in effect, there were no guarantees of a free press and other
 freedoms, and the authorities controlled the tone and content of the media. One tele-
 vision station broadcasts from studios in Beli Manastir and Vukovar in the one re-
 maining Serb-occupied area at year's end. A few low-powered local radio stations
 broadcast from Baranja and Eastern Slavonia. Government radio and television
 broadcasts are received in these areas as well.
 Academic freedom is generally respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides that
 all citizens have the right to peaceful assembly and association for the protection
 of citizens' interests or the promotion of social, economic, political, national, cultural,
 and other convictions and objectives, and the Government respects these provisions
 in practice.
 I early December, over 2,000 Croat refugees gathered in Zagreb for the largest
 antigovernment demonstration since independence to protest the Dayton peace
 agreement and the loss of their homes in Bosnian Posavina to Bosnian Serbs. The
 demonstration was mostly peaceful with a few isolated incidents of police harass-
 ment of protestors.
 In Serb-controlled areas, no antigovernment demonstrations were held throughout
 the year, and individuals who publicly voiced opposition views were regularly jailed.
 c. Freedom of Relmgion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of conscience and
 religion and free public profession of religious and other convictions, and the Gov-
 ernment respects these rights in practice. There is no state religion. All religious
 communities are free to conduct public services and to open and run social and char-
 itable institutions. Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodox Christianity, and Islam
 are the major faiths in Croatia, and there is also an active Jewish community. The
 majority of practicing Croats are Roman Catholic, and the Government provides op-
 tional Catholic religious education in schools.
 There are no formal restrictions on religious groups. The main mosque in Croatia
 is in Zagreb, where it serves not only as a religious center but also as a social aid
 office for the large Bosnian Muslim refugee population. Croatian Protestants from
 a number of denominations, as well as foreign clergy, actively practice and pros-
 elytize, as do representatives of eastern-based religions. Some foreigu religious orga-
 nizations seeking to provide social services reported bureaucratic obstacles to their
 
 
 827
 establishment in Croatia, but it was unclear if this had any connection with their
 rei gious character.
 The close identification of religion with ethnicity had earlier caused religious insti-
 tutions to be targets of violence. The Serbian Orthodox cathedral in downtown Za-
 greb is open, and several other Orthodox churches and monasteries operate freely
 in government-controlled Croatia. International human rights monitors said that
 the few Orthodox priests and nuns who remained in Croatia after the 1991 war re-
 ported generally good relations with their Catholic neighbors. After the military
 offensives in Western Slavonia and the Krajina region, military and police forces
 guarded most of the Orthodox churches to prevent them from being looted or de-
 stroyed. Nonetheless, some were reported to be looted or damaged.
 Most Catholic churches in the Serb-occupied areas have been destroyed. In East-
 ern Slavonia, only one active Croatian Catholic priest remains. A Slovak Catholic
 priest travels regularly from Serbia to hold masses.
 The Government discriminates against Muslims in the issuance of citizenship pa-
 pers. The Interior Ministry uses Article 26 of the Law on Citizenship to deny citi-
 zenship papers to persons otherwise qualified to be citizens of Croatia (see Section
 5).
 Most requests for conscientious objector exemption from military service were
 granted. There is no provision for conscientious objector status in the Serb-occupied
 areas.
 d. Freedom of Movernent Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution generally provides for these rights, with certain re-
 strictions. All persons legally in the country must register their residence with the
 local authorities. Under exceptional circumstances, the Government may legally re-
 strict the right to enter or leave the country if necessary to protect the "legal order,
 health, rights, or freedoms of others."
 The Government refused to allow the almost 200,000 refugees who fled the fight-
 ing to return to their homes in the former sectors north, south, and west. Between
 10,000 and 15,000 Serbs filed applications to return based on humanitarian consid-
 erations, but only 400 were approved by mid-November. Approval was granted only
 if the individual had- immediate family in Croatia who would sponsor his return and
 could prove legal residence in Croatia before independence. Approved returnees did
 not return to their homes in the former occupied areas, but were housed by their
 family sponsor.
 There are restrictions on freedom of movement for all journalists and all male citi-
 zens age 18 through 55 in the cities and in areas close to the confrontation lines.
 Journalists, as well as almost all others, must request permission to enter the con-
 flict zones.
 The Government imposed no significant legal restrictions on the movement of ref-
 ugees, displaced persons, or national minorities resident in Croatia. Many refugees
 were housed in remote locations with little or no means of public transport. There
 were several confn-med cases of forced return of refugees to Bosnia-Herzegovina, es-
 pecially from among the rebel Muslim refugees from the Bihac canton of Bosnia-
 Herzegovina. The Government tried to enforce strictly a policy of admitting no new
 refugee unless transit to a third country was assured. However, in idsummer
 large numbers of Croat and Muslim refugees, forced from Serb-held northern Bosnia
 by ethnic cleansing campaigns, entered Croatia via a crossing over the Sava river
 at Davor. Ethnic (Jroats were registered as refugees, as well as a few Muslims, but
 mast Muslim refugees were immediately repatriated to government-controlled areas
 of western Bosnia.
 The Government also continued to relocate refugees from coastal tourist facilities
 to inland areas and to recovered territories. Often this policy met resistance from
 refugee groups who did not want to move to buildings with few modern living facii-
 ties or to be uprooted and separated from the people with whom they had spent the
 last 4 years.
 The forces of Bosnian Muslim rebel leader Fikret Abdic were defeated by the
 Bosnan army in September, and over 20,000 people left the municipality of Velka
 Kladusa in northern Bosnia and entered Croatia. The Government refused to pro-
 vide hardened shelter and the refugees set up a make-shift camp in the village of
 Kupljensko. Although UNHCR and the international community determined them
 to be legitimate refugees from Bosnia, the Government refused to grant them this
 status and sought ways to repatriate them. Severe weather conditions and the lack
 of proper shelter combined to force many of the refugees to return to Bosnia on their
 own at the end of the year.
 The authorities in Serb-controlled areas continued to enforce a coercive regime,
 including curfews and strict travel limitations near the front lines. Threats against
 the nonrbs in protected villages effectively confined them to their homes. Serbs
 
 
 who crossed over from government-controlled Croatia were eagerly welcomed for
 propaganda purposes.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change their Govern-
 Croatia is a multiparty democracy in which all citizens 18 years of age and older
 have the right to vote by secret ballot. The President, elected for 5 years, exercises
 substantial power, authority, and influence but is constitutionally limited to two
 terms. Parliament is comprised of the House of Representatives and the House of
 Zupanije or Counties, and the Croatian democratic union (HDZ) holds a majority in
 both houses. Its leader, President Franjo Tudiman, was reelected in 1992.
 In elections for the House of Representatives, held in October, the HDZ again won
 a majority of the seats, and 11 other parties also won seats. International observers
 faulted the election campaign on a number of points: the electoral law was hastily
 presented to Parliament and passed after only a few hours of debate; a special fran-
 chise for Croats living permanently outside the country was created to include al-
 most 10 percent of the seats in Parliament; ethnic Serb representation-based on
 percentage of population-was dropped from 13 seats to 3 without a census; changes
 in constituency boundaries appeared to be arbitrary and non-transparent; the state-
 run media restricted criticism of government policies and activities; and the election
 administration was flawed (voter lists were often inaccurate and outdated). The
 franchise for the diaspora included ethnic Croats born and resident in Bosnia-
 Herzegovina, but excluded ethnic Serbs bern in Croatia, who were living as refugees
 in Serb-controlled areas. Rules for access to the state-owned media restricted the
 ability of oppition parties to criticize government policies and activities.
 During the election, established polling procedures were generally observed. Poll
 workers and officials demonstrated a genuine commitment to conducting their work
 freely and fa and and usuly y welcomed the presence of foreign observers. There
 were, however, inconsistencies among polling places, most of which probably re-
 suIted from a lack of training for election officials. Problems during voting appear
 to have curtailed the rights of sme minority voters. For example, there were re-
 ports that some Serbs were not allowed to vote for the state-wide party list if they
 exercised their right to vote on the special list for ethnic Serb candidates as allowed
 under the law. Cases of passive intimidation of Serb voters were also reported by
 election observers. Representatives of most minority groups (including Serbs) com-
 plained that voters had been left off the rolls or had been misclassified as Croats,
 an error which applied to an estimated 10 percent of minority voters in some areas,
 according to a number of election obsveres.
 In September the Government temporarily rescinded Articles 21 and 22 (and all
 other relevant articles) of the 1992 Constitutional Law on Human Rights and Free-
 dom. These laws had established self-governing special status districts in areas
 where minorities made up more than 50 percent of the population, namely, mu   ci-
 palities in the Knin an   oGina regions. The provisions remain suspended indefi-
 nitely, and at a minimum until the results of an April 1996 census are known. This
 repeal of the special districts law, officially justified by the change in the demo-
 graphics of the territory, as well as the law confiscating abandoned property, and
 the refusal to allow the mass return of Serb refugees, contributed to charges that
 the Government sought to legalize and institutionalize the population changes after
 the offensives to create a homogeneous country with no significant minorities.
 Although there are no legal restrictions on participation by women or minorities
 in the political process, they are represented in only small numbers in Parliament,
 the executive branch, and courts. Fifteen women hold seats in the 206-member Par-
 liament; one is the President of the House of Counties. Election law requires rep-
 resentation for minorities in Parliament, with proportional representation for any
 minority that makes up more than 8 percent of the population. Parliament's October
 reduction in the number of Serbian representatives was based on estimates of the
 number of Serbs who fled Croatia and the assumption that they would not return,
 disregarding the fact that they remained Croatian citizens. Two of the three remain-
 ing seats were won by the Serbian People's Party and one seat went to the Social
 Democratic Action Party.
 The "RSK" held elections in December 1993 which no international body recog-
 nized as either legitimate or fair. The "presidential" candidate sponsored by Bel-
 grade, Milan Martic, 'won" only after official manipulation of the vote. After the fall
 of the "RSK," the long-serving leaders of Eastern Slavonia appointed themselves as
 the "regional governing council" and "politically" reorganized themselves as a "dis-
 trict, " no longer a "republic." No minorities were represented in either the "par-
 liament" or the "government" of the "RSK," nor are any on the council.
 
 
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights groups in Zagreb, Split, Rijeka, and Osijek worked to prevent
 human rights abuses in their respective localities and brought their concerns to the
 attention of local and national authorities as well as domestic and international
 media. Most of these groups focused on legal advocacy programs and social services
 support for the remaining populations in the recovered territories. A coalition of
 ro ups was created in May to support and monitor the human rights situation in
 Western Slavonia. Elements of this coalition were later extended to Knin. Human
 rights groups remained highly critical of the Government's human rights record.
 Major local human rights groups include the Croatian Helsinki Commission, the
 Antiwar Campaign, the Dalmatian Solidarity Committee, the Dalmatian Committee
 for Human Rights, and the Center for Peace and Human Rights. The Serbian Peo-
 ples' Party and the Social Democratic Union have human rights committees. The
 Serbian Democratic Forum, another local human rights group, focused primarily on
 the concerns of the Serbian community. All of these groups have publicly criticized
 the Government's human rights policy. International human rights organizations
 are also active in Croatia.
 The Government cooperated with international investigations of war crimes car-
 ried out by the U.N. Commission of Experts, permitting Tree access to refugees for
 gathering eyewitness testimony, even in cases in which Croats were the likely per-
 petrators of the witnessed atrocities. The Government pledged its cooperation with
 the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of War Crimes in the Former Yugo-
 slavia in the Hague. However, in November President Tudjman named the com-
 mander of Bosnian Croat forces, Major General Tihomir Blaskic, to a new post in
 the Inspector General Directorate of the 1W, a day after Blaskic had been indicted
 by the tribunal. This appointment raised questions about the Government's pledge.
 Serbian forces did not permit the formation or functioning of local human rights
 groups and impeded the work of international human rights groups. An organiza-
 tion called the Danube Peace Bridge, based in southern Hungary, was active in
 Eastern Slavonia, supported by activists from both Croatia and Serbia. However,
 local "officials" prevented Croatian human rights monitors from government-con-
 trolled Croatia from entering the region. Only U.N. personnel and the European
 Union Monitoring Mission have limited freedom to observe human rights practices
 in these areas.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution specifies that all citizens shall enjoy all rights and freedoms, re-
 gardless of race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or
 social origin, property, birth, education, social status, or other attributes. It adds
 that members of al nations and minorities shall have equal rights in Croatia. With
 the exceptions noted below, these rights are observed in practice. One article pro-
 vides for special 'wartime measures- but states that restrictions shall be appro-
 priate to the nature of the danger and may not result in the inequality of citizenship
 with respect to race, color, sex, language, religion, or national or social origin. Under
 these measures, these rights have been observed in practice.
 Women.-Although the Government does not collect statistics, informed observers
 state that violence against women, including s usal abuse, is common and that the
 number of incidents has increased in the last few years. Alcohol abuse is commonly
 cited as a contributing factor. Centers for the psychological and medical care of
 abused women are open in several cities, and there is a 24-hour hot line in a Zagreb
 medical center. A number of local institutions and voluntary agencies offer social,
 medical, and other assistance to abused women and to those traumatized by war
 experiences. Family crisis associations are also active.
 The law does not discriminate by gender. In practice, however, women generally
 hold lower paying positions in the work force. Although no statistics are available,
 the majority of high school and elementary teachers, nurses, and clerical workers
 are believed to be female. Although the number of female-led organizations has in-
 creased since the war, most are devoted to antiwar or humanitarian causes and are
 poorly organized and poorly funded. There is no national organization of women de-
 voted to the protection of women's rights.
 Children.-The Government strongly committed to the welfare of children. Edu-
 cation is compulsory up to age 14. Schools provide free meals for children, day nurs-
 eries are available in most communities even for infants, and medical care for chil-
 dren is free.
 There is no documented pattern of societal abuse or discrimination against chil-
 dren.
 
 
 830
 People With Disabilities.-There is no specific legislation mandating access to
 buildings or government services for people vith disabilities; access to such facilities
 is often difficult. The Government began a new progam to provide several disabled
 war veterans with publicly financed homes designeclespecially to accommodate their
 particular disability. People with disabilities face no discriminatory measures, and
 education and job opportunities generally are available.
 Religious Minorities.-The Muslim community in Croatia suffered from discrimi-
 nation, and Croatian Muslims and Bosnian refugees continue to report widespread
 discrimination in many areas such as citizenship (see Section 2.c.) and employment
 rights. The U.N. Special Rapporteur on Human Rights noted that Muslims (along
 with Serbs) "are always the first to be dismissed" from jobs (see Section 5).
 National/RaciallEthnic Minorities.-Constitutionally, Croatian Serbs and other
 minority groups enjoy the same protection as other self-identified ethnic and reli-
 gious groups in the country. In practice, however, there continues to be ever-
 present, subtle, and sometimes open discrimination against Orthodox Serbs in such
 areas as the administration of justice, employment, housing, and the free exercise
 of cultural rights. Serbs continue to be particularly vulnerable to attack because of
 the Government's reluctance rigorously to protect their rights. Attacks against prop-
 erty owned by Serbs, or even Croats with Serb-sounding names, continued, although
 at a lesser rate than in previous years. Serbs in Croatia also continued to receive
 anonymous threats by mail, telephone, and facsimile, but in fewer numbers than in
 previous years. Many Serbs left government-controlled Croatia during the year as
 a result of the combination of economic discrimination and physical threats and the
 lack of interest shown by the Government in devising measures to restore con-
 fidence among Serbs remaining in the formerly occupied areas.
 The makeup of the police force, which consists almost exclusively of ethnic
 Croats--some with little experience or training in police work--contributed to the
 problem. As in previous years, the vast majority of cases of societal violence against
 Serbs went unpunished. The Government's practice of discriminating against ethnic
 and religious minorities, particularly Serbs and Muslims, in the issuance of citizen-
 ship papers, drew harsh criticism. Human rights groups report numerous docu-
 mented cases in which the Interior Ministry denied citizenship papers to long-term
 residents of Croatia (that is, resident in Croatia long before the country declared
 its independene). Human rights grups complain that the Interior Ministry almost
 always based its denials on Artice 26 of the Law on Citizenship, which permits it
 to deny citizenship papers to persons otherwise qualified to be citizens of Croatia
 for reasons of national interest. The law does not require the reasons to be ex-
 plained, and human rights organizations reported that the police continued to refuse
 citizenship applications without fill explanation._
 The law on citizenship distingruishes between those with a claim to Croatian eth-
 nicity and those without. The 'Croatinn people" are eligible to become citizens of
 Croatia even if they did not have previous citizenship of the former Socialist Repub-
 lic of Croatia, as long as they submit a written statement that they consider them-
 selves Croatian citizens. Others must satisfy more stringent requirements through
 naturalization in order to obtain citizenship, even if they were previously lawfl
 residents of Croatia as citizens of the former Yugoslavia. While an application for
 citizenship is pending, the applicant is considered an alien and is denied rights such
 as social allowances, including medical care, pensions, free education, and employ-
 ment in the civil service.
 Serbs and other ethnic minorities also suffered from economic discrimination. The
 U.N. Special Rapporteur on Human Rights previously noted in his report that "it
 appears that Serbs and Muslims are always the first to be dismissed." While the
 difficult economic situation continued to cause high unemployment for all sectors of
 society, the Special Rapporteur's concern was amplified by a large number of credi-
 ble reports that Serbs bore a disproportionate burden in layoffs by a broad variety
 of employers. Throughout the year, human rights organizations continued to receive
 inquiries from Serbs who had been fired from their jobs as far back as 1992. While
 in many cases it was impossible to determine the proximate cause for the firing of
 an employee, there were cases where the employee's ethnicity was the stated reason.
 In one case, the only doctor to remain in the Knin hospital following "Operation
 Storm" was dismissed. In some cases, despite court orders which confirmed the em-
 ployee's right to employment or reinstatement to a previous position, the employer
 still refused to rehire workers who had been out of work since 1992.
 Roma continued to face societal discrimination and official inaction when com-
 plaints were filed. The 1991 census shows a total of under 7,000 Roma in the coun-
 try but community leaders number the group in the tens of thousands.
 Other minority groups--Slovaks, Czechs, Italians, Hungarians-did not report sig-
 nificant discrimination to the same extent as the Serb community. At the start of
 
 
 the autumn school year, ethnic Hungarian parents complained that only children
 whose parents were both registered to be of Hungarian ethnicity could register in
 Hungarian schools, preventing many children of mixed background from attending.
 The Italian minority in Istria and other ethnic communities alleged disproportionate
 numbers of mobilizations prior to both military offensives, as a test of their loyalty
 to Croatia.
 In general, non-Serb minorities in the Serb-occupied areas were treated in abys-
 mal fashion. Most had already been "ethnically cleansed", but those Croats, Hungar-
 ians and other remaining non-Serbs were subject to summary detention, harass-
 ment, and physical intimidation.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers, except military and police personnel,
 are entitled to form or join unions of their own choosing without prior authorization.
 There is an active labor movement with three national labor federations and inde-
 pendent associations of both blue-collar and white-collar members. In general,
 unions are independent of the Government and political parties.
 The right to strike is provided for in the Constitution and is limited only for the
 armed forces, police, government administration, and public services. Strikes have
 been infrequent since the end of 1994, with two notable exceptions in the transpor-
 tation sector. Railway workers went on strike in December 1994 to protest poor
 safety conditions and late payment of wages. Airline pilots went on strike for a few
 days in the fall due to a wage dispute. Although there was relatively little labor un-
 rest, workers continue to complain about the inability of government-owned or gov-
 ernment-run institutions or industries to pay wages on time. For example, teachers
 who struck at the beginning of the 1994-95 academic year continued to protest gov-
 ernment wage policy and on more than one occasion threatened to resume strike
 activity. Despite strikes and prtests, the Government hewed closely to the austerity
 program it implemented in October 1993 as part of its economic stabilization pro-
 gram. The railway strike, however, succeeded in gaining greater union representa-
 tion within management.
 Unions may freely affiliate internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.--Colective bargaining is pro-
 tected by law and practiced freely. In the spring, Parliament passed a new Labor
 Code, with union support, which revised the statutes governing collective bargaining
 contracts, protection for striking workers, and legal limitations on the ability of em-
 ployers to conduct "lockouts during labor disputes. Many enterprises which were
 "socially owned" have been "transformed" or nationalized as a first step towards pri-
 vatization. In the current transition to privatization and a free market economy
 unions are under pressure due to job losses, general unemployment in a weakened
 economy, and their own struggle to become genuine free trade unions.
 The new Labor Code deals directly with antiunion discrimination issues. It allows
 unions to challenge firings in court, and eliminates provisions under which illness
 had been a valid reason for employers to fire workers. It also erases provisions
 which, under the old code, required union shop stewards to remain on the job while
 serving full time on workers' councils, and grants them the right of reinstatement
 when service is completed. Nevertheless, the trade union federations have alleged
 that the Government employs strong-arm tactics against employees involved in
 labor disputes and strikes to force them back to work. Some threats are alleged to
 include mobilization, or "work obligations," whereby outside workers are dated to
 fill positions.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory work is con-
 stitutionally forbidden, and there were no documented instances of it. The Ministry
 of Labor and Social Welfare is the agency charged with enforcing the ban on coerced
 or forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for youth em-
 ployment is 15, and it is enforced by the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare.
 Under the Constitution, children may not be employed before reaching the legally
 determined age, nor may they be forced or allowed to do work that is harmful to
 their health or morality. Workers under age 18 are entitled to special protection at
 work and are prohibited from heavy manual labor. Education is mandatory up to
 age 14.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There are national minimum wage standards.
 Public service unions are pacesetters for the rest of the work force, and they were
 in the forefront of continued efforts to encourage the Government to honor its com-
 mitments. As of October, the minimum gross monthly wage was roughly $200 (1024
 kuna). National regulations provide for a 42-hour workweek, overtime pay, a half-
 
 
 832
 hour daily break, and a minimum of 18 days of paid vacation annually. It is stand-
 ard practice to provide a 24-hour rest period during the workweek.
 Health and safety standards are set by the Government and are enforced by the
 Ministry of Health. In practice, industries are not diligent in meeting standards for
 worker protection.
