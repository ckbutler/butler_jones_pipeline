 ZAMBIA
 Zambia is a one-party state in which individual rights, basic
 freedoms, and due process are generally well observed while
 some political rights are restricted. Much of the
 decisionmaking power is concentrated in the hands of the
 President, Kenneth Kaunda, who, unopposed, was reelected in
 1983 to his fifth consecutive five-year term. He is advised
 by a central committee of party leaders and governs through a
 Cabinet and a Parliament elected through controlled
 elections. The President possesses sweeping powers--conferred
 on him by emergency legislation which dates from 1964--to
 suspend observance of legal rights in the "interest of state
 security." The Constitution also allows the National Assembly
 to suspend basic constitutional guarantees. Candidates for
 political office at any level must be members of the United
 National Independence Party (UNIP).
 Zambia's economy continues to be severely depressed due to
 such factors as low prices for the country's mineral exports,
 the high cost of basic imports, inadequate agricultural
 production, and statist policies. Also, the rapid rate of
 population growth is outstripping increases in productivity.
 There has been a continuing decline in the standard of living,
 but the Government is taking steps to improve the management
 of the economy and to encourage the private sector, including
 removing agricultural production disincentives, while
 attempting to maintain delivery of a wide range of social
 services to the citizenry. Urban crime and smuggling are
 widespread and growing, severely taxing the limited
 capabilities of Zambia's police and military forces.
 In January 1983, Zambia's high court convicted seven persons
 of conspiring to overthrow the Government and handed down
 mandatory death sentences. The convictions were appealed to
 the Supreme Court, which took testimony in open session during
 August and September 1984. On April 2, 1985, the Supreme
 Court reversed the convictions of two men sentenced to death
 and dismissed the appeals of the other five. The five men
 facing death sentences have the right to appeal to President
 Kaunda for clemency. During 1985, over 40 persons were
 detained under orders signed by the President.
 There was no major change in the status of human rights in
 Zambia in 1985. Zambian institutions such as the press, trade
 unions, and churches have come under some pressure from
 central authorities to be more responsive to the wishes of the
 Government but have maintained to the best of their ability
 their objectivity, status, and influence. There is strong
 competition for parliamentary seats within the single-party
 structure. The National Assembly provides a platform for the
 spirited consideration of issues. The judiciary is
 independent and takes full account of the rights of the
 accused. The trade union movement continues to be one of the
 best organized and most democratic in Africa, and the churches
 remain a strong independent force which can unite to defend
 common interests. Zambia continues to serve as a place of
 first asylum for refugees in the region.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 During 1985, there were no killings for which there was
 evidence of political motivation or government instigation.
 b. Disappearance
 No case of politically motivated disappearance is known to
 have occurred during 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture, but there are allegations
 that police and military personnel have used cruel treatment
 when arresting persons and have resorted to torture when
 interrogating detainees. Charges of torture and mistreatment
 are reported freely in the press when victims register their
 complaints in court. The courts frequently order
 investigations to ascertain if confessions or statements were
 made after torture or physical or mental mistreatment and have
 consistently rejected statements obtained under duress from
 arrested persons. Abuses of prisoners are reported to include
 beatings, pain inflicted on various parts of the body, and
 long periods of solitary confinement. Prisoners have
 successfully sued the state for damages as a result of prison
 abuses. The Director of Public Prosecutions has announced
 that he would meet with the Inspector General of police
 concerning complaints from prisoners of beatings while in
 police custody.
 Zambian prisons are overcrowded, understaffed, and
 unsanitary. In the past 20 years, the prison population has
 grown from 5,000 to 11,000 with no corresponding growth in
 facilities. Medical facilities are meager, but prisoners with
 serious medical problems are treated in public hospitals.
 Prisoners are generally segregated by sex, seriousness of the
 offense, and age group. There is no institutional
 differentiation in the treatment of different categories of
 prisoners charged or convicted under civil or criminal
 statutes, but Presidential detainees receive better care than
 that accorded common criminals.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the state of emergency, which has been in effect since
 independence in 1964, the President has broad discretion to
 detain or restrict the movements of individuals. Detention
 procedures have been revised to conform with the provisions of
 the Constitution and have increased the President's authority.
 The President can order a detainee to be incarcerated
 indefinitely and is not legally bound to accept a court's
 acquittal if he still believes that the detainee is guilty.
 In practice, however, detainees are almost always released if
 the court finds in their favor. By law, presidential
 detainees are entitled to: formal notification within 14 days
 of the reasons for their detention; publication of their
 detention in the government gazette; access to counsel;
 frequent visitation by family and colleagues; immediate
 representation to the detaining authority; and the right to
 
 
 383
 ZAMBIA
 seek judicial review of the detention order by an independent
 and impartial tribunal after 1 year. Presidential detainees
 have their cases heard by the high court and have the right to
 appeal to the Supreme Court. Habeas corpus is, in principle,
 available to persons detained under presidential order, but
 the Government is not obliged to accept the recommendation of
 the review tribunal. It is estimated that approximately 45
 presidential detainees are currently held in Zambia.
 During 1985, the presidential detention power was used to
 arrest about 40 persons, many of whom were allegedly involved
 in illegal drug or currency transactions. Ten of those
 detainees were released after being detained for periods
 ranging from a few days to 4 months. Most of the other
 detainees are seeking their release through court actions, but
 this can be a slow process which can take anywhere from a few
 months to several years. Detainees can sue the state for
 unlawful detention and false imprisonment, and such cases were
 brought to court during 1985.
 Under the state of emergency, law officers and defense
 personnel have extraordinary powers. Police officers of
 assistant inspector rank and above may arrest without a
 warrant and detain a person for up to 28 days if the officer
 has reason to believe grounds exist to justify a presidential
 detention order. However, within 14 days police must provide
 the detainee with the reasons for his detention or his
 incarceration is void. This requirement is followed
 rigorously. Security officers have broad powers to search
 suspects and their homes and sometimes act without warrants
 when looking for .smugglers or illegal aliens.
 There is no slavery, involuntary servitude, or forced labor in
 Zambia. These are prohibited by the Constitution.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Zambian judicial system consists of a Supreme Court with
 appellate powers and a series of lower courts--of which the
 high court is the most important. Presidential detainees are
 not automatically guaranteed public trials, but the majority
 have been tried in public. The safeguards of English common
 law are provided in court cases not involving presidential
 detainees. Independent observation confirms the independence
 of the Zambian judiciary from executive branch influence. The
 President's power to appoint and transfer judges has sometimes
 been cited as proof that judicial independence can be
 compromised. However, there is no evidence that such power
 has swayed court decisions.
 There are probably five or fewer detainees who could make a
 claim to political prisoner status, and even in these cases it
 is possible that the persons were involved either in acts of
 violence or in plotting actions involving violence. Three of
 these detainees are charged with involvement in the alleged
 1981 plot to rescue prisoners accused of treason, but they
 have not yet been brought to trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Zambian Government does not require membership in
 political organizations and usually does not monitor
 correspondence or telephones or otherwise interfere in family
 life. The sanctity of the home is generally respected, except
 
 
 384
 ZAMBIA
 in isolated incidents relating to the national emergency or to
 roundups of illegal aliens. In such cases, security forces
 often do not have search warrants.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is considerable freedom of press and speech in Zambia,
 and the press regularly reports criticism of government
 activities expressed by sources ranging from elected officials
 to average citizens. The two national dailies are owned by
 the Government and the party respectively, but substantial
 commentary critical of party and government performance is
 permitted. The Times of Zambia, the party paper, is generally
 independent of outside direction. The papers discuss economic
 policy, corruption, and poor administration. However,
 negative comments concerning the Head of State, the concept of
 the one-party state, or the national philosophy, "Humanism",
 are prohibited. Journalists and commentators know the limits
 of criticism and avoid reporting which could lead to charges
 of libel and slander. An independent biweekly paper, which is
 sometimes critical of official policies, is published by an
 association of churches, and two other independent papers
 focus on mining and financial subjects. Television and radio
 are owned and operated by the Government; frequent panel
 discussion programs provide for a wide range of views on
 Zambian issues.
 While the possibility of censorship of foreign publications
 and news items exists, it is seldom invoked. Academic freedom
 is highly respected in Zambian society, and Zambian educators
 are outspoken in their commitment to an educational system
 free of government influence. There is little or no
 governmental influence in matters relating to curriculum,
 student selection, or faculty assignment.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Police permits are required for meetings, rallies, or
 marches. These permits are issued routinely, unless the
 Government believes the proceedings are likely to be directed
 against local authorities. While there is a ban on all
 political activity outside the one-party structure, Zambia has
 a profusion of trade associations and professional groups
 which can serve as unofficial pressure groups on various
 economic, political, and social subjects.
 Zambia has a history of strong labor union organizations,
 dating from the establishment of large copper mines during the
 1930's. Zambia's 18 national labor unions, which are
 organized by industry or profession, are all members of the
 Zambia Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU). Member unions defend
 worker interests, especially regarding wages and conditions of
 work, and have the right to bargain collectively. Under
 existing legislation, strikes are permitted only for specific
 reasons and only after all other recourse has been exhausted.
 Virtually all strikes are illegal, since they almost always
 commence before the mandatory process of mediation has run its
 course. However, the Government has normally relied on
 persuasion and continued mediation to end strikes once they
 have begun. A series of wildcat strikes during 1985,
 involving workers in such important sectors as finance and
 mining, resulted in a government decree declaring workers in
 most sectors of the economy "essential" and therefore liable
 
 
 385
 ZAMBIA
 to prosecution for illegal strike action. However, the
 Government has yet to invoke this decree. The ZCTU is not
 controlled by the party or Government, and union leaders
 frequently criticize government policy on such subjects as
 wages, economic policy, conditions of service, and labor
 representation in party and government organs. The ZCTU is
 democratic and regularly conducts open elections to select its
 leadership. It is active in the International Labor
 Organization and is a member of the Organization of African
 Trade Union Unity.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed and has
 been supported by President Kaunda. Zambia has no state
 religion, and adherence to a particular faith does not confer
 either advantage or disadvantage. Christian missionaries from
 a wide variety of faiths operate freely in the country. While
 Jehovah's Witnesses are prohibited from proselytizing, the
 sect functions openly and its freedom not to participate in
 various secular activities such as voting, singing the
 national anthem, and saluting the flag has been upheld in the
 courts and supported by senior party leaders. Lay
 associations and religious youth groups operate independently
 of party control or influence.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The President may, under the emergency legislation, restrict
 the movement of individuals within Zambia, although this
 authority is seldom if ever used. The Government also
 reserves the right to refyse to issue or to withdraw passports
 to prevent foreign travel ')y individuals whose activities are
 considered inimical to Zambian interests. Such restrictions
 are occasionally applied. Strict currency regulations also
 serve to inhibit foreign travel or emigration.
 Acquisition, loss, or revocation of citizenship is governed by
 constitutional provisions and laws administered by the
 citizenship board. However, the President also has power to
 grant or revoke citizenship on an extraordinary basis.
 Zambia has long played host to a considerable refugee and
 asylum-seeking population that originates in several
 strife-torn southern African countries. The United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that there
 are about 97,000 refugees in Zambia. The largest group of
 refugees is from Angola, with significant numbers from Zaire,
 Namibia, and South Africa. Smaller numbers are from Malawi,
 Mozambique, and Zimbabwe. Many of the Angolans and Zaireans
 have spontaneously resettled in western and northwestern
 provinces since the ethnic compositions on both sides of the
 border are similar. The Zambian Government operates two large
 refugee resettlement centers, and the Southwest African
 People's Organization operates one camp. Urban refugees
 number approximately 700.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Since 1973, the United National Independence Party, with an
 estimated membership of less than 10 percent of the adult
 population, has been Zambia's sole legal political party.
 Power is concentrated in the hands of the President as leader
 
 
 386
 ZAMBIA
 of the party and Chief of State. He plays a dominant role in
 determining the membership of Zambia's top executive
 institutions, the party central committee and cabinet,
 although traditionally both bodies contain a general balance
 of regional and tribal representation.
 Candidates for political office at any level must be members
 of the party and are subject to close examination for
 suitability by senior party authorities. In practice, the
 Zambia political system is open to individuals of somewhat
 divergent opinions provided they are willing to work within
 the one-party structure and not challenge the President's
 preeminent position. In the latest parliamentary elections in
 1983, 760 candidates contested 125 seats; 40 incumbents were
 defeated, including 7 ministers of state.
 The National Assembly is reflective of constituent interests
 and sometimes thwarts or modifies executive branch policies
 and programs. It can also be very critical of such policies,
 as was demonstrated a number of times in 1985 when members of
 Parliament railed against government expenditures, poor
 services, and land allocations. Presidential and general
 elections are by universal suffrage but the numbering of
 ballots, which could be cross-checked against voter
 registration numbers, could undermine the secrecy of the
 ballot. In the 1983 presidential election, voters had the
 option of voting for or against the single candidate or
 abstaining. A total of 63.4 percent of registered voters went
 to the polls, of whom 93 percent voted in favor of the
 President.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 While there is no public record of the Zambian Government
 having been subject to such investigations during 1985, the
 Government neither encourages nor hinders inquiries or visits
 by human rights organizations. In its 1985 Report, Amnesty
 International was concerned about the detention without trial
 of alleged opponents of the Government. Freedom House rates
 Zambia "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Zambia continues to suffer from a prolonged economic
 recession, marked by inflation, serious unemployment, and
 scarce financial resources. The application of various
 economic policies since independence along socialist or
 centrally managed lines has not lived up to expectations.
 Real per capita income has fallen below the level at
 independence, and due to depressed prices for Zambia's copper
 exports, even total real national income remains below the
 level reached in 1977. Per capita gross national product fell
 from $644 in 1982 to $580 in 1983. Zambia's 6.8 million
 population is now growing at the rate of 3.2 percent (2.8
 percent in 1970). A 3-year drought during the period 1982-84
 reduced food production and forced further reliance on food
 imports. However, improved rainfall during early 1985 should
 provide Zambia with a better maize harvest.
 In the past three years, the Government has taken a number of
 measures designed to deal with the country's economic plight.
 It has restricted public spending, reduced or eliminated
 government subsidies on essential commodities, raised prices
 
 
 387
 ZAMBIA
 paid for agricultural produce, and devalued the currency by
 introducing an auction system for the purchase of foreign
 exchange. It is also taking steps to promote private
 initiative. The economy, however, faces a substantial debt
 burden and a return to economic growth is not expected for
 several years.
 The average income of rural inhabitants is estimated to be
 substantially less than one-third the size of the average
 earnings of urban dwellers. This imbalance has generated
 heavy rural-to-urban migration (over 40 percent of the
 population is urban), exacerbating already high unemployment
 and crime rates in urban areas. Nationwide, unemployment is
 well over a third of the potential work force. The top 20
 percent of households claims over 56 percent of the total
 income, while the bottom 40 percent gets 11 percent (1976).
 In addition, the gap between rural and urban areas in terms of
 education, housing, nutrition, and the availability of public
 services is considerable. However, by 1980 about the same
 percentage of rural dwellers (66.4 percent) had access to safe
 water as urban dwellers (67 percent). Life expectancy at
 birth is 51.7 years. The infant mortality rate is 107 per
 1,000 live births (1985). The fertility rate is 6.1 live
 births per woman, one of the highest in the world.
 The literacy rate is estimated at 54 percent. According to
 1980 statistics on school enrollment as a ratio of population
 in age groups, almost all Zambia's primary-age children are
 enrolled in primary school. Less than 20 percent of primary
 school graduates are admitted to secondary school due to
 limitations of facilities and resources. Female students can
 be admitted to secondary school with lower passing marks than
 male students as part of Zambia's "affirmative action" program.
 Zambian law regulates minimum health and safety standards and
 worker rights in any industrial undertaking. Boards appointed
 by the Government and including worker and employer
 representatives fix minimum wages, overtime pay, and
 conditions of employment. Women are excluded from night work
 and a variety of hazardous occupations. Although age
 restrictions apply to the industrial sector, with few cases of
 employees under age 16, in the commercial and agricultural
 sectors persons under age 14 are often employed.
 Under statutory law, women generally enjoy full equality with
 men, and women participate increasingly in Zambia's social,
 economic, and political life. They hold some senior positions
 in the party, the Government, and the judiciary, and are
 gaining increasing representation in the professions and
 higher education. In 1983, the number of women on the party's
 25-member central committee was increased from 2 to 4.
 Nevertheless, the majority of Zambian women still occupy
 traditional roles. Customary law and practice still compete
 on a de facto basis in most rural areas with Zambia's
 Constitution and codified laws. Some customary statutes place
 women in subordinate or unequal status with respect to
 property inheritances and marriage. The Law Development
 Commission is seeking ways to remove such anomalies. In
 Zambia's traditional society, women's primary role is bearing
 and raising children.
