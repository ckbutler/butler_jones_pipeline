 BRAZIL
 Brazil returned to democratic rule in 1985, after 21 years of
 military-dominated governments. Jose Sarney, chosen as Vice
 President by the electoral college in January 1985, became
 President 4 months later following the death of the
 President-elect.
 A new Congress was freely elected in November 1986, with the
 participation of 30 political parties. The previous Congress
 played an active role in national policymaking, and the new
 Congress is expected to enlarge that role. Congress will sit
 as a Constitutional Assembly in 1987 with sole authority to
 draft and implement a new constitution replacing that imposed
 during the military regime. The Brazilian judiciary is a
 respected and independent institution and is largely
 successful in ensuring that citizens are accorded protections
 of the law.
 Internal security is provided by various branches of the
 Brazilian military and by federal, state, and local police
 forces, although the role of the Armed Forces has been
 downgraded since the end of military government.
 In 1986 economic growth was expected to approach the high 8
 percent rate of 1985. Brazil has the eighth largest economy
 in the non-Communist world, but it has had to cope with
 foreign debt of over 100 billion dollars and high inflation.
 In February the Government implemented a major economic reform
 package which de-indexed the economy and froze salaries and
 prices. The Government has been able to adjust the economy's
 external sector to current international financial conditions,
 maintaining a continued large trade surplus.
 While political rights were considerably improved by the
 transition to civilian government in 1985, problems remained
 in other human rights areas in 1986, notably in the treatment
 of common criminals and Indians. Brazilians are free to
 participate in the political and economic life of the
 country. The President may, however, invoke constitutionally
 sanctioned emergency powers and has authority to issue
 decree-laws. Although a decree-law enters into effect
 immediately, it must then be submitted to Congress, which has
 60 days to approve or reject it. President Sarney has used
 decree-laws to implement major economic reforms.
 Under the current civil code, Brazilian Indians are considered
 "semi-competent" wards of the State and live under certain
 restrictions and protections not applicable to other
 citizens. Indians on a number of reservations are under
 pressure from mineral and agricultural developers and
 squatters to open more of their lands to others.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no instances of politically motivated killings by
 government authorities. However, criminal investigation into
 the 1984 murder of a journalist opposed to the Governor of
 Paraiba state disclosed evidence in 1986 indicating that state
 authorities may have ordered the crime and then used police
 resources to cover up their involvement. Human rights
 
 
 BRAZIL
 organizations in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo regularly charge
 that police have killed individuals suspected of common
 crimes. Human rights activists also believe that many of the
 more than 200 criminals reported killed annually in
 confrontations with Sao Paulo police have been killed after
 capture. While such killings apparently continued in 1986,
 they are not politically motivated. Catholic Church sources,
 particularly the National Conference of Brazilian Bishops,
 believe insufficient resources have been devoted by local or
 state governments to combat the problem.   The situation has
 been complicated by an alarming rise in the rate of violent
 crime in Rio and Sao Paulo, which has led to a high degree of
 public tolerance of alleged police brutality toward suspects.
 Conflicts between rural landowners and the landless also
 resulted in more than 200 killings in 1986, including the
 murder of a priest who had been active in organizing
 squatters. Rural labor union organizers were targets in
 numerous areas. Authorities have condemned the violence, but
 measures taken to control it have been ineffective.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated abductions.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by the penal code, and there were no
 reports of politically motivated torture occurring in 1986.
 However, various human rights and professional organizations
 report that police beatings and torture of persons suspected
 of common crimes are widespread, the principal purpose
 appparently being to extract confessions. Such practices
 primarily affect the underprivileged.
 Although Church authorities in Rio noted a steady decline in
 these offenses in 1983-84, due to government efforts to curb
 mistreatment of suspects, there was no evidence of further
 significant improvement during 1985 or 1986. In Sao Paulo and
 the rest of the country police brutality toward suspected
 criminals remains widespread. Human rights activists in most
 Brazilian cities maintain that these abuses continue because
 of the perception by police that they can act with impunity.
 Little improvement was noted in 1986, even though in some
 instances police officers, including high-ranking officials,
 have been investigated and brought to trial. In one of the
 most publicized cases, a group of police officers accused of
 torture was found innocent by the courts in Porto Alegre. The
 prisoner allegedly tortured was later killed by unknown
 assailants after his release.
 Most prison facilities continue to be overcrowded, and many
 are poorly maintained and managed. The State of Sao Paulo is
 now engaged in a major construction program of medium-security
 regional prisons. There has been no such investment in Rio or
 most other states. The federal Ministry of Justice was
 unable to supply funds for new prison construction during
 1986. Conditions in Minas Gerais improved slightly, with no
 new reports of the "death lotteries," in which prisoners are
 killed by fellow inmates, supposedly to focus public attention
 on overcrowded prison conditions; such lotteries claimed the
 lives of 20 prisoners in 1985.
 Prison riots during 1986 reflected both inmate revolt against
 poor conditions and slow processing of criminal cases, as well
 
 
 418
 BRAZIL
 as lack of effective control by prison authorities. In three
 episodes hostages were taken by rebellious inmates. In a
 revolt in Sao Paulo in September, 12 inmates were beaten to
 death by police or prison guards when the police assaulted the
 prison. In two additional revolts in Brasilia and Mato Grosso
 do Sul, armed inmates were allowed to leave prisons with their
 hostages, and police then attempted to recapture the
 fugitives. Three fugitives were killed during capture
 attempts. No hostages were'injured.
 Human rights organizations encounter little public support for
 the rights of criminal offenders. Public criticism of the
 prison system is directed not at the subhuman conditions, but
 at the lack of construction to allow for incarceration of more
 criminals.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The independent judiciary is largely successful in ensuring
 that legal protections are afforded most citizens, although
 delivery of justice to economically deprived groups is
 incomplete. Under the law, a person may not be arbitrarily
 detained. Judicial determination of the legality of detention
 is guaranteed by the Constitution and is respected.
 The law provides for provisional detention when ordered by
 judges, in cases of common crimes, or by certain high-level
 administrative authorities in cases of crimes involving public
 administration or extradition. For example, a judge may order
 provisional detention to preserve public order when there is
 evidence of probable cause, when the accused is considered
 dangerous or does not have a fixed job or address, or when the
 individual is caught in the act of an unbailable crime.
 Detention may also be ordered to prevent interference by the
 accused in criminal proceedings, as for example when the
 individual might influence or harm witnesses. Provisional
 detention can be extended until the case comes to trial or
 until a judge rules that reasons for the detention no longer
 exist. Provisional detention in Brazil is not practiced
 arbitrarily and does not normally lead to periods of
 imprisonment in excess of 15 days.
 Forced or compulsory labor is not used in Brazil by any
 official or government organization. During 1986 federal
 authorities arrested labor contractors in several northeastern
 and Amazon states for maintaining "slave" work forces;
 employers deducted transportation and other expenses from
 salaries and prevented workers from leaving the property.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is guaranteed by law for both
 penal code and National Security Law violations and is
 respected in practice. Defendants are entitled to counsel and
 must be made fully aware of the charges against them. In
 cases where a defendant cannot afford an attorney, one must be
 provided free of charge. However, there are too few public
 defenders, and thousands of criminal cases are now
 backlogged. Defendants and their attorneys have the legal
 right to be informed of the evidence on which the charges are
 based. Only cases of willful crimes against life are tried by
 jury; all others are tried by a single judge.
 Lynchings by irate citizens of suspected criminals continued
 in 1986. The greatest incidence of lynching takes place in
 
 
 419
 BRAZIL
 the slums on the outskirts of major cities, a result of
 perceptions that police and court protection is unavailable.
 The judicial system is an independent branch of government.
 The federal court system is composed of courts of first
 instance and appeals courts. The federal Supreme Court is the
 highest court in Brazil. The states are free to organize
 their own judicial systems as long as they do not violate
 basic principles of the federal Constitution. Brazil also has
 a system of specialized courts dealing with labor, elections,
 and juvenile matters.
 The military court system hears cases involving military
 personnel and civilians charged under the National Security
 Law or with offenses against military installations. Legal
 guarantees also apply in military courts. Civilians have the
 right of appeal to the federal Supreme Court when convicted of
 crimes against the National Security Law. Military personnel
 may also appeal to the Supreme Court, but only in
 extraordinary circumstances. The Minister of Justice has
 stated that civilians will not be charged under the National
 Security Law pending its revision. No one is currently
 imprisoned under its provisions, nor has anyone been charged
 with violations since the civilian government took office.
 The two cases pending in 1985 for attempts to organize
 Communist parties were dropped. A state deputy was convicted
 in April-for statements made during the 1982 electoral
 campaign, but a military court reversed the decision. A labor
 union leader was convicted for statements made in 1983
 maligning the President under the military regime. He was
 given a 2-year suspended sentence.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 Forced entry into homes without a warrant probably still
 occurs in searches for criminals, but this practice has
 declined in recent years, according to human rights
 organizations. There are no reports of such illegal entries
 of homes in political cases. Freedom from search is
 constitutionally guaranteed.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The right to free speech and to a free press is guaranteed in
 the Constitution. Electronic media broadcasts covered a vast
 array of topics, including controversial social and political
 issues and opposition viewpoints were aired freely. The
 Government did not illegally interfere with the media.
 Radio and television stations are privately owned, but the
 Government can withdraw their licenses easily. A television
 station in Maranhao was suspended for 35 days for violating
 the federal broadcasting code which prohibits statements
 offending government authorities. The suspension was the
 culmination of a 3-year process of administrative warnings and
 fines for attacks against President Sarney and his family. No
 licenses were revoked, however, and the administration
 continued its review of all licenses issued during the last 6
 months of the previous government. Newspapers are also
 privately owned and are vigorous in reporting and commenting
 on government policies and performance. Self-censorship is
 rare.
 
 
 420
 BRAZIL
 Foreign publications are widely distributed in Brazil. A
 restrictive censorship law still exists but, with a small
 number of well-publicized exceptions, it is enforced only to
 protect young people from material deemed to be damaging to
 their character. A new law under consideration is expected to
 concentrate on protection of minors from harmful influences,
 including narcotics and pornography. Books and newspapers are
 not censored, and films, songs, and plays are no longer
 reviewed for political content. Prior review of films and
 television programing continues but is normally limited to
 rating for acceptable viewing age. Two films were censored in
 1986, both after initial approval by the federal Censorship
 Office. President Sarney acceded to Catholic Church requests
 to prohibit the controversial Jean-Luc Godard film "Je Vous
 Salue Marie." The Minister of Justice cut violent episodes
 from the Sylvester Stallone film "Cobra" and authorized its
 release to adult audiences only. Both actions were widely
 criticized in the intellectual community.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees the freedom of peaceful assembly.
 Although permits must be obtained for outdoor political or
 labor meetings, they are freely given.
 Labor has the right to organize, and trade unions are legally
 mandated to represent workers under the labor laws. Although
 the labor code makes no provision for a central or umbrella
 labor organization, three rival groups have emerged. The
 Government has not officially recognized their right to
 function but does engage in regular dialog with their
 leaders. To maintain the official labor structure, workers
 are taxed one day's pay per year, a sum which is paid to the
 Government and then divided among confederations, federations,
 and local unions. Ten to 15 percent of workers voluntarily
 pay union dues in addition to the mandatory tax. Most members
 join unions more for family health benefits than for
 representation on wages and working conditions. Although
 unions are legally prohibited from participating in partisan
 politics, a number do, but with little impact to date. Union
 organization activities have increased since the return of
 civilian government.
 The Government has not acted to prohibit strikes, even though
 existing legislation makes many strikes illegal, and has not
 enforced other restrictions on labor unions. In addition, the
 Government has reinstated the right of all labor leaders to
 hold union office. In three major 1986 strikes the federal
 Government mobilized police and troops to prevent violence and
 ensure the right of nonstrikers to cross picket lines.
 Employers have a legally mandated structure which parallels
 that of labor, and there are voluntary employer organizations
 not mandated by law. Both types of associations represent
 their members to government, act as lobbyists, and negotiate
 collective bargaining agreements with labor unions.
 Labor unions and employer associations may maintain ties with
 international organizations, but each affiliation has to be
 approved by the President of Brazil; because of exchange
 controls, the transfer of funds to pay membership charges
 requires Central Bank approval. The President and the Central
 Bank have a number of applications pending for association and
 transfer of funds.
 
 
 421
 BRAZIL
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no favored or state religion. An overwhelming
 majority of Brazilians belong to the Roman Catholic Church.
 All faiths are free to proselytize, establish places of
 worship, and train clergy. However, according to the National
 Council of Brazilian Bishops (CNBB), missionaries and other
 foreign religious visitors have had difficulty entering Brazil
 in recent years due to a 1980 immigration law. The CNBB
 complained in 1986 that visas for new missionaries and lay
 workers were being systematically delayed by immigration
 authorities. Plans to revise the immigration law have been
 announced by the Government, but action is not expected prior
 to enactment of the new constitution. The Catholic Church
 continued its political and social activism during 1986 with
 no government intervention. However, government ministers
 complained publicly that the Church was interfering in areas
 not of its legitimate concern.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within Brazil, nor are
 there any unusual restrictions on emigration. Brazil admits
 few immigrants and is selective in granting asylum.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 On March 15, 1985, Brazil's first civilian President in 21
 years was inaugurated. With the acquiescence of military
 leaders, two civilian presidential candidates were chosen, one
 a former governor of Sao Paulo with close ties to the
 military-dominated government and the other a long-time
 civilian opposition leader. The opposition leader, Tancredo
 Neves, was chosen President in indirect elections. His
 running mate, Jose Sarney, former president of the government
 party and long-time civilian politician, was elected Vice
 President. Although efforts to establish direct presidential
 elections failed, the indirect election of Neves through the
 electoral college was widely accepted as a return to civilian
 democracy. Neves was hospitalized for emergency abdominal
 surgery on the eve of his inauguration, and Sarney became
 interim president. Subsequently, Neves died, and Sarney was
 confirmed for a 6-year term with full presidential authority.
 Although the military-inspired 1967 Constitution concentrates
 effective political power in the presidency, Sarney has
 followed a more consensual style of government. The
 President's constitutional powers include the right to issue
 decree-laws in a number of key areas and, in the event of an.
 outbreak of war or threat of serious disturbance, to decree a
 state of siege which permits suspension of many civil rights.
 Major constitutional amendments passed by the federal Congress
 in 1985 removed numerous authoritarian restrictions and
 returned Brazil to full democratic status. Direct mayoral
 elections were held in all state capitals in 1985. National
 elections were held in November 1986 to elect state governors
 and legislative assemblies and a new federal Congress. All
 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and two-thirds of those in
 the Senate were filled, and the few remaining nonelected
 federal senators appointed before 1982 were replaced. Thirty
 parties representing the political spectrum participated in
 the election.
 
 
 422
 BRAZIL
 The direct election of federal congressmen and senators in
 November 1982 produced a representative Congress. The new
 Congress is expected to redefine and augment its powers under
 a constitution which it will draft sitting as a constituent
 assembly. State governors have been directly elected since
 1982, as have all municipal, state, and most federal
 legislators. All voting is secret and mandatory for all
 adults, except the illiterate who now may register to vote if
 they choose.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are a number of Brazilian nongovernmental organizations,
 such as the National Bar Association and the Brazilian Press
 Association, which are active in investigating and initiating
 legal proceedings in cases of alleged human rights
 violations. Amnesty International maintains offices in Rio
 and Sao Paulo. There have been no claims by any of these
 organizations that the Government has tried to impede their
 activities. There is a consensus among human rights observers
 in Brazil that the human rights situation has improved
 dramatically over the past several years. They believe that
 the main problems now concern police behavior toward suspects,
 prison conditions, and certain economic rights.
 The federal Solicitor-General in 1985 designated a federal
 prosecutor in each state to monitor and assist in
 denunciations of violations of human rights. In 1986 the
 Federal Council for the Defense of Human Rights, a
 presidential advisory group inactive under the military
 government, resumed activities with public meetings. As it
 began to take a more active role, the Council examined an
 increasing number of cases alleging lack of action by
 authorities in cases involving human rights abuses.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination on the basis of sex and race is illegal.
 Nevertheless, the proportion of women and blacks in the power
 structure is much smaller than their relative share of the
 population, a reflection of history, cultural attitudes, and
 economic disparities. Women are proportionally well
 represented among university students. A large majority of
 the black population is concentrated in the lowest economic
 strata.
 The country's estimated 200,000 Indians, living mostly in the
 interior; have suffered in recent decades from population
 movements by non-Indians into frontier areas. Despite the
 Government's commitment under the 1973 Indian statute to
 protect the Indian population, and despite efforts of the
 Indian Affairs Agency to demarcate tribal lands, Indians
 continue to suffer from government neglect, as isolated tribes
 come into greater contact and conflict with Brazil's expanding
 internal frontier.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The minimum age for employment is 12, but numerous legal
 restrictions theoretically apply to all working minors under
 age 18. Permission of parents or guardians is legally
 required for minors to work. Children from ages 12 to 14 are
 
 
 423
 BRAZIL
 legally allowed to work only if provision is made for them to
 attend school through completion of primary education, and
 only in light work that does not constitute a physical
 strain. All minors face restrictions against night employment
 and are prohibited from employment in unhealthy, dangerous, or
 morally harmful conditions. These laws do not extend to the
 types of occasional employment performed by millions of
 children and adolescents. Thirty-four percent of all children
 between the ages of 10 and 14 are considered economically
 active, and 65 percent of Brazilians between the ages of 15
 and 17 are employed.
 Brazil has a highly codified system of labor regulations,
 providing restrictions concerning workplace safety, a 48-hour
 maximum workweek, specified periods of rest and vacation, and
 a standardized minimum wage. Regulations concerning workplace
 safety are detailed, but enforcement suffers from an
 inadequate inspection staff.
 The minimum wage, which is defined as that "able to satisfy
 the normal necessities of the worker and his family," has
 averaged approximately $50 per month but was set at $58 in the
 February economic package. Prior to these reforms purchasing
 power was reduced by the practice of adjusting salaries only
 twice a year. A trade union-financed foundation calculates
 that the minimum necessary for a decent standard of living for
 a family of four is three to four times greater than the
 official minimum salary. In 1983, over 40 percent of those
 economically active earned less than the equivalent of one
 minimum salary; only 30 percent of all workers earned more
 than the equivalent of three minimum salaries.
