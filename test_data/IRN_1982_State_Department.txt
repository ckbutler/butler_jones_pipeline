 I RAN
 The revolution that began in Iran in 1978 and resulted in the
 overthrow of the Shah in early 1979 continues to this day.
 Like the French and Russian Revolutions before it, the Iranian
 Revolution is a fundamental and far-reaching reordering of the
 political and social structures. As in other such major
 upheavals, chaos magnifies the ideological excesses that
 seriously impinge on the human rights of its citizens.
 In marked contrast to the anti-clerical French and Russian
 Revolutions, the Iranian Revolution is fanatically religious.
 Iran terms itself an Islamic Republic. It is theoretically
 "republican" in the sense that its constitution, approved by
 popular referendum, follows a parliamentary pattern with a
 legislature, the Majlis, and a president elected by universal
 suffrage. Elections, however, are not free in that all
 candidates for office must be certified by the Ministry of
 Interior as meeting Islamic criteria. It is "Islamic" in its
 express belief that Iran should be governed by the "truth and
 justice" of the Koran (Islam's holy book) under the leadership
 of Ayatollah Imam Khomeini and in the provision of a Council of
 Guardians, which reviews bills to assure that they comply with
 Islamic law.
 The regime officially derives its legitimacy from the Majlis
 (Parliament) and from Islam. In practice, its hold on power is
 reinforced through intimidation, terror and other harsh
 methods. Constitutional guarantees of human rights'are ignored
 in practice.
 Irans political elite is composed of a group of Muslim clerics
 of the Shia sect, which predominates in Iran, and by laymen who
 have aligned themselves with these clerics. Opposition
 elements have not posed a serious threat to the regime since
 mid-1981 when a series of bombings killed many of Iran's
 principal leaders. Thousands of suspected Mujahedin were
 arrested, and many were executed, some summarily.
 The regime is not a cohesive one. Personal and ideological
 differences exist within the ruling entourage, and revolu-
 tionary institutions, notably the "komitehs" that control
 neighborhoods, and the Revolutionary Guards, a paramilitary
 organization, have-yet to be integrated into the formal power
 structure.
 Economically, Iran is an oil-rich developing country.  In the
 years prior to the revolution, Iran experienced rapid but
 uneven economic development; the disruptions of the last four
 years have caused serious economic deterioration. Economic
 growth rates dropped in the 1978-80 period and probably were
 stagnant in 1981-82. Oil revenue has been sufficient to fund
 enough imports of food to prevent hunger, and a rationing
 system assures that available supplies of basic necessities are
 reasonably equitably distributed. There have been persistent
 shortages of almost everything, including such basics as fuel,
 eggs, and soap. Inflation and unemployment are high, and black
 market activities flourish.
 The war with Iraq that began in September of 1980 continues.
 Iranian counterattacks succeeded in 1982 in pushing the Iraqis
 out of most Iranian territory. The Iranian attempt in July
 1982 to seize Iraqi territory in the Basra area was beaten back
 
 
 1138
 after six weeks of intensive fighting. Iran changed tactics in
 early October and launched a series of smaller scale attacks
 against Iraq at several points along the long border. These
 are designed to maintain military and political pressure on the
 Government of Iraq. Sporadic fighting has continued at several
 points along the border.
 The war has proved costly to both sides. The casualty rate has
 been high, and both sides have had to divert economic resources
 from development to the war effort. Both sides have attacked
 economic targets such as oil export terminals and factories.
 Iran claims that the war has created about one million refugees.
 Iran holds an. estimated 40,000 to 45,000 Iraqi POWs. In
 general, treatment of POWs appears to meet international
 standards but not all POWs have been visited by international
 groups, and there have been unsubstantiated reports of mass
 executions of Iraqi POWs at the front.
 There has been little change in the status of human rights in
 Iran in the last year. Executions continue, though at a rate
 considerably reduced from the 2,444 that took place in the last
 five months of 1981 (according to Amnesty International's
 report covering 1981). Victims of executions in 1982 included
 Sadeq Qotbzadeh, formerly the regime's Foreign Minister. A
 strong element of anarchy limits the human rights of Iranians.
 Iran is a country in which many have the authority to arrest
 but few have the authority to release.
 There is little reason to believe that the human rights
 -situation in Iran will improve in the near future. Over the
 longer term, as revolutionary fervor decreases and Iran begins
 to be more concerned about its world image, its treatment of
 its citizens may begin to improve.
 There is no evidence of official Government of Iran involvement
 in international terrorism. There are, however, allegations of
 the involvement of Iranians or groups associated with Iran in
 terrorist activities, including actions directed at the dip-
 lomatic community in Beirut. There are also allegations of
 Iranian involvement with subversive groups active in Gulf Arab
 states.
 1. Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 Reliable statistics on the number of killings in Iran are
 unavailable. Amnesty International estimates that 1,218
 persons were executed by the regime in the October 1981 to
 October 1982 period. These figures are based on publicly
 reported executions and are believed to be much lower than the
 actual total. Many executions are not announced, and there are
 no accurate estimates of other killings, though they are
 believed to be many. The Mujahedin-e-Khalq, a major opposition
 group, claims that 3,000 of its members have been shot by the
 revolutionary regime. According to the "Christian Science
 Monitor", some observers in Tehran claim that 10,000 have been
 executed since 1979, some by mistake.
 Killings may be divided into the following categories:
 i. Official: Summary executions continued, though at
 
 
 1139
 a rate reduced from the high reached in mid-1981 when 1,888
 persons were executed in a 3-month period.
 ii. Semi-official: Revolutionary Guard units
 continue to arrest and execute persons alleged to have commit-
 ted crimes. In these cases the executions are likely to be
 summary or with the merest imitation of a trial.
 iii. War Related:  Iranian tactics used in the war
 with Iraq result in a larger and crueler loss of life than has
 been the case in other recent conventional wars. There have
 been reports that very young children, most in their early
 teens, but some apparently as young as 9 and 10 years of age,
 have been recruited into the Basij (a loosely structured
 militia group composed mainly of boys and men in their teens
 and early twenties) and sent to the front. Their emotions
 fanned by religious zealots, and convinced that they are doing
 the will of Allah and will go straight to heaven, these
 children have been used in human wave attacks against the
 regular Iraqi military. There are also unconfirmed reports
 that these groups may have been used to clear mine fields.
 iv. Opposition Groups: Although apparently neutral-
 ized, at least for the moment, as a viable political alterna-
 tive to the current regime, various opposition groups have re-
 tained the ability to disrupt life in Iran. Several large
 bombs were detonated in Tehran in the summer of 1982. Most
 were planted in busy public areas and killed 5 to 50 people
 when they went off, injuring many more. Victims in most of
 these cases were innocent bystanders. Opposition groups have
 also continued to pressure Iran's clerical leadership. There
 are frequent reports of assassinations of mullahs, including
 two with the rank of ayatollah. The favored tactic in these
 assassinations is for an individual to approach the religious
 leader and to detonate a grenade strapped to his body, killing
 himself as well.
 Unidentified opposition groups have attacked Revolutionary
 Guard groups, killing an unknown number. While many of those
 are killed in armed clashes the Iranian press-has published
 particularly gory photographs of Revolutionary Guards who were
 reportedly tortured, burned, and buried alive.
 Insurrection in Iran's Kurdish areas predates the revolution.
 An unknown number of Kurdish dissidents and Iranian military
 personnel have died in military actions in this area and there
 are a few unconfirmed reports of retaliatory acts against
 civilians in Kurdish villages by Iranian military or Revolutio-
 nary Guard.
 b. Disappearance
 Disappearances, while comprising only a small fraction of
 arrests in Iran, remain a problem. The Iranian regime tends to
 arrest openly, and in those few cases in which persons have
 simply disappeared, relatives, through persistent effort, can
 often learn where the individual is held. There are, however,
 instances in which relatives have learned of executions on
 television, or have been forced to check cemetery records to
 determine the fate of family members. The regime has denied
 all knowledge of 14 Bahali leaders arrested in 1979 and 1980,
 including all nine persons who comprised the Baha'i National
 Administrative Council at the time of their arrest (August 21,
 1980). Bodies of some of the 150 persons taken from Evin
 
 
 1140
 prison by Revolutionary Guards on the night of September 4,
 1980, were subsequently found, but the fate of many of them
 remains undetermined.
 c. Torture
 Charges of torture by the Shah's regime were a main rallying
 cry of the revolution, and torture is specifically prohibited
 by the Iranian Constitution. The practice, nonetheless, con-
 tinues. Beatings and solitary confinement are common. In
 Tehran's Evin prison, there is reportedly a "cellar of truth"
 in which prisoners are tortured with cigarettes and hot irons.
 Other reports are of whipping, beating the soles of the feet,
 and mock executions. A number of reported executions are
 believed to be cover-ups for deaths under torture.
 In addition to Evin, torture occurs in other Iranian prisons
 and in facilities throughout Iran used by the Revolutionary
 Guards. Residents in the vicinity of the still-occupied
 American Embassy compound report having heard screams from
 within, indicating that this, too, is a site for torture and
 incarceration.
 Virtually all this torture is perpetrated by the revolutionary
 Government. There is no recourse nor any prospect of discipli-
 nary action being taken.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Iranian interpretations of Islamic law are replacing iran's
 pre-revolutionary legal codes. Traditional Islamic law, which
 in past centuries encompassed all of civil and criminal law,
 prescribes specific punishments that are, by modern interna-
 tional standards, cruel. Under its provisions, adulterers are
 subjected to public stoning, and thieves may have their fingers
 or hands cut off. There are reports of these punishments being
 applied although their application does not yet appear to be
 widespread throughout Iran. Nevertheless, Iran is one of only
 four countries where such punishments were applied by govern-
 ment authorities in 1982. What is apparently more common is
 whippings, both in public and in prison. Many of these are
 administered without trial by Revolutionary Guards.
 Conditions in prisons are said to be very bad. Many persons
 are generally cramped into a single cell, and prisoners are
 sometimes kept blindfolded. Prisoners report hearing the
 screams of those being tortured in the night as well as execu-
 tions.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment are rampant, with Revolution-
 ary Guards the worst offenders. There are no available esti-
 mates either of the numbers of arrests or of how many of these
 can be considered arbitrary. However, all the jails are seri-
 ously overcrowded, and travelers from Iran report that several
 hotels in Tehran and provincial cities have been taken over and
 converted into jails.
 There is no equivalent to a writ of habeas corpus; prisoners
 have been known to remain in jail for months without formal
 charges being lodged against them. Charges, when they are
 lodged, are frequently vague and hard to define; "corruption on
 earth," "crimes against God," and "un-Islamic behavior" have
 
 
 1141
 all been grounds for arrest and execution. Many arrests are as
 much a function of personal revenge as offenses against the
 regime. Businessmen whose major crime was firing an individual
 whose cousin subsequently became a Revolutionary Guard have
 been jailed.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Despite constitutional guarantees of a fair public trial with
 legal representation, most trials in Iran are now neither fair
 nor public. Except for petty criminal cases, trials are almost
 never open to the public, and are often simply a method of im-
 plementing a verdict already reached. In fact, the regime fre-
 quently regards due legal process as a waste of time and
 money. This attitude is exemplified by a speech made by
 Khomeini in July 1979..."all this about a lawyer being need-
 ed... and that their pleas should be listened to--these are not
 people charged with a crime, these are criminals." In a
 September 1981 interview on Tehran radio, Majlis Deputy
 Musavi-Tabrizi said "...no delay will be made for they will not
 be allowed to go to jail to be fed and rest for several months
 thus wasting the treasury's funds. They will be tried in the
 streets. They have taken up Molotov cocktails and stood up
 against the Islamic Republic system. In such cases they will
 be tried on the spot."
 The legal system is highly politicized. Revolutionary courts
 are replacing the old court system, because many of the former
 judges are not considered to be sufficiently Islamic, and the
 old legal system is seen as badly tainted by "Western" influ-
 ences. MoreoVer, the regime does not believe the judicial
 system ought to be independent.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Private residences in Iran are not "private" since they are
 subject to invasion by the regime, or Revolutionary Guards, at
 any time. Guards may enter in search of suspects or to assure
 that the inhabitants are not behaving in an "un-Islamic"
 manner, that there is no liquor on the premises, that there are
 no social gatherings involving men and women who are not relat-
 ed, or that there is no "subversive" literature.
 Personal property has been taken over by the Revolutionary
 Guard, particularly if the owners have left the country or have
 been jailed. Property owned by Baha'is has been confiscated
 even when the owner remained in Iran. This is often done in
 the name of the deprived (Mostazafin), and in some cases poor
 families are in fact installed in confiscated residences. Per-
 haps more frequently, homes become quarters for the Revolution-
 ary Guards, and automobiles are appropriated by mullahs. There
 are unconfirmed rumors that the proceeds of auctions of person-
 al effects confiscated in the name of the deprived in fact find
 their way to personal bank accounts of some of the leaders of
 the regime.
 Telephones are monitored and mail is subject to inspection.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Iranian Constitution guarantees its citizens freedom of
 speech and the press. Actual practice differs. Criticism of
 
 
 1142
 the regime, oral or written, subjects the critic to immediate
 arrest and possible execution. The regime, however, is not
 cohesive and there is some discussion of various policies and
 practices in the media. For example, an attack on the
 "hojjatieh," a government faction, was printed in Tehran news-
 papers. Criticism must be couched in acceptable terms, and
 some subjects, such as criticism of Khomeini, are completely
 taboo. Newspapers that overstep their bounds are shut down.
 The only acceptable forms of literature and art are "Islamic"
 ones. Western music is forbidden, most Western and Marxist
 books are considered subversive. All universities have been
 closed since 1978 and are likely to remain so for the foresee-
 able future, with the exception of the medical facilities which
 were recently re-opened. Primary and secondary school text-
 books are being rewritten, and there is no academic freedom.
 Representatives of the regime are posted in schools to assure
 compliance with guidelines, and Khomeini has publicly exhorted
 school children to inform on teachers, parents, and classmates.
 b.  Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The only forms of assembly permitted in Iran are for religious
 observances and political rallies or demonstrations sponsored
 by the regime.
 Formal labor unions do not exist. During the revolutionary
 period workers councils sprang up in many factories and took
 control. These groups held managers ransom for higher wages,
 severance pay, and other material benefits. More recently,
 however,, the serious state of the economy has caused the regime
 to oppose work stoppages and demands for higherwages. Report-
 edly, 45 strikers at the former General Motors plant were ar-
 rested in April 1982. Protestors from the Telecommunications
 Company of Iran were arrested at about the same time, and their
 demonstration for higher wages violently suppressed. Workers
 councils are being replaced by "Islamic Societies" whose
 leaders are more loyal to the regime.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the state religion, and the Islamic Republic is under-
 stood as a state of the Muslim Community ostensibly based on
 early Islamic practice. The Constitution specifically recog-
 nizes the Christian, Jewish, and Zoroastrian religions and
 their followers' right to practice their religions, but the
 intensively Islamic nature of the regime makes life difficult
 for these minority groups. To date, although these groups have
 been able, at least in the Tehran area, to maintain their
 places of worship and their schools, their futures are not
 secure.
 Members of religious minorities must comply with Islamic codes
 of behavior in public. Women, for instance, must wear the
 veil. There is some dispute between these groups and the
 regime as to whether or not social clubs composed of members of
 religious minorities are classified as public or private
 places. The minorities argue that they should be permitted to
 behave in accordance with the tenets of their own religions at
 these clubs, while the regime has sought to discourage these
 activities. Members of recognized religious minorities would
 not receive equal protection under the traditional Islamic
 system that Khomeini hopes to implement. For example, retribu-
 tion.payment (required under Islamic law) for the murder of a
 
 
 1143
 non-Muslim is half that for a Muslim, and the rate for women is
 half that for men. (The life of a non-Muslim woman, for ex-
 ample, would be worth one fourth that of a Muslim man.) More-
 over, members of religious minorities tend to belong to the
 traditionally wealthier, better educated, and most "Westerniz-
 ed" groups in Iranian society. They are considered suspect by
 the regime on both religious and social grounds.
 The regime is fiercely anti-Zionist, often with no apparent
 distinction between its anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism.
 Iranian Jews have been forced to make public anti-Israeli
 statements and are always in danger of being seen as subversive
 agents whose loyalty to Iran is suspect. A few executions have
 taken place on charges that included Zionism, apparently
 because those executed were Jews.
 The Baha'is in Iran have suffered most among the religious
 minorities. Because the Baha'is' faith is regarded as a heresy
 by Muslims, it does not enjoy the traditional or constitutional
 protection granted the other principal religious minorities. A
 number of government leaders belong to a society specifically
 directed at the extirpation of the Baha'i faith. Baha'i
 leaders have been systematically arrested by the regime, charg-
 ed with "corruption on earth" or "crimes against God" and ex-
 ecuted. Baha'is may not hold government jobs, and after exten-
 sive nationalization of the economy, this prohibition severely
 limits employment opportunities. Employment in private in-
 dustry is also discouraged by the Government. There have been
 a few incidents of mob attacks'on Bahali families and on their
 homes and businesses in various parts of Iran, often resulting
 in the destruction of buildings and sometimes in deaths.
 Baha'i businesses have been seized, cemeteries desecrated, and
 places of worship and principal shrines destroyed. Such mob
 actions, which in some cases have involved torture of Baha'i
 victims, are not restrained by local authorities but rather
 seen in most cases to be encouraged by them. There are no
 known cases of punishments for such acts of violence. Since
 Baha'i marriages are not recognized by the regime, women have
 been arrested and charged with prostitution. A total of at
 least 131 Baha'is, mostly leaders of the community, have been
 executed or killed since the revolution began, and several
 hundred were reportedly in prison as of late 1982.
 Since most Sunni Muslims in Iran belong to disadvantaged ethnic
 minority groups, notably the Kurds and Baluchis, it is diffi-
 cult to determine the degree to which repression or discrim-
 ination directed against such groups has a religious basis.
 However, there are press reports of attempts to impose Shilite
 Islam on Sunni Kurdish areas.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within The Country
 There are no known official restrictions on travel within Iran,
 but, as a practical matter, numerous revolutionary guard
 checkpoints and questioning of travelers may discourage
 movement. Foreign travel is allowed, but exit visas are
 difficult to obtain. Until late summer of 1982, exit visas
 were virtually impossible for Iranians to obtain. Exit
 requirements were subsequently relaxed for some 20 different
 categories, based primarily on family connections outside of
 Iran. Parents of students enrolled in schools outside Iran,
 for example, are allowed to visit their children. Men of draft
 age are generally not given exit visas, and those with talents
 
 15-480 0 - 83 - 73
 
 
 1144
 the regime values highly, such as medical doctors, are report-
 edly'required to post substantial bonds before departure.
 Iran has a sizeable refugee population consisting of an
 estimated 45,000 to 60,000 persons of Iranian origin expelled
 from Iraq since 1980, and about one million Afghans who have
 fled Afghanistan as a result of the Soviet invasion and
 occupation of that country. There is no evidence that these
 people are mistreated or forced back across the border.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Iran is ruled by an oligarchy of mullahs and their non-clerical
 associates. Sufferage is universal, and women have the-right
 both to vote and to run for public office. At least two women
 serve in the Majlis. Women may not, however, be named to
 judicial positions.
 Participation in elections is widespread, in part because the
 identity cards of voters are marked, and many fear retribution
 such as loss of job or refusal of an exit permit, if they do
 not vote. Members of religious minorities, except Baha'is,
 select special delegates to represent them in the Majlis.
 Ballot boxes for these minorities are frequently located in
 places of worship, thus making obvious the vote of the minori-
 ties on referendum questions such as the approval of the
 Constitution and other policy issues.
 Candidates are screened by the Ministry of Interior and no one
 considered unacceptable is permitted to run. One must be
 acceptable to the revolutionary elite to participate actively
 in public affairs, but within set limits there is freedom of
 choice and a degree of political diversity. An unknown number
 of Majlis seats were contested in the 1980 election by two or
 more candidates, and voters have relatively free choice among
 these candidates. Important issues such as land reform are
 debated in the Majlis, and like land reform, some have been
 efffectively blocked by opposition groups.  (Opposition in this
 context means a group opposed to a particular measure, not a
 group opposed to the basic thrust of government policy.) A
 Deputy Speaker of the Majlis who was considered too radical was
 replaced by a relative moderate through elections in the
 Majlis. To date, nominees for cabinet positions have been
 approved by large majorities, but with a few votes in oppo-
 sition.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Iran is not a member of any international human rights body.
 Rather, the regime has taken the position that international
 human rights concerns are irrelevant to Iran's Islamic revolu-
 tion.
 Iran was criticized for human rights violations, in particular
 the persecution of the Baha'i, by the UN Human Rights Commis-
 sion (UNHRC) Subcommittee on Prevention of Discrimination and
 Protection of Minorities in September of 1980, and again in
 September of 1981. In March 1982 a resolution critical of
 Iran's human rights performance was passed by the full UNHRC.
 Iran's Ambassador to the Vatican in appearing before the UN
 Human Rights Commission in Geneva in July 1982, said that if a
 
 
 1145
 conflict arose between the laws of men and divine law, it was
 not difficult to see which laws ought to prevail. He termed
 the Baha'i problem "ridiculous" and denounced the "imperialist
 myth of human rights."
 Discussions on the subject of human rights with non--
 governmental groups have been minimal, since Iran refuses to
 respond. Amnesty International sent representatives to Iran in
 1979, but has been unable to gain admission for a second visit
 despite a specific request in late 1981. Terms limiting access
 to prisons and prisoners imposed by the Iranian regime would
 make it impossible for Amnesty or other human rights organiza-
 tions to investigate. The coercive nature of the regime makes
 it impossible for any Iranian human rights group to operate
 within Iran.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 There are no reliable statistics available from Iran for the
 post-revolutionary period. The following economic and social
 indictors should be taken as rough estimates based on statis-
 tics from the mid-1970s. The population is about 38 million,
 with a population growth rate of 3 percent per annum. Life
 expectancy at birth is 54 years, and the infant death rate was
 14 per 1,000 live births in the mid to late 1970s. Given
 reduced social services, life expectancy and infant mortality
 figures may be somewhat optimistic for 1982.
 The adult literacy rate is roughly 50 percent. Primary school
 enrollment in the mid-1970s was over 100 percent, probably re-
 flecting enrollment in adult literacy programs. Much of this
 has changed since the revolution. Primary and secondary
 schools are operating, but universities, with the exception of
 the partiallly re-opened medical facilities, are closed.
 In 1977 GNP was (U.S.) $77.8 billion and per capita income
 (U.S.) $2,160. Both of these figures have dropped sharply in
 real terms, but the lack of data precludes a reliable
 percentage estimate. Iran has been able to maintain oil
 exports at a level sufficient to assure that basic necessities
 are available to its citizens and to allow the regime to
 continue to wage the war with Iraq. Shortages of many goods
 are frequent, and luxuries are non-existent. Support of the
 regime comes from the lower classes who form the vast majority
 of Iran's population. The Government has taken care to see
 that the basic needs of these groups are met. Economic hard-
 ship has been far harder on the middle and upper income
 groups. Income statistics that would permit a determination of
 the percentage below the poverty line are not available for
 Iran.
