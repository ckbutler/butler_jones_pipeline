 NIGER
 The armed forces of Niger seized control of the Govern-
 ment in April 1974, claiming that corruption was wide-
 spread and that emergency measures were necessary to deal
 with the critical food shortage resulting from the Sahel
 drought. Key members of the ousted government were im-
 prisoned. Several still remain under house arrest, but
 most have been released and some have been reinstated at
 high levels.
 Upon taking power, the military government suspended
 Niger's constitution and placed restrictions on the free-
 dom of expression, assembly, and political activity. Al-
 though the Government rules by decree, the judicial system
 remains intact. The authority traditionally accorded
 chiefs and the pre-independence French legal system con-
 stitute the basis for the administration of justice in civil
 and criminal cases.
 Economic development is the military government's top
 priority, with greatest emphasis placed on self-sufficiency
 in food production. Mounting revenues from minerals exploi-
 tation are almost completely devoted to the most pressing
 needs of the Nigerien people. But living standards (and
 per capita income) remain among the lowest in the world.
 The military government still refers to itself as "provi-
 sional", but the President has recently indicated that he
 considers Niger is far from ready for democratic rule. A
 recent cabinet reshuffle, however, has continued the gradual
 movement toward greater civilian participation in the
 administration. Only six of 18 cabinet positions now
 are held by military officers.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There are no reports of the use of torture in Niger.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There are no reports of such treatment or punishment in
 Niger, nor is there evidence of arbitrary deprivation
 of life or inhumane prison conditions. Nutrition and
 health care of prisoners does not differ markedly from that
 of the population generally.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 With the constitution suspended, there is no specific
 institutional guarantee of the right not to be subjected to
 arbitrary arrest or imprisonment.   A few incidents of
 arrest and imprisonment without due process have occurred.
 Most involved either members of the previous regime or
 of the Sawaba Party, which has been banned since inde-
 pendence. Amnesty International reported in 1976 that
 it had taken up the cases of 18 persons, most from the Swaba
 group, who were accused of plotting against the Government
 
 
 139
 and jailed without trial. As of 1979, 12 remain imprisoned.
 No other information is available.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trials are available for civil and criminal
 cases not involving political acts. Cases involving politi-
 cal acts, such as those of the plotters executed in connec-
 tion with a March 1976 attempted coup, are handled by spe-
 cially designated military courts. There is no evidence
 that courts are subject to political influence or pressure in
 ordinary criminal and civil cases.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The inviolability of the home is respected but not guaranteed
 by law, given the suspension of the constitution.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 In this extremely poor, rural economy, annual per capita
 income remains below 200 dollars and education, health care
 and shelter are all inadequate by the standards of the
 developed world. However, foreign aid and mining revenues
 have permitted the Government to increase expenditures from
 $13 per person in 1974 to $53 in 1979. The Government has
 sought to reduce the tax burden of its poorest citizens,
 removing the so-called head tax, which was a particular
 hardship for those outside the cash economy. The Government
 devotes most of its uranium mining revenues to the National
 Investment Fund, which is used exclusively to finance devel-
 opment activities identified in the National Development
 Plan. The emphasis is on projects in health, agriculture and
 rural infra-structure. Since 1974, the defense share of the
 national budget has declined from 8.2 percent to 6.3 percent,
 while expenditures on education, rural development, public
 works and health have risen to 55 percent.
 Niger's people have traditionally held personal ethics,
 justice, and fair play in high regard. Corruption of
 government officials is not a serious problem and is swiftly
 dealt with when discovered. Working conditions and minimum
 wages (which concern the small but growing number of salaried
 workers) reflect the widely-shared desire for equity.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 These freedoms are restricted in Niger. Dissent is rarely
 voiced openly. Some forms of voluntary association and
 expression such as trade unions, churches and other religious
 groups are, however, generally permitted provided that these
 activities are non-political or consistent with government
 policy. Although the population is over 90 percent Muslim,
 Christian churches operate. However, in at least one in-
 stance, the Government refused to issue permanent residence
 permits to evangelists of a religious sect. The news media
 
 
 140
 are government controlled, but there is some degree of
 editorial independence, especially on local issues such as
 food prices and local health services.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There have been no reports of restrictions on movement
 within the country. Foreign travel and emigration from
 Niger require government concurrence in the form of an
 exit visa which is granted routinely.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Freedom to participate in the political process is restrict-
 ed. The Supreme Military Council (SMC) directs the executive
 branch and is composed of the Army officers who organized
 the 1974 coup. The president of the SMC is also chief
 of state and president of the Council of Ministers. Although
 political parties are barred, members of the Government
 are sensitive to urban popular opinion and also maintain
 contact with remote rural populations through frequent
 official visits. The Government makes policy decisions by
 decree. In the five years since the military seized power
 there has been a steady transition toward greater civilian
 participation at the highest level of the administration.
 The freedom of women to participate in this traditional
 Muslim society is limited but growing. The Government
 has taken modest steps to encourage progress in this field
 including the appointment of a few women to high level
 civil service positions. The Association of Nigerien Women
 has been formed at the initiative of the President.
 Unions closely follow Government labor and development
 policy, but all basic labor rights are respected. All
 workers, including civil servants, have the right to strike.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 There have been no requests for outside investigations
 of human rights in Niger. Amnesty International states
 that officials of the Government have answered their in-
 quiries about human rights and that these replies have been
 prompt and forthcoming.
