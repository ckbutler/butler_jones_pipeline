 THE FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA
 The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is a nation of 607
 islands, mostly uninhabited, extending over 1 million square
 miles of ocean in the Central Pacific. Four states, Pohnpei,
 Truk, Yap, and Kosrae, comprise the federation. It was
 formerly a district of a United Nations Trust Territory
 administered by the United States from 1947 to 1986. In
 November 1986 it emerged as a sovereign, self-governing nation
 under the Compact of Free Association with the United States.
 The population, of Micronesian origin, is estimated at 97,000
 people.
 Political legitimacy rests on the popular will expressed by a
 majority vote in accordance with the Constitution, which is
 based in large part on the U.S. model. There are three
 branches of government: a president as chief executive and
 head of state, a unicameral legislature elected from the four
 constituent states, and a judiciary system closely paralleling
 U.S. criminal and civil laws and procedures. The economy
 depends heavily on transfer payments from the United States,
 fishing, tourism, and subsistence agriculture. No human
 rights abuses were reported in 1988.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No political killings occurred.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no disappearances or abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were no reports of these practices.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Legal procedure follows U.S. law in its provisions for due
 process. These provisions are carefully observed. There is
 no exile.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Public trial is provided for in the Bill of Rights, and trials
 are conducted fairly. Juveniles may have closed hearings.
 The Chief Justice, currently an American, is appointed by the
 President.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The law prohibits such arbitrary interference, and in practice
 there is none.

 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These rights are constitutionally assured and faithfully
 observed. There is one small, privately owned newspaper. A
 private, religiously oriented radio station was licensed by
 the Government and began broadcasting on Pohnpei island in May.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These rights are also provided for in the Bill of Rights.
 During political campaigns, citizens often take advantage of
 them to question candidates at public meetings. Formal
 associations are uncommon in Micronesia. Nevertheless,
 student organizations and at least one lobbying group exist.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Federated States is extremely hospitable to diverse
 religions, and missionaries of many faiths work within the
 nation. The Bill of Rights forbids establishment of a state
 religion and governmental restrictions on freedom of
 religion. Most of the citizens are Christians, with both
 Catholics and Protestants well represented.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions in any of these areas. The Compact
 of Free Association permits citizens to travel to, reside in,
 and work in the United States without visa restrictions.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Congress is elected by popular vote from each state;
 Congress then chooses the President and Vice President from
 its ranks by majority vote. State governors, state
 legislators, and municipal governments are all elected by
 direct popular vote. Elections are conducted honestly, and
 political campaigning is unrestricted. Although there are no
 restrictions on political groups, there has been no interest
 in forming political parties.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No violations have ever been alleged, nor are there any known
 requests for investigations. The Federated States does not
 belong to the United Nations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides explicit protection against
 discrimination based on race, sex, language, or religion. The
 various traditional cultures establish hierarchies of social
 status, and these traditional rankings can influence access to
 political office and education, even though such access is in
 principle open to all. Traditional culture is greatly
 respected by the peoples of the Federated States, and is
 protected by Article V of the Constitution. Nevertheless, the

 THE FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA
 traditional social orders are losing ground as Westernization
 takes a greater hold upon young people. Male dominance in the
 modern economy has hampered women from taking a more active
 role in the monetary economy. This is changing, and an
 increasing number of women are finding jobs in the skilled,
 semiskilled, and social occupations.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 National government employees have the right, by law, to form
 associations to "present their views" to the Government. The
 Constitution states that "no law may deny or impair freedom of
 expression, peaceable assembly, association, or petition."
 These limits are observed by the Congress. There are as yet,
 however, no trade unions in this largely nonindustrial society.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no law dealing specifically with trade unions or with
 the right to collective bargaining. There are no special
 economic areas set aside, and labor standards and practices
 are the same throughout the islands.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution specifically prohibits involuntary servitude
 and there is no evidence of its practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There is no law establishing a minimum age for employment of
 children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The minimum wage for national government employees is $1.25
 per hour. While there is no legally established minimum wage
 for other types of employment, wages for unskilled workers
 vary from $0.80 to $1.25 per hour under current customs and
 practices. These wages are sufficient to provide an
 acceptable standard of living under local conditions. There
 are no laws regulating hours of work or prescribing standards
 of occupational safety and health, but a Federated States'
 regulation requires that employers provide a safe place of
 employment.
