 IVORY COAST
 Ivory Coast, a former French colony until independence in
 1960, is a civilian one-party state. Power is concentrated in
 the Democratic Party of Ivory Coast and its long-time leader,
 President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, now 80 years old. Although
 the freedom to form other parties is theoretically guaranteed
 by the Constitution, in practice, no other party has been
 allowed. More open discussion of government policies has been
 permitted in the period since the country's first competitive
 elections in 1980 for local party, municipal, and legislative
 positions. The unicameral National Assembly has never
 challenged a policy put forth by the executive branch,
 however. As provided by law, competitive elections within the
 Democratic Party (at five-year intervals) were held in late
 1985 for municipal offices, the legislature, and the
 presidency. Houphouet-Boigny was reelected to a sixth 5-year
 term as President.
 The Surete National, the national police service structured
 along French lines, includes an arm tasked with intelligence
 gathering and counterespionage responsibilities. It is a part
 of the Ministry of Internal Security.
 Ivory Coast has enjoyed considerable economic development
 since independence, but poverty still prevails in much of the
 country. The Ivorian economy is market-oriented and open to
 foreign investment. It showed steady growth until the
 beginning of the current decade. Over the last four years,
 however, Ivory Coast has been squeezed by a heavy debt burden
 and low prices for its exports on world markets. The
 austerity measures which the Government has introduced to
 offset this reduced income have been broadly accepted by key
 elements of the population. Gross domestic product (GDP) was
 expected to rise between two and three percent in real terms
 in 1985. Nonetheless, the quality of government financial
 management of the economy will continue to be a key
 determinant of the country's future economic health.
 There was no change in the human rights situation in 1985.
 The President advocates "dialogue" in settling disputes,
 generally seeking to involve dissenters in the operation of
 the Ivorian system rather than isolate or imprison them.
 There are no known political prisoners in Ivory Coast, and
 there has never been an execution of political opponents.
 Detainees, especially foreign Africans, are routinely treated
 roughly by the Surete National and the Gendarmerie upon
 arrest. Riots directed against foreign Africans occurred in
 1985, as on occasion in the past. However, there is no
 history of violent or repressive action against specific
 ethnic or religious minorities.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There have never been reports of political killings by forces
 with official sanction.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of abduction or disappearance of persons
 by forces with official sanction.

 IVORY COAST
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Ivorian penal code prohibits the use of violence by
 official means without legitimate justification. The code
 does not, however, specifically mention or prohibit torture
 nor does it define what constitutes "legitimate justification"
 or the level of violence officials may use. There were no
 reports of torture during 1985, and systematic cruel, inhuman,
 or degrading treatment of persons or prison inmates is not
 thought to occur. Since the beginning of a state-sponsored
 anticrime campaign in 1983, some detainees, primarily foreign
 Africans, have reportedly been denied adequate food and drink,
 beaten by police, and forced to do menial labor. While
 foreign Africans are treated more roughly by police than are
 Ivorian detainees, once offenders are committed to prison
 there is no evidence of discriminatory treatment of prisoners
 on the basis of sex, Ivorian ethnic background, race, or type
 of crime. Prisoners are allowed visits from attorneys of
 their choice and from family members, who must provide food to
 supplement the sparse prison diet. Prisons are crowded and
 conditions poor. .Sanitation and medical facilities are
 limited.
 Ivory Coast marked its 25th anniversary of independence on
 December 7, 1985, by releasing 9,500 of its 13,000 convicted
 prisoners. Prisoners involved in violent crimes and armed
 robbery were reportedly not included in the amnesty.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Ivorian Constitution and pertinent statutes prohibit
 arbitrary arrest or imprisonment. People are not detained,
 punished, or tried for expression of views critical of or
 different from those of the Government. However, the
 Government has occasionally detained a few persons it believes
 to pose a threat to internal security. It also takes firm
 nonviolent measures against acts it considers threats to
 internal security. The Government has used the threat of
 forced conscription to discourage student involvement in
 antigovernment activities. Some prominent critics of the
 Government have chosen to live and write elsewhere; on the
 other hand, political exiles from a number of countries have
 found Ivory Coast a hospitable safe haven.
 Under the Ivorian penal code, a public prosecutor can detain a
 suspect for up to 48 hours without bringing charges. The code
 dictates that further detention must be ordered by a
 magistrate who can authorize periods of up to four months but
 must provide the Minister of Justice, on a monthly basis, with
 a written explanation of why detention should be continued.
 There is no forced labor in Ivory Coast.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Ivorian law establishes the right to a fair public trial.
 This provision is generally respected in urban centers. In
 rural areas justice is often administered at the village level
 through traditional institutions. The judiciary is
 independent of the executive and military. Defendants accused
 of felonies or capital crimes have the right to legal counsel,
 and the judicial system provides for court-appointed attorneys
 for indigent defendants. In practice, however, such attorneys
 
 
 IVORY COAST
 are not readily available. The court of appeals reviews
 verdicts of civilian courts. Civilians are not tried by
 military courts. There is no structure of appellate courts
 within the military justice system. Persons convicted by a
 military tribunal occasionally request the Supreme Court to
 set aside the tribunal's verdict and order a retrial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 With few exceptions, all Ivorian citizens are considered to be
 members of the Democratic Party of Ivory Coast. Party
 regulations call for active participation in party activities
 and payment of dues; however, these regulations are not
 strictly enforced. Ivorians who choose not to participate do
 not suffer retaliation. It is'not known what percentage of
 the population actively participates in the party. The code
 of penal procedures specifies that a police official or
 investigative magistrate may conduct searches of homes without
 a warrant if he has reason to believe there is evidence
 concerning a crime on the premises. The official must have
 the prosecutor's agreement to retain any objects seized in the
 search. He is required to have witnesses to the search, which
 may not take place between the hours of 9 p.m. and 4 a.m.
 Legal safeguards against arbitrary searches are generally
 respected in the modern parts of cities. In less developed
 urban sectors and in rural areas, legal safeguards are
 sometimes ignored. There were scattered reports of forced
 entry or other violations of the home, specifically involving
 foreign Africans, during 1985. There is no evidence'of
 monitoring of correspondence and telephone conversations.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Despite Ivory Coast's established one-party.state, there is a
 large measure of freedom of speech. Critics of the Government
 feel free to, and do, express themselves in informal
 situations, among Ivorians and foreigners alike, without fear
 of reprisal. However, some Ivorians do not feel free to
 express their views openly, and public criticism of basic
 government policies or of the party and the president rarely
 occurs. Limits--such as the cancellation of gatherings--are
 occasionally placed on the expression of controversial views
 in public forums. As a result of 1982 student disorders, only
 apolitical gatherings are now permitted on campus, but
 students still speak freely about politics in informal
 situations.
 The country's one daily newspaper is owned by private
 interests, but its editorial opinion follows the policies of
 the country's single political party. The one weekly news
 magazine is controlled by the party. The Ministry of
 Information operates a wire service, radio, and television.
 Government policy assigns the media a positive role in
 promoting national unity and development. It allows criticism
 of failures of policy execution but not of the policies
 themselves. Investigative journalism is permitted except with
 respect to the Government and its policies. The Government
 has occasionally banned a critical publication such as Islam
 and Ivory Coast. In September 1984, the leadership of the
 party issued an official statement denouncing an
 antigovernment tract circulating in Abidjan. Foreign
 
 
 152
 IVORY COAST
 publications are readily available, but occasionally issues
 which are particularly critical of the Ivorian Government, the
 party, or the President are seized.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is generally respected in Ivory Coast,
 except when the Government perceives a significant and
 immediate danger to public order. In such infrequent cases,
 the Government prohibits meetings and arrests persons
 disregarding its orders. Such a case occurred on November 22,
 1985, when university students, after discussing their
 grievances with government officials, staged public
 demonstrations to protest against a drop in scholarship aid.
 The demonstrators reportedly committed acts of violence,
 whereupon university officials summoned security forces which
 arrested approximately 400 students, the vast majority of whom
 were released shortly thereafter.
 The majority of unions are organized and directed by a
 government-sponsored union confederation, the General Union of
 Ivory Coast Workers (UGTCI), the leader of which occupies a
 senior position in the party hierarchy. Membership is
 encouraged but not mandatory. The UGTCI is a relatively
 passive coordination mechanism rather than an active
 campaigner for workers' rights. The right to strike exists in
 theory, but in practice strikes are rarely authorized. The
 1983 secondary teachers' strike was broken by a presidential
 decree ordering teachers back to the.classrooms and
 threatening them with prison sentences and fines for
 noncompliance. Generally, the Government negotiates with
 strikers and resolves at least some of their economic
 grievances. There have been no reports that professional
 groups have experienced persecution or harassment. The
 Government, however, attempts to bring such groups under its
 wing or that of the party so as to exercise control over their
 activities. Unions, trade associations, and professional
 bodies are permitted to maintain relations with recognized
 international professional bodies in their fields. The UGTCI
 is a member of the continent-wide organization of African
 Trade Union Unity.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There are no known impediments to religious expression in
 Ivory Coast. There is no dominant religion, and no particular
 faith is favored by the Government. The open practice of
 religion is permitted, and there are no restrictions on
 religious ceremonies or teaching. Better paying government
 and private sector jobs seem to be concentrated among the
 minority Muslim (25 percent) and Christian (15 percent)
 populations, a phenomenon attributable more to urbanization
 and access to education than to a systematic pattern of
 discrimination.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Ivorian Government exercises minimal control over domestic
 travel, but internal roadblocks for identity checks are
 common. Ivorians can travel abroad freely and can emigrate
 without discrimination. Ivorians have the right of voluntary
 repatriation. There are no known cases of revocation of
 citizenship. Ivory Coast's refugee and asylum practices are
 
 
 153
 IVORY COAST
 liberal. The country has resettled or granted safe haven to
 Angolans, Burkinabe, Eritreans, Ghanaians, Guineans,
 Liberians, and Vietnamese. While in Ivory Coast, they receive
 one-year renewable resident visas for their first five years
 in the country, after which they may apply for permanent
 resident status. Ivory Coast does not take any significant
 responsibility for the economic and social welfare of refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Political participation in Ivory Coast is limited to the
 Democratic Party of Ivory Coast, which is headed by President
 Houphouet-Boigny. No opposition groups exist openly, and
 their formation is discouraged. Within the party, the
 President operates through a 10-member executive committee, a
 58-member political bureau, and a 206-member steering
 committee. Political power is concentrated in the President's
 hands, and most important decisions are made by the President
 himself. Within this strictly observed one-party system, the
 Ivorian Government continues to encourage more open
 participation in the political process by expanding the size
 of the party institutions noted above and by permitting any
 citizen to contest legislative, municipal, and local party
 elections. In the case of the 1985 legislative elections,
 approximately 577 individuals ran for the 175-seat National
 Assembly. The party played no role in choosing candidates or
 administering the elections. Intense competition took place
 in all three elections in which all citizens were eligible to
 vote. In the municipal elections, 13 of the 33 incumbent
 mayors who sought reelection were defeated, and only 60 out of
 112 incumbents running were reelected to the National
 Assembly. Voter participation in these two elections was
 reported at 45 percent. President Houphouet-Boigny was
 returned to a sixth term in office in an uncontested race. An
 important development in 1985 was an amendment to the Ivorian
 Constitution designating the President of the National
 Assembly as interim successor to the Chief of State should the
 latter become incapacitated.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has been cooperative toward inquiries into its
 human rights situation. Ivory Coast has a chapter of Amnesty
 International. The last inquiry occurred in 1981 and
 concerned a published report by Amnesty International in Paris
 that the Government drafted striking television employees into
 the army as a form of extrajudicial punishment. The
 Government at first maintained that these men were simply
 doing their duty as conscripts. Later, the men appeared in
 uniform on national television and were told they were being
 returned to civilian life. Amnesty International did not
 include an entry on the Ivory Coast in its 1985 report.
 Freedom House terms Ivory Coast "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The population of the Ivory Coast was estimated at 10.1
 million in mid-1985 and is currently growing at an annual rate
 of 4 percent. Approximately three-fourths of that growth
 comes from natural increase and the remaining one-fourth from
 net immigration. Roughly 44 percent of the populace is
 
 
 154
 IVORY COAST
 urban. Per capita gross domestic product (GDP) was $691 in
 1985. More than 2 million foreign Africans, some 100,000
 Lebanese, and over 30,000 French, along with a small number of
 other Europeans, North Americans, and Asians live in Ivory
 Coast.
 Ivory Coast's predominately agricultural economy is one of
 Africa's most prosperous, having grown in real terms at nearly
 7 percent annually until 1982. However, three years of
 recession and negative GDP growth, coupled with government
 austerity measures (e.g., civil service salary freezes and
 reduced perquisites), have substantially reduced both
 purchasing power and the Government's ability to provide
 services that Ivorians had come to expect. Ivory Coast now
 seems on the threshold of recovery. In 1985, it had very good
 harvests in all the important agricultural sectors and enjoyed
 good international prices for coffee and cocoa crops. The
 external debt currently stands at nearly 6 billion dollars and
 will continue to be a constraint on growth through the end of
 the decade.
 A great disparity exists between the standard of living of
 expatriates and African elites and that of the urban poor and
 villagers. Nevertheless, there is a sizable and growing urban
 Ivorian middle class, and village living conditions have
 steadily improved during Ivory Coast's 25 years as an
 independent state. The country has constructed an excellent
 nationwide highway system and nearly all Ivorians have access
 to motorized transportation.
 Life expectancy at birth is 51 years (1985). The current
 estimate of infant mortality is 121 per 1,000 live births.
 The World Bank has estimated that 66 percent of the population
 had access to safe drinking water in 1980 and that the ratio
 of calorie supply available for consumption relative to
 nutritional requirement was 115 in 1985. Ivory Coast has a
 substantial degree of food self-sufficiency and, although
 malnutrition sometimes occurs, it is largely due to
 nutritional ignorance and/or distribution problems rather than
 an overall lack of food.
 The adult literacy rate is 35 percent (1980). Education
 absorbs some 30-40 percent of the operating budget and is
 generally available to all children, Ivorian and foreign, boys
 and girls. At least three years of primary education are
 offered in all but the smallest villages. Primary school
 enrollment, as a percentage of children of primary school age,
 was 76 percent in 1981-1983. Health care, by contrast,
 absorbs only 7 percent of the budget and is less widely
 distributed than educational services. There is no primary
 health care system in place. Health facilities tend to
 emphasize curative rather than preventive medicine, and most
 health care professionals are based in urban areas where
 access to their services is determined largely by the demands
 of the market.
 Ivory Coast is a signatory to and seeks to abide by the U.N.
 conventions on workers' rights and conditions of employment.
 Minimum wage levels and a minimum working age of 16 years of
 age have been established by the Government. The Government
 enforces a comprehensive code of law, code du travail,
 governing the terms and conditions of service for salaried
 workers and providing for occupational safety and health
 standards. Extensive safeguards protect against unjust
 
 
 155
 IVORY COAST
 compensation, excessive hQurs, and capricious discharge from
 one's position. Month-long paid vacations and a substantial
 severance pay are guaranteed. Government medical insurance
 and retirement programs provide an element of income security
 for salaried employees in the modern sector. Urban workers in
 the informal sector and rural workers find conditions quite
 different, and occupational regulations may be underenforced.
 The Government's policy of Ivorianization requires that all
 positions be offered to Ivorians before foreigners; this keeps
 foreign Africans from most wage and salary jobs in the modern
 sector.
 Although males clearly play the preponderant role overall,
 some Ivorian traditional societies accord women considerable
 political and economic power. In rural areas tribal customs
 dictate the division of tasks and these sometimes fall heavily
 on women. Female circumcision continues to be practiced among
 elements of the Ivorian population, although it is rare in
 urban populations. Official party policy is to encourage full
 participation by women in social, economic, and political
 life. The Ministry of Women's Affairs was established in 1976
 for this purpose but recently has remained without a minister
 for an extended period. Women remain lightly represented at
 the higher levels of government and the party. Ten women are
 in the 175-seat National Assembly and 28 women in the
 202-member Democratic Party's steering committee.
