 LAOS
 The Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPDR) is a Communist,
 one-party state. The Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP)
 is the only party and the primary source of political authority
 in the country; the party's leadership imposes broad controls
 on Laos' 4 million people.
 In August 1991, the National Assembly (formerly Supreme
 People's Assembly), driven at least in part by the Government's
 economic reform efforts, adopted a new Constitution. The
 Constitution confers substantial powers on the Assembly and
 provides for many basic freedoms, including free elections of
 National Assembly-members. It also provides the possibility
 for instituting some political reforms. The Constitution is
 silent on the question of allowing competing political parties,
 and it remains to be seen to what extent the human rights and
 political reforms it promises will be realized in practice.
 Also, in keeping with its efforts at economic development and
 legal reform, the Government has made a substantial effort to
 develop a legal system with a codified body of laws dealing
 with contracts, foreign investment, private property, labor,
 family and a penal code. Elections for a new National Assembly
 are expected in 1992.
 The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) remains the main instrument
 of state control. The MOI police monitor Lao society and
 expatriates who live in Laos, and the LPRP also has its own
 system of informants in workplaces and residential
 communities. However, the extent of this monitoring seems to
 be lessening as political change continues.
 In the first few years after the LPDR came to power in 1975, at
 least 350,000 Lao fled the country to escape the Government's
 harsh political and economic policies. Since 1985, the
 Government has abandoned socialist economic policies and
 instituted a series of sweeping economic reforms that have
 changed the country from a centrally planned to a market-
 oriented economy. These reforms have improved the economy,
 which is now dominated by private enterprise.
 There were continued, if limited, improvements in important
 personal freedoms in 1991. Lao nationals enjoyed greater
 freedom of religion and travel, and the expansion of economic
 reforms and cdntacts with the international community created
 an atmosphere more conducive to political discourse. Freedom
 of speech and press, freedom of assembly, the right of privacy,
 and the right of citizens to change their government are absent
 in Laos. To be sure, the new Constitution, with its provisions
 for freedom of worship, freedom of speech, and freedom of the
 press, offers the possibility of moving away from arbitrary use
 of power toward the rule of law.' However, it has yet to be
 tested, and the extent to which citizens will be able to
 practice these freedoms remains to be seen.
 RESPECT )OR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 The small-scale insurgency that has existed since 1975
 continued in 1991, but at a much lower level than in previous
 years. Improved relations between Laos and its neighbors,
 especially Thailand, have eroded foreign support for the Lao
 
 
 908
 LAOS
 insurgency. Most of the insurgents are former Royal Lao Army
 soldiers and Hmong tribesmen, who conduct small-scale military
 operations in Laos, occasionally attacking military and
 civilian vehicles. Insurgents have claimed repeatedly that the
 Lao military employs chemical weapons against them; but
 considerable investigative efforts in recent years have
 revealed no evidence of chemical weapons use. Both sides have
 reportedly used brutal tactics on occasion, with the insurgents
 occasionally assassinating military and local officials and
 ambushing civilian and military vehicles. In early 1991, the
 Vice President of the Kasi coal mining operation in northern
 Vientiane province was assassinated, allegedly by Hmong
 insurgents. Later in the year, a group of eight loggers were
 found brutally murdered north of Vientiane. Hmong insurgents
 also were suspected in this murder. Official policy calls for
 the execution of insurgent leaders, but no such actions were
 taken in 1991.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearances were reported in 1991.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Lao Penal Code prohibits torture or mistreatment of
 prisoners, and the police do not appear to use torture or abuse
 during arrest and detention.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In April the Government released from reeducation camps 24
 detainees who had been held since 1975, and a 25th detainee was
 released in November. The Government still holds at least
 eight detainees--all former Royal Lao Government officials or
 military officers--in Houaphanh Province. The Government
 admits to still holding these eight former officials, but
 maintains they committed crimes while in detention and are now
 common criminals serving fixed terms. There is no evidence
 that these eight prisoners were tried for crimes committed
 while in detention, nor has the Government given specific
 information on the purported crimes. The Government claims
 that all former reeducation camps have been closed and that the
 eight remaining detainees are free to travel in Houaphanh
 Province but not to other provinces. Reportedly, they receive
 mail and financial assistance from outside, and their families
 are free to visit or to stay with them.
 Those accused of hostility to the regime or of what the
 Government calls "socially undesirable habits" such as
 prostitution, drug abuse, and vagrancy are subject to arrest
 and confinement in "rehabilitation" centers, usually without
 public trial. Most of these people have been allowed to return
 to their homes after periods ranging from a few months to
 several years of forced labor, political indoctrination, and
 admission of guilt. The November 1989 Penal Code contains some
 protection for those accused of.crimes, such as a statute of
 limitations and public trials provisions. The Government is
 setting up a system of courts to administer justice publicly
 for the first time since the change of government in 1975. A
 number of foreign lawyers, including some from the United
 States, are assisting the Government in this effort.
 
 
 909
 LAOS
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The National Assembly enacted a criminal code and laws
 establishing a judiciary in November 1989, but these steps have
 been implemented slowly and have not yet made a significant
 difference in the administration of justice. Under the new
 Constitution, judges and prosecutors are independent and their
 decisions are not subject to outside scrutiny. The Government
 provides legal representation to the accused, but almost all
 the practicing lawyers in Laos work for the State.
 People may be arrested on unsupported accusations and without
 being informed of the charges or of the accusers' identities.
 Although regulations call for judgment to be given in public,
 this amounts to a public announcement of the sentence and not a
 true public trial. There is some provision for appeal,
 although there is reportedly no appeal in important political
 cases tried by "people's courts". The Council of Ministers
 must approve death sentences. There were no reports of capital
 sentences in 1991.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 With the recent liberalization of the economy, the Government
 has significantly relaxed most elements of state control,
 including police monitoring of personal and business activities
 and enforcement of the nighttime curfew. In addition, the new
 Constitution prohibits arrests or searches in homes without
 warrants or authorization, though search and seizure continue
 to be authorized by the security bureaus themselves rather than
 by judicial authority. Although there is probably still some
 monitoring of international mail and telephone calls, it is
 much less than in the past'. In addition, the new penal code
 outlaws listening to telephone calls without proper
 authorization. The Government has lifted restrictions on the
 sale of privately owned land and implemented a new law to
 return property confiscated after 1975 to the original owners.
 However, a November 1990 decree provides for the confiscation
 of the property of some 30 officials of the former Government
 who were convicted in absentia in 1975 and are not allowed to
 return to Laos.
 The Government and party continue to monitor some aspects of
 family life through a system of neighborhood and workplace
 committees. The ,neighborhood committees have responsibility
 for maintaining public order in their neighborhood and
 reporting "bad elements" to the police.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a, Freedom of Speech ind Press
 Despite the constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech,
 freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly, the exercise of
 these freedoms is broadly controlled by the Government. In the
 past, the Government has reacted harshly to expressions of
 political dissent. Three officials and former officials
 arrested in October 1990 for reportedly advocating a multiparty
 system for Laos remain under internal exile in Houaphanh
 Province, with no date fixed for a trial and no public access
 to them. The new penal code bars slandering the State,
 including distorting party or state policies, and spreading
 false rumors conducive to disorder. The penal code also bars
 
 
 910
 LAOS
 disseminating books and other materials that are deemed
 indecent or would infringe on the national culture.
 Newspapers and the state radio and television are instruments
 of the Government, reflecting its views. The constitutional
 guarantee of freedom of the press leaves open the possibility
 of nongovernment publications, and at least one privately owned
 publication is now operating in Laos. There are presently
 limitations on what foreign publications may be imported,
 though some Thai and Western newspapers are sold. The
 Government makes no effort to discourage reception of Thai
 radio or television, which are widely watched and listened to
 in the Mekong River valley. The Government is currently
 negotiating with Thai broadcasters to install transmitting
 equipment in the interior of Laos to expand the Lao audience
 for Thai television. In March the Government disbanded all
 videocassette stores for distributing tapes opposing the policy
 of the State and required stores to have permits to distribute
 videocassettes. This decree has had little effect in practice,
 as the number of video stores has actually increased, and
 distributors continue to carry a large selection of tapes.
 Academic freedom is limited, but the new Constitution
 guarantees scholars the right to conduct academic research and
 to associate with academic institutions in other countries.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government controls most large public gatherings and,
 except for religious, athletic, and communal events, organizes
 them. The new penal code expressly prohibits demonstrations or
 protest marches aimed at causing turmoil and social
 instability, prescribing penalties of from I to 5 years'
 imprisonment. Unspecified "destabilizing subversive
 activities" are also banned, with penalties ranging from house
 arrest to death. All associations are party controlled and
 disseminate official policy. The Constitution specifies the
 right of Lao citizens to organize and join associations,
 although presently all professional groups are organized and
 directed by the LPRP.
 Contact between ordinary Lao and foreigners is increasing as
 restrictions, such as the requirement for government approval
 of invitations to most foreigners' homes, are no longer
 enforced and appear changed. The prohibition against
 foreigners staying with Lao families has likewise been eased in
 urban areas, and the Government allows Lao citizens to marry
 foreigners.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Nearly all lowland Lao are Buddhists; most highland Lao are
 animists. In official statements, the Government has
 recognized the right to freedom of religion as well as the
 contributions religion can make to the development of the
 nation. The Constitution contains provisions for religious
 freedom.
 The Government has openly supported Buddhist organizations in
 the last few years. It no longer seeks to subvert religion,
 and even high-level government officials now routinely attend
 Buddhist functions. The Government now tolerates and
 encourages the open practice of religion, and many temples are
 being repaired and restored. The number of Buddhist monks is
 growing, with about 30,000 presently practicing in Laos. Monks
 remain the only social group still entitled to special
 
 
 911
 LAOS
 honorific terms of address, and these are used even by high
 party and.,government officials. Buddhist clergy are
 prominently featured at important state and party functions.
 The Government permits religious festivals without hindrance.
 Links with coreligionists and religious associations in other
 countries require Government approval. The Government does not
 formally ban missionaries from entering Laos to proselytize but
 in practice almost always denies them permission to enter.
 Many resident foreigners are active in Lao churches and provide
 assistance setting up new churches. The Government welcomes
 nongovernmental organizations with religious affiliations as
 long as they contribute to national development and do not
 openly proselytize.
 Roman Catholics and Protestants are permitted to worship
 openly, and new churches have opened since 1990. At least one
 Catholic and two Protestant churches are active in Vientiane,
 with dozens of other churches scattered throughout the country.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Although the Government retains the right to require citizens
 to obtain official permission for internal travel, it has
 relaxed this requirement considerably. Foreign residents in
 Vientiane must obtain permission to travel outside the limits
 of Vientiane Prefecture, though this requirement is not
 strictly enforced. The Government routinely issues
 authorization for foreigners to visit almost all regions of the
 country, often without official escort, to conduct research and
 to work.
 Most Lao may easily obtain government permission and exit
 permits to travel abroad. The function for issuing passports
 and exit permits has been transferred from the Ministry of the
 Interior to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, facilitating
 issuance of travel documents. Border crossing permits for
 Thailand are routinely available for those who can afford the
 modest issuance fee. Travel to the United States and other
 Western countries has risen dramatically in the past several
 years.
 In recent years, the number of Lao emigrating to live with
 relatives abroad has increased sharply, and the Government
 appears not to interfere with persons desiring to emigrate.
 The stated government policy since 1977 has been to welcome
 back the approximately 10 percent of the population who fled
 after the change of governments in 1975. Since 1988, thousands
 of Lao living abroad have returned to visit family and friends,
 and the Government does not restrict the return of these
 people. A number of Lao have returned to investigate business
 possibilities, and several returned Lao-have remained to
 operate businesses. Under the new property code, many returned
 Lao have'successfully petitioned to regain their property.
 Laos has also agreed to take back its citizens who crossed into
 Thailand, mostly to seek refugee status, but who now wish to
 return home. The Government's policy is to return any
 properties that were confiscated, but some who fled Laos are
 excluded from this policy. Since May 1980, when the Government
 reached agreement on a repatriation program with Thailand and
 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),
 nearly 8,000 Lao have voluntarily returned to Laos under UNHCR
 
 
 912
 LAOS
 auspices. Lowland Lao have made up the majority of returnees,
 though many of the 62,000 hilltribe Lao living in refugee camps
 in Thailand have expressed an interest in returning.
 In July 1991, Laos, Thailand, and the UNHCR came to agreement
 on a phased return of the hilltribe Lao remaining in Thailand
 who wish to return to Laos. This agreement includes provisions
 for the careful monitoring of returnees to insure they are
 given the same rights and treatment as resident Lao. Those who
 return are generally given several days of political
 instruction and then sent on, usually to special resettlement
 areas provided by the Government. The UNHCR provides basic
 necessities and is 4iven regular access to them to monitor
 treatment of the returnees and living conditions. According to
 the UNHCR, returnees have not been the subject of
 discrimination, official or otherwise, and are allowed back
 with all the belongings they accumulated while outside of Laos.
 In addition to those repatriated under the UNHCR program, an
 estimated 30,000 people have repatriated themselves without
 official involvement.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Despite constitutional provisions for secret ballots and
 universal suffrage in the public election of National Assembly
 members, in practice citizens do not have the ability to change
 their government. Under the new Constitution, citizens elect
 members of the Assembly, which in turn elects the President.
 Because the LPRP continues to dominate government and politics,
 however, there is no structured way in which citizens could
 remove the LPRP from power.
 The National Assembly, which ratified the Constitution this
 year, was elected by secret ballot in 1989. It included a
 number of legislators who were not members of the LPRP, though
 all candidates had to be approved by the party. Some 121
 candidates ran for a total of 79 seats. No other parties were
 permitted to organize, and voting was mandatory. The
 Government has said it will hold National Assembly elections
 again in 1992.
 The new Constitution provides for basic human rights, including
 freedom of religion, freedom of the press and of speech,
 freedom of assembly, freedom to work, the right to petition the
 Government, and the right to own property. It also provides
 for elections by secret ballot of many important officials.
 The Constitution stipulates the primacy of the LPRP but does
 not specifically prohibit other parties. It remains to be seen
 how these provisions will be applied in practice.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no domestic human rights groups. Any organization
 wishing to investigate and publicly criticize the Government's
 human rights policies would face serious obstacles, if it were
 permitted to operate at all. Laos generally does not cooperate
 with international human rights organizations. The Government
 characterized the "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices
 for 1990" as "the most blatant act of interference in internal
 affairs." It has, however, permitted visits by officials of
 
 
 913
 LAOS
 international humanitarian organizations and has communicated
 with them by letter.
 Sect-ion 5 Discrimination Based bn Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Approximately one-half of the population is ethnic Lao, also
 called "lowland Lao," and the other half a mosaic of hpland
 hilltribes. The Government is attempting to integrate these
 groups through voluntary programs and to overcome traditional
 antagonisms between lowland Lao and minority groups. The new
 Constitution specifically provides for equal rights for all
 minorities, and there is no legal discrimination against them.
 The party and the Government continue to be dominated by
 lowlafd Lao males, though efforts have been made to include
 minorities in the political and governmental elites. Four
 women and-four members of-minorities were elected to the
 55-person Central Committee of the LPRP in April. Ethnic
 minorities occupy many important government positions,
 including that of Minister of Interior.
 The Hmong, the largest highland hilltribe, are split along clan
 lines. During the years of insurgency, many were strongly
 anti-Communist while others sided with the Lao Communists and
 the Vietnamese. The Government has repressed many of those
 groups who fought against it, especially those continuing to
 resist its authority by force. The Hmong tried to defend some
 of their tribal areas after 1975, and some continue to support
 insurgent groups.' Lao armed forces conduct operations against
 armed insurgents, most of whom are Hmong. Many Hmong who
 supported the Lao Communists before 1975 today occupy important
 positions in the Government.
 Traditionally, women in Lao society have been subservient to
 men and often discouraged from obtaining an education. Today,
 the active but government-controlled Lao Women's Federation has
 as one of its stated goals the achievement of equal rights for
 women, and equal rights for women are provided for in the new
 Constitution. The Government claims a higher percentage of
 women are in school now than before 1975 and that women are
 being encouraged to assume a greater role in economic and
 political activity. Women occupy responsible positions in
 government and private business. The 1990 Labor Code offers
 special protection for women and children in the workplace.
 There is no pattern of widespread domestic or culturally
 approved violence against women, but both lowland Lao and
 hilltribes tend to hold women in lower esteem than men.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 An estimated 85 percent of Lao are subsistence farmers. Among
 salaried workers, the majority are employed by the State,
 though this is changing rapidly. In November 1990, the
 Government adopted a Labor Code that permits labor unions to be
 formed in the workplace but does not allow unions outside the
 officially sanctioned single trade union system. The labor
 unions that do exist have no right to strike and are controlled
 by the Federation of Lao Trade Unions (FLTU), which in turn is
 controlled by the LPRP. The FLTU is affiliated with the
 Communist-dominated World Federation of Trade Unions. The
 extent to which the FLTU is free to affiliate internationally
 with other organizations is unknown.
 
 
 914
 LAOS
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no right to organize and bargain collectively, but the
 new Labor Code tipulates that disputes must be resolved
 through the formation of a committee in the workplace composed
 of employees and representatives of the local labor union, as
 well as representatives of the FLTU. Wages and salaries for
 government employees are set by the Government, while wages and
 salaries for private business employees are set by management.
 Most salaried employees work for the State. There are no
 export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced Compulsory Labor
 The 1990 Labor Code prohibits forced labor except in time of
 war or national disaster, when the State may conscript
 laborers. Prisoners in prison camps are expected to do manual
 labor, including growing their own food. In addition, there
 are reports that some of these prisoners, when released, are
 restricted to the general area of the camp and expected to work
 there on state enterprises.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Under the 1990 Labor Code, children under 15 may not be
 recruited for labor. Because many children younger than this
 help their families on farms or in shops, the Labor Code allows
 for younger children to work for their families, provided that
 they are not engaged in dangerous or difficult work.
 Employment of children in Laos' small but growing industrial
 sector is not widespread, although it is common in urban
 shops. The Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Justice ?re
 responsible for enforcing these provisions, but enforcement is
 problematical becaue of the country's lack of resources.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Laos is one of the world's poorest and least developed
 countries. No minimum wage exists, but the 1990 Labor Code has
 a provision for establishing one which is expected to be
 implemented in 1992.
 The Labor Code guarantees workers a broad range of
 entitlements, including a workweek limited to 48 hours (36 in
 dangerous activities) and safe working conditions. A worker
 may not be fired without cause.
 Workplace conditions are not systematically exploitative but
 often fail to protect workers adequately against sickness or
 accident. The Labor Code requires employers to provide a safe
 work environment for employees, and offers special compensation
 for workers engaged in dangerous work. An employer must
 provide all expenses for a worker injured or killed while at
 work. The Government has established health and safety
 standards for workplaces but in practice has no mechanism to
 insure compliance with these standards.
