 BANGLADESH
 Bangladesh, a predominantly agricultural nation, is the world's
 most over-populated and impoverished large country. Since it
 won independence from Pakistan in a 1971 war, it has been
 plagued by low administrative and governmental capacity,
 political instability, endemic corruption, insufficient
 capital, rapid population growth, and vulnerability to natural
 disaster. Although conditions have improved marginally since
 the first years of independence, the real possibility of major
 famine due to civil anarchy or natural disaster continues to
 haunt Bangladesh and influence the conduct of its leaders.
 Bangladesh has, since its independence, alternated between
 civil and military rule. Some members of its elite have
 endeavored to establish a democratically elected form of
 government by framing and revising a constitution and
 experimenting with various forms of parliamentary and
 presidential systems. Its first two popularly chosen
 presidents, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Ziaur Rahman, were,
 however, assassinated in office (in 1975 and 1981
 respectively). The country is presently under martial law.
 The fact that Bangladesh has spent six of its eleven years
 since independence under martial law reflects the weakness of
 its political institutions, the staggering magnitude of its
 economic problems, and a belief among the military that they
 should share authority and responsibility for the affairs of
 the state.
 President Zia was assassinated on May 30, 1981, by a small
 group of dissident army officers. The constitutional machinery
 which he had put in place sustained the transition of power and
 provided for a fair presidential election in November 1982.
 However, the Government of President Abdus Sattar, in whose
 assumption of power the military acquiesced, was unable to
 develop other bases of support or to reach agreement with armed
 forces leaders on a sharing of power and responsibility. On
 March 24, 1982, in a bloodless coup, the commanders of
 Bangladesh's armed forces declared martial law with the
 principal stated goal of cleansing the Government of allegedly
 deeply pervasive corruption. The Constitution was suspended;
 political activity was banned, and stiff penalties for
 criticism of martial law were announced. Rules providing for
 arrest without charge, trial in camera, and the supremacy of
 newly created martial law courts were put into effect.
 Furthermore, martial law court decisions were not subject to
 appeal. The martial law declarations and regulations abrogated
 in effect all individual political and legal rights.
 Despite the draconian powers which it has assigned itself, the
 martial law Government of senior generals has so far proved
 relatively restrained in its actions. Approximately three
 dozen politicians, leading government officials, and
 businessmen have been arrested in the capital city of Dacca,
 almost entirely on charges of some form of corruption. There
 have been very few directly political arrests. To date, a
 total of fourteen such prominent persons have been convicted.
 
 
 1098
 Some.persons are still awaiting trial, while others have been
 .cleared and released or released on bail. According to well
 informed local observers, arrests in the outlying districts,
 mostly on charges of corruption, total about 1,000.
 While the people have largely been deprived of their political
 rights, large-scale violations of the integrity of the.person
 have not occurred. Although the brusqueness of the military
 has intimidated or offended many Bangladeshis, the martial law
 Government is largely free from-substantiated-charges of
 abuse.: Nonetheless, no independent law or legal structure
 restrains the military from much more repressive methods.
 The current martial law leadership has, however,- spoken of its
 intention to -arry out a progressive return-to representative
 procedures.
 1.-.Respect for the.Integrity-of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 Although there have been incidents of political violence,
 -ki4ling"for political motives is not widespread in Bangladesh.
 However,-as noted-above, .two of Bangladesh's.popularly chosen
 Vresidentswara assassinated in office.
 b. Disappearance
 Some persons accused of crimes against-the state (such as
 corruption or abuse of office) as well as some prospective
 witnesses in such cases were arrested and held without notice
 during the- first few months of martial law. It is uncertain
 how many such persons are still under detention, but the
 martial law authorities have given indications that families
 wilLbe notified of arrests and.the whereabouts of prisoners
 within 24 hours.
 c-. -Torture
 A few-unconfirmed allegations of torture have surfaced, but no
 evidence of the systematic or widespread use of such practices
 in Bangladesh-exists, and there are no indications that the
 Martial Law-Administration-approves of them.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Bangladesh jails reflect the poor living standards prevailing
 in the country .in general. The martial law Government has
 recently announced a decision to reform the prison system,
 beginning with an-upgrading of physical facilities and with the
 eventual goal of reorienting-prison administration from penal
 to correctional. However, no changes have yet been implemented.
 Prominent individuals who have been jailed said that, although
 uncomfortable, they were not mistreated. There are reports
 that prospective-witnesses in martial law cases have been
 detained incommunicado and without charge in order to elicit
 testimony against others. Punishments for offenses against
 
 
 1099
 martial law regulations range from fines to death. The death
 penalty may be imposed for such crimes as interferefice with the
 defense services, major corruption or criminal misconduct by
 public officials, illegal possession of arms or explosives,
 arson, and smuggling. However, there have been no known
 summary executions under martial law nor has anyone convicted
 of a crime received the death penalty with the exception of one
 murderer. Published sentences, which have been stiff in cases
 of large-scale corruption, have included imprisonment, fines,
 and confiscation of properties. Although the Martial Law
 Administration, as observed in Dacca, has been relatively
 restrained, reliable information is not available on the rigor
 and possible arbitrariness with which authorities in the
 outlying areas may be exercising their powers.
 e. Arbitary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Martial law regulations authorize arrest for reasonable
 suspicion of having committed an offense under the regulations
 (such as criticizing martial law, creating panic, engaging in
 political activity, corruption, or smuggling). The suspect may
 be detained for thirty days before a report must be filed and
 may be held indefinitely upon the signature of the Chief
 Martial Law Administrator. Charges may be made without
 investigation if the inquiring officer believes there are
 reasonable grounds for suspicion, and the right.of habeas
 corpus has been suspended.
 In practice, the martial law authorities have concentrated on
 arresting present and former government officials, politicians,
 and businessmen suspected of corruption and have kept them
 jailed while investigating and gathering evidence. Largely
 from information available in the press, it is estimated that
 about three dozen such persons from the Dacca area are
 currently under arrest. Fourteen others have already been
 tried and sentenced, while two have been released and about a
 dozen are free on bail. After the first wave of arrests in the
 early months of martial law, there followed a lull until
 October when a group of eleven senior lawyers were detained for
 ten days for opposition to court decentralization. Two
 prominent political leaders were arrested in November on
 corruption charges, although many believe they were jailed
 because they had resumed political activity. Local observers
 estimate that throughout. the country approximately 1,000 less
 prominent people are being held under the martial law
 regulations, almost all on suspicion of corruption. A very
 small minority of the arrests are due to political affiliation
 or overt opposition to the regime. In the last months of the
 year, following two confrontations between opposition groups
 and the Martial Law Administration, the military authorities
 quickly released senior lawyers and students arrested for
 oppositional activities. However, several months earlier,
 three students arrested for putting up political posters were
 given seven-year sentences.
 The Special Powers Act of 1974 remains in effect. Under this
 act persons may be detained without charge for 24 hours, held
 with the consent of a magistrate for 30 days, and held
 indefinitely with the approval of the Government. The martial
 
 
 1100
 law authorities have made a few arrests on the basis of this
 act. In one case, they arrested and held for four months a
 politician against whom there were no charges under martial law
 regulations.
 On March 25, 1982, on the occasion of Independence Day, 65
 persons detained by the former Government under the Special
 Powers Act were released by the martial law authorities.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Most civil and criminal cases still come to regular civilian
 courts with public trial and the right to counsel. These
 courts appear to be functioning normally, and the martial law
 courts themselves follow in principle the British-originated
 Evidence Act and Criminal Procedures Code. However, the
 continued existence-of separate martial law courts may make it
 difficult to maintain the authority and morale of the civilian
 legal system.
 Through the suspension of the Constitution and the-promulgation
 -of-martial law regulations, the-Martial Law Administration
 suspended the rights of the public to bring writs of any kind
 against the Government. In addition to blocking habeas corpus
 and the possibility ofiraising constitutional questions through
 the judicial system, this action has severely affected the
 normal administration of civil justice, especially impeding the
 settlement of property disputes and blocking normal procedures
 for the redress of large and small grievances against the
 Government.
 From'printed government sources, it is .estimated that, as of
 August.1982, about 700 pending cases had been transferred from
 civilian to martial law courts. In many instances these cases
 deal with corruption-charges. Some may have been transferred
 due to. personal or political vendettas. Martial law
 regulations permit trial in camera,.exclude defense lawyers
 .from" certain martial law courts, deny appeal rights, and allow
 the. Chief Martial Law Administrator to revise judgments and
 sentences. However, in prominent-cases, the Martial Law
 1-Administration has allowed the participation of witnesses and
 defense lawyers... Reporters.have covered martial law court
 trials , although their reporting is very scanty and subject to
 self-cenaorship. From the public, only relatives or close
 associates-have.been allowed to attend trials, and some defense
 -lawyers have reported difficulties in gaining access to their
 clients.
 Due'to the military's overriding powers, trials of persons
 by martial law courts are proceeding in an atmosphere which
 cannot be.characterized as full, fair, and public. However,
 .the conduct of the.military_-courts has thus far been
 restrained. In addition, owing.to congestion in the court
 system.attributable to a lack of magistrates and to intricate
 procedural requirements, many ordinary prisoners remain in jail
 awaiting trial for excessive periods of time. Delays of from
 .two to five years are not rare.
 In August 1982, the Government announced new judicial and
 
 

1101
 police procedures designed to expedite law enforcement and
 justice. These changes broaden the powers of the police and
 lower courts, limit appeal rights, and curtail the amount of
 time allowed for the investigation and disposition of minor
 cases. While these procedures may speed up case handling, some
 Bangladeshi lawyers fear that the administration of justice
 will deteriorate due to difficulties in investigation and
 testimony which will arise under such time constraints. This
 would be a risk, especially in a country like Bangladesh where
 communication is difficult and where partially trained
 primary-level jurists are given expanded powers and
 responsibilities without expanded resources. As one element Qf
 its reorganization of the judiciary, the Martial Law
 Administration has decentralized the appellate judiciary,
 previously resident only in Dacca. Benches of the high court
 will now also sit in six principal towns outside the capital.
 While martial iw authorities state that the purpose of this
 decentralization is to bring justice closer to the public, many
 judges and lawyers assert that this change will damage the
 ability of the court to function.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Bangladesh authorities do not normally engage in arbitrary
 invasion of the home. A judicial warrant is required before
 authorities enter a home, and courts require that there be a
 reasonable basis of suspicion of involvement in a crime before.
 issuing such a warrant. The martial law regulations provide
 for entry and search of the home under the same set of
 conditions as stated above but extend these powers to military
 as well as police authorities.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of the Press
 The Bangladesh news media practice self-censorship by avoiding
 explicit mention of topics about which the Martial Law
 Administration is particularly sensitive. The Government owns
 and operates the radio and television facilities and owns and
 controls two of the three English-language dailies. Many
 Bengali-language daily and weekly papers are privately owned.
 These non-government newspapers enjoyed the support of various
 political parties and, until the declaration of martial law in
 March 1982, they reflected various political views. They
 continue to do so but in a muted fashion.
 Although few overt actions have been taken against the media,
 martial law regulations prohibit criticism of martial law,
 spreading of prejudicial reports, inciting panic or fear, or
 creating disaffection within the defense services. Penalities
 range from fines to death, but no known executions have taken
 place under these regulations. Immediately following the
 imposition of martial law (in one of two arrest incidents to
 date involving journalists), an editor was sentenced to two
 years imprisonment for publication of an article critical of
 martial law. He was freed after serving five months. In the
 fall of 1982, a second editor was detained and then released on
 
 
 1102
 bail pending trail.
 The Government may ban foreign or domestic publications. There
 were six such incidents in 1982. Citing the Special Powers
 Act, the martial law authorities have banned the publication of
 two Bengali weeklies because of articles which the regime
 found politically unacceptable. Four issues of foreign
 magazines were banned due to the publication of articles deemed
 politically sensitive or which were feared to "incite hatred
 and enmity" or "outrage the religious feelings" of the populace.
 No overt actions have been taken against academic freedom.
 However academics are subject to the same set of martial law
 restrictions as other Bangladeshis, and many university people
 feel intimidated by the military authorities. Reportedly a
 policy change-is under consideration to make professors subject
 to transfer among regional universities, a move which the
 professors consider a threat to their autonomy.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Under martial law regulations, meetings of a political nature
 are banned, as are gatherings of over 100 persons, with the
 exception of cultural, literary, and religious events which are
 permitted and continue to be held.
 The labor union-movement in Bangladesh is very small (about
 three percent of the 33 million working force is unionized).
 Although there are exceptions, labor unions have predominantly
 acted as fronts for political parties. Organized around a core
 of leaders, labor unions have generally shown little effective
 activism on behalf of workers' issues before or after martial
 law. Under the newly instituted Industrial Relations Ordinance
 (1982), strikes and lockouts are prohibited as are union
 meetings without government consent. However, provision is
 made for peaceful settlement of industrial disputes by
 negotiation, followed by binding arbitration and referral to a
 labor court. Wage disputes are sometimes referred to wage
 boards. Labor complaints have been entertained by martial law
 authorities, and the International Labor Organization notes no
 specific concerns at this time.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The'o'verwhelming majority of the population of Bangladesh
 is Muslim. Wliile conversion from one religion to another is
 permitted, proselytizing is not, and concerns have been voiced
 over the conversion of Muslims to Christianity. Present and
 preceding Governments in Bangladesh have often stated to Hindu,
 Buddhist, and Christian minorities (totalling approximately
 ten percent of the population) that national policy provides
 for equality of treatment and freedom of worship for all
 groups. Although this policy is substantialy followed, the
 predominance of the Muslim population and the history of
 communal issues embedded in South Asian history have
 contributed to resentments which handicap members of minority
 religious groups in their access to government positions and
 political influence. Members of some minorities, principally
 Hindus, have a history of serious difficulties in retaining
 
 
 1103
 their properties as a result of Bangladesh's vested property
 laws. These laws, which provide that property belonging to
 persons who left Bangladesh between 1965 and 1971 shall be
 managed by the Government, have in certain cases been misused
 by unscrupulous officials to divest members of minority groups
 of their property.
 An insurgent movement continues among the approximately 500,000
 mostly Buddhist tribal people who inhabit the Chittagong Hill
 Tracts district of Bangladesh. Their principal grievances are
 the Government's claim to land which the indigenous people
 regard as tribal property, and a government program of
 resettling landless ethnic Bengalis from other areas into the
 hill tracts.
 A simmering, low-level state of guerrilla warfare has persisted
 in these areas, largely due to the presence there of over
 10,000 resettled ethnic Bengalis. Clashes between police,
 army, and border patrol units on the one hand, and tribal
 insurgents on the other, have taken place from time to time.
 The number of deaths is believed to be low, although reliable
 statistics are not available. The Government has stated that
 it tries to ensure that troops engaged in counter-insurgency
 operations act in a disciplined manner. It has also responded
 to the tribal grievances by seeking negotiated solutions of
 tribal problems and by increasing the number of development
 projects in the district.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Bangladesh citizqns are free to move within the country.
 However, under the Special Powers Act, the Government has
 designated "protected areas" in border regions and certain
 other locations from which all non-residents may be banned.
 Bangladeshis regarded as "loyal citizens" are free to visit or
 emigrate abroad, subject to foreign exchange controls. Civil
 servants must obtain no-objection certificates from the
 Government, and Bangladeshis going overseas for work (largely
 to the Middle East) must register with the ministry responsible
 for manpower exports. In 1982, the martial law government
 introduced a new emigration ordinance designed to protect
 Bangladesh citizens from victimization by unscrupulous labor
 recruiters.
 Intending emigrants face no official harassment. The right to
 repatriation is observed in Bangladesh. Although the
 Government has no stated policy on refugee and asylum matters,
 in two instances in 1978 and 1979 it provided temporary asylum
 and maintenance to sizeable groups of Arakanese Muslim refugees
 until they could be repatriated safely and voluntarily to Burma.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Since March 24, 1982, a martial law administration led by the
 former Chief of Army Staff, now Commander in Chief, Lieutenant
 General H. M. Ershad, has governed Bangladesh. The Martial Law
 Declaration of March 25 suspended the Constitution and its
 electoral provisions, banned political activities (although not
 
 
 1104
 the existence of political parties), dissolved the Parliament,
 and dismissed the elected President. Martial law authorities
 have stated their intention to return eventually to democratic
 processes but have :set no firm timetable for this. The
 Government has initiated a program of administrative
 decentralization aimed at bringing its services more directly
 to the people and has announced that local thana (police zonal)
 elections will probably take place in late 1983.
 Approximately 250,000 non-Bengali Muslims, known as Biharis,
 experience the problems of statelessness in Bangladesh. After
 the 1971 war of independence, these persons expressed a desire
 to retain Pakistani citizenship. Bangladesh holds that the
 Biharis who opted for Pakistan are Pakistani citizens.
 Pakistan does not accept this claim but did allow 4,500 such
 persons to travel to Pakistan for resettlement in 1982. Mostly
 housed in camps, members of this Bihari community are free to
 come-and go at will, to seek employment, and to conduct other
 normal activities. Other Biharis, who did not opt for
 Pakistan, are treated as citizens of Bangladesh and are able to
 enjoy the same rights as the Bengali majority of the
 population. Some Biharis have faced loss of their properties
 as a result of laws confiscating.Pakistani holdings.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 Government Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights:
 The Bangladesh.Government has allowed independent outside
 investigations of alleged human rights violations. A number of
 international non-governmental human rights organizations,
 including Amnesty International, the International League for
 Human Rights, and the International Commission of Jurists are
 xepresented in-Bangladesh, but no external missions from these
 ,-or. other human rights organizations have come to Bangladesh for
 inquiries since the declaration of martial law, nor have such
 .organizations taken any actions concerning the martial law
 .government.. Several organizations based in Bangladesh (as well
 as individual.1awyers) are active in defending and promoting
 human rights. They-do-so through publicity designed to inform
 people of :their rights,, though provision of legal aid to the
 poor, and through challenges in.the courts to government rules
 and actions. In 1982, one of Bangladesh's senior judges served
 as Chairman of the UN Subcommission on the Prevention of
 Discrimination and Protection of Minorities. In its 1982
 report, Amnesty International stated its concern about martial
 law courts, political prisoners, and reported human rights
 violations in the Chittagong Hill Tracts.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The vast majority of Bangladesh's population is unable to
 obtain adequate amounts of the basic necessities of life.
 Sixty percent of the population is estimated to subsist below
 the absolute poverty level. The self-assigned central task of
 the Government of.Bangladesh is :economic development. Beyond
 extirpating corruption, the stated aims of-the present .martial
 law Government are to involve the entire population in economic
 advancement, with emphasis on food self-sufficiency, population
 
 
 1105
 control, administrative decentralization, and private-sector
 industrial development. However, economic progress is impeded
 by social factors such as a population growth rate of 2.5
 percent per annum, by continuing political uncertainty, and by
 economic handicaps such as a lack of natural resources, a low
 agricultural and industrial base, limited infrastructure, and
 the rudimentary technological level of capital and human
 assets. Per capita annual income in recent years has grown
 slowly and is now estimated at *130. Preliminary figures
 indicate that in the year through June 1982, there was a
 considerable decline in economic growth as Bangladesh's terms
 of trade continued to deteriorate and real aid levels
 declined. This trend is expected to continue.
 Bangladesh's industrial and service sectors are small,
 employing only about 14 percent of the labor force and
 contributing only about 8.4 percent to the GDP. There are no
 accurate measurements of unemployment and underemployment, but
 both are pervasive. Conservative estimates put a total of 30
 percent of the work force in these categories. Recently the
 martial law Government announced major industrial and tax
 policy reforms aimed at strengthening the private sector and
 reducing governmental control over industries, with the purpose
 of encouraging the growth of a competitive industrial sector.
 It has also initiated major policy shifts aimed at reducing or
 eliminating subsidies within the economy.
 In an area approximately the size of Wisconsin, 95 million
 people subsist in a largely peasant-based agricultural economy,
 and 87 percent of them inhabit rural areas. The agricultural
 sector, which accounts for approximately 70 percent of
 employment and 53 percent of the GDP, has shown slow growth.
 Factors such as level delta land, heavy rainfall, and a climate
 permitting year-round cropping favor an agricultural economy.
 However, the country's dependence on monsoon rains and
 primitive farming methods means that a tropical storm or a few
 weeks' variation in rainfall patterns can change subsistence
 into famine. In addition, the small average farm size (about
 two acres), a land-holding system under which a significant
 percentage of the land is sharecropped, and fragmented holdings
 present major obstacles to increased productivity. As a
 result, Bangladesh cannot meet its own food needs.
 Although one half of the rural population is effectively
 landless, lack of trained personnel, poor transportation and
 communications, and the market advantages of the cities have
 discouraged industries from locating in the rural areas. The
 Government has yet to find solutions to the massive problem of
 rural unemployment and underemployment. The high population
 growth rate of 2.5 percent per annum has absorbed food
 production gains.
 The Bangladesh Government committed about 5.9 percent of its
 annual budget to education in FY 81-82. Although government
 policy supports primary, technical, and secondary education for
 the masses, broad-based modern education is far from being a
 reality due to financial and personnel constraints as well as
 to difficulties in the design of the educational system.
 Primary school enrollment figures have shown gains from 36
 
 
 1106
 percent in 1973 to 64-percent in 1979, the latest figures
 available. The Government supports a system of higher
 education which accommodates approximately 300,000 high school
 and 30,000 university students. Adult literacy amounts to only
 &6 percent. The fact that females are outnumbered by about
 fiva-to one in school attendance and that female literacy is
 Abouo4a percent that.of males further .contributes to the low
 sstatusivand restricted choices for -women-in.Bangladesh society.
 Present: beliefs and underlying social barriers circumscribing
 the participation of women in activities beyond the home are
 strongly entrenched and show few signs of weakening. For the
 90 percent of Bangladeshi women who live in rural areas, early
 marriage, high child-bearing rates, and long hours of household
 labor leave little time for non-family interests or outside
 employment. Even in urban areas and among the well-to-do,
 social custom locks women into a protective system which makes
 them economically dependent on their spouses and other male
 relatives.
 Although the present Government publicly supports a progressive
 role for women, little actual progress can be seen. Only a
 small number of the 10 percent of government jobs set aside for
 women have been filled. The overwhelming majority of women
 continue to have little control or choice in their personal
 economic lives.
 The impoverished state of Bangladesh is further evidenced in
 the country's poor health and nutritional standards. Health
 and nutritional programs claim about 3.7 percent of the
 government budget. On a per capita basis, the nutritional
 intake amounts to only 1,870 calories per day, a figure which
 shows a downward trend over the last 14 years (from 2,000 in
 1968). This caloric intake falls far below the UN Food and
 Agriculture Organization's recommended daily minimum of 2,310.
 life expectancy at birth is 46.3 years, and infant mortality
 -accounts for 139 deaths per 1,000 live births. It is estimated
 that there are only 7,000 doctors to treat the population of 95
 million and that only 56 percent of the population has access
 to safe water.
