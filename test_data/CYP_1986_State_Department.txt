 CYPRUS
 Cyprus has been divided since the Turkish military
 intervention of 1974, an event which followed a coup d'etat
 directed from Greece. Since that time, the southern part of
 the country has been under the control of the Government of
 the Republic of Cyprus, and the northern part under an
 autonomous Turkish Cypriot administration supported by the
 presence of Turkish troops. In 1983, this administration
 proclaimed itself the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus,"
 which has been recognized only by Turkey. It held a
 constitutional referendum and presidential and legislative
 elections in 1985.
 The political systems of the Republic of Cyprus and the
 Turkish Cypriot administration are democratic and based on
 free elections, and they guarantee basic human rights to their
 populations in theory and practice.
 Both Cypriot economies are founded on the free enterprise
 system, with stress on private initiative and the right to own
 property. The relatively prospering economy in the south is
 based cn manufacturing, trade, tourism and services,
 construction, and agriculture. The economy in the Turkish
 Cypriot area, which is closely linked to that of Turkey, is
 heavily based on agriculture and has problems with high
 inflation, low investment, and significant underemployment.
 In the past, the Turkish Cypriot economy has provided a far
 greater role for state enterprises, although efforts are now
 under way to orient the economy more towards the private
 sector.
 The conflict between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities
 during the 1963-74 period, the Turkish intervention in 1974,
 and the ensuing presence of Turkish troops in the north have
 led to continuing charges of human rights violations. These
 events resulted in the uprooting of Greek Cypriots and Turkish
 Cypriots from the northern and southern parts of the island
 respectively and the loss of lives, homes, and livelihoods.
 Greek Cypriots point to these displacements, the continuing
 Turkish troop presence, Greek Cypriots missing as a result of
 the 1974 events, and Turkish Cypriot unwillingness to allow
 Greek Cypriot resettlement and travel in the north as the
 fundamental human rights questions in Cyprus today. In
 contrast, Turkish Cypriots assert the 1974 intervention was
 legal and necessary to save their community from destruction.
 They also raise as issues the experience of the Turkish
 Cypriot population living in enclaves from 1963 to IT74 and
 the disappearance of Turkish Cypriots during the same period.
 The subsequent regrouping of the two communities in separate
 parts of the island, according to Turkish Cypriots, was
 necessary for their security.
 In August 1984, the United Nations Secretary General launched
 an initiative to achieve a just and lasting resolution of the
 Cyprus problem. His efforts continued throughout 1986.
 Neither Turkish nor Greek mainland forces deployed on Cyprus
 play an internal security role.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of persons abducted, secretly arrested,
 or held in clandestine detention. However, the issue of
 persons missing during the 1963-74 period remains a source of
 dispute between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot
 communities. The tripartite Committee on Missing Persons
 established under the auspices of the U.N. Secretary General
 in 1981 continued its investigations in 1986.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Both the Cyprus Constitution and the basic document governing
 the Turkish Cypriot community specifically prohibit torture.
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice in
 both communities. Adequate health care is provided in prison
 and detention facilities, and diet is considered normal.
 Family members may visit those in detention. After
 sentencing, prisoners may be visited once a month, or more
 frequently where humanitarian needs exist. Attorneys may
 visit prisoners freely.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention is guaranteed by
 law and respected in practice by the Government of Cyprus and
 Turkish Cypriot authorities. Preventive detention iE. not
 legally authorized, nor has it been reported in pzactice. No
 one may be held for more than 3 days for investigation of a
 crime without referral of the case to the courts for extension
 of the period of detention. Most periods of investigative
 detention do not exceed 8 or 10 days before formal charges are
 filed. No instance of exile was reported.
 No complaints of forced or compulsory labor were reported.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In both parts of Cyprus, fair public trial is guaranteed by
 law. The judiciary is independent of executive or military
 control. Defendants have the right to be represented by
 counsel (at government expense for those who cannot afford
 one), to confront witnesses, and to present evidence in their
 own defense. Cases are generally tried before a judge or
 panel of judges, although a request for a jury trial is
 usually granted. There are no special courts to deal with
 security or political offenses. Civilians are not tried by
 military courts. There are no political prisoners in Cyprus.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Both the Cyprus Constitution and the basic document governing
 the Turkish Cypriot community provide guarantees protecting
 
 
 883
 CYPRUS
 the individual against arbitrary interference. A judicial
 warrant is required, for example, for a police official to
 enter a private residence. Abuses of privacy run counter to
 the democratic traditions of both communities. However,
 Turkish Cypriots complain that mail coming through the
 Republic of Cyprus postal system is often delayed, opened, or
 not delivered.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These rights are guaranteed by law and are widely and freely
 practiced throughout the island. The press is free and
 represents the entire political spectrum. Opposition papers
 frequently criticize the authorities. There is no press
 censorship. The authorities control radio and television.
 Legislation was passed in the Republic of Cyprus in 1986
 giving each party represented in Parliament a seat on the
 board controlling the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation. In
 addition, the proliferation of party and independent
 newspapers in both communities enables ideas and arguments to
 circulate freely.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and kssociation
 The freedom to associate, organize, and hold meetings is
 guaranteed in law and respected in practice. Trade unions and
 confederations, both non-Communist and Communist, are free to
 organize on both sides of the line which divides the two
 communities. Over 80 percent of Greek Cypriot workers and 50
 percent of Turkish Cypriot workers belong to independent trade
 unions. Most unions are affiliated with either the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions or the World
 Federation of Trade Unions. Labor authorities are required by
 law to mediate disputes in cases which cannot be solved
 through normal collective bargaining. All Cypriot workers are
 permitted to strike, although both the Government of Cyprus
 and the Turkish Cypriot authorities have the poweu to curtail
 strikes in what are deemed to be essential services. Each has
 used it once in 1986, in relation to striking port authority
 workers in the south and petroleum sector workers in the north.
 Unions in both parts of Cyprus freely take part in
 international meetings. The Government of Cyprus has taken a
 particularly active role in the International Labor
 Organization. Labor unions, more than most other
 organizations on Cyprus, attempt to maintain contact and
 cooperation across the dividing line.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is respected in Cyprus. In the south, the
 vast majority of the population is Greek Orthodox; in the
 north, Sunni Muslim. The Greek Orthodox Church in the south
 has the character of a state institution. Missionaries are
 allowed to proselytize in both communities.
 Since the law does not accord conscientious objector status to
 any individual or group, there have been arrests, military
 trials, and imprisonments of Greek Cypriot Jehovah's Witnesses
 for their refusal of military service. Those who were
 convicted and imprisoned by the military courts, including
 some Jehovah's Witnesses, were subsequently released on
 constitutional grounds.
 
 
 884
 CYPRUS
 Although members of the Latin, Maronite, and Armenian
 minorities cannot serve in the Greek Cypriot National Guard,
 this exemption is based on ethnic rather than religious
 considerations and is generally welcomed by the minorities
 themselves.
 Approximately 100 Turkish Cypriots still live in the south of
 the island, and they are allowed to practice their religion
 freely. In the north, non-Muslims include over 700 Greek
 Cypriots, over 300 Christian Maronites, and foreign residents
 --all of whom are free to practice their religion.
 Nevertheless, there have been complaints that the welfare of
 minorities in the north is impaired by Turkish Cypriot
 restrictions on housing, water, education, and movement. The
 United Nations Force in Cyprus monitors the welfare of the
 Greek Cypriots and Maronites in the north as well as that of
 the Turkish Cypriots in the south.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots enjoy general freedom of
 movement within their respective areas. Turkish Cypriot
 authorities regulate travel into or out of the Turkish Cypriot
 area. They bar Greeks and Greek Cypriots from entering the
 north and Turkish Cypriots from visiting the south, except
 when traveling for humanitarian, medical, or other special
 reasons. The applications of Greek Cypriot residents of
 enclaves to visit the south are usually granted, but the
 applicants must return within a designated period or risk
 losing their right to return and their property. Foreigners
 coming from the south must obtain permission to enter the
 north. At the same time, the Government of Cyprus bars the
 entry into the Greek Cypriot area of foreigners who arrive at
 Turkish Cypriot ports. Those who enter through the south but
 wish to stay overnight in the north are discouraged from doing
 so by the Government.
 The right to travel abroad and to emigrate is obssrved,
 although individuals facing military service or legal action
 in either part of Cyprus may not be allowed to travel.
 Turkish Cypriots have difficulty in traveling to some
 countries because their travel documents, issued by the
 Turkish Cypriot authorities, are not recognized. Citizens may
 repatriate freely.
 Refugees who come to Cyprus from Eastern Europe are ncrmally
 sent to third countries as soon as arrangements for their
 resettlement can be made.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Both the Government of Cyprus and the administration of the
 Turkish Cypriot community are democratically elected. In
 their lively multiparty political systems, parties compete
 actively and without restriction for popular support. Greek
 Cypriots and Maronites living in the north--the latter having
 chosen before 1960 to be regarded as members of the Greek
 Cypriot community--do not participate in Turkish Cypriot
 elections but elect their own village officials. They are
 eligible to vote in Greek Cypriot elections but must make
 their way to the south in order to exercise their right.
 
 
 885
 CYPRUS
 Women are by custom less active in politics than men in both
 north and south. No woman in the north and only one in the
 south is a member of Parliament, nor are there currently any
 women of ministerial rank in the north. In recent local
 elections in the south, however, 31 out of 228 city council
 seats went to women. A woman serves as Attorney General in
 the Government of Cyprus, and the Government named a woman to
 the bench for the first time in 1986. Two women currently
 serve as under secretaries in the Turkish Cypriot
 administration. There has been a woman judge serving in the
 Turkish Cypriot administration since 1981.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The question of human rights in Cyprus is closely connected to
 the political differences that divide the two communities. In
 1986, a group of Greek Cypriots announced the formation of a
 "Committee for the Restoration of Human Rights Throughout
 Cyprus." This committee ascribes the problem of human rights
 on the i3land to the 1974 Turkish military intervention and
 the continued presence of Turkish troops in the north. The
 Turkish Cypriot Human Rights Committee in turn denounced the
 Greek Cypriot charges, stating that the Turkish troops were
 present to protect Turkish Cypriot human rights.
 Cyprus participates actively in the work of the U.N.
 Commission on Human Rights. For several years, the question
 of human rights in Cyprus relating to the events of 1974 has
 been on the Commission's agenda but has been regularly
 postponed by agreement of the parties directly concerned. The
 Republic of Cyprus also has applied to have this human rights
 question placed on the agenda of the European Commission on
 Human Rights. In addition, the Government of Cyprus has
 repeatedly raised the question of missing persons unaccounted
 for since 1974. Representatives of international human rights
 organizations have open access to both the south and the north.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Food, shelter, education, and health care are available to
 members of both communities regardless of race, religion,
 ethnic background, or political opinion. Both societies are
 essentially middle class, with a small but prominent wealthy
 segment. Housing is adequate and is available for displaced
 persons. Most Cypriots, both Greek and Turkish, are covered
 by national health service systems.
 Throughout Cyprus, women generally have the same legal status
 as men. In the north, legal provisions exist requiring equal
 pay for men and women performing the same job. In the south,
 government workers receive equal pay for equal work, but no
 such regulations apply to the private sector. Local custom
 has also inhibited the full participation of women in public
 life. Politics, for example, has traditionally been a male
 preserve in Cyprus. Through changing attitudes, however,
 women are experiencing increasing mobility.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Cyprus Constitution provides that "every person has the
 right to a decent existence." The basic document governing the
 
 
 886
 CYPRUS
 Turkish Cypriot community contains similar language. There is
 extensive legislation guaranteeing acceptable conditions for
 workers with respect to minimum wages, hours of work, and
 occupational safety and health. The minimum age for the
 employment of children in an "industrial undertaking" is set
 at the age of 14. These laws are enforced throughout Cyprus.
