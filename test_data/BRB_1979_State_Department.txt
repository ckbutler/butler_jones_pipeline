 BARBADOS
 Barbadians enjoy a free and democratic system. When
 Barbados' Constitution was proclaimed on November 29,
 1966, its drafters noted the island's traditional attach-
 ment to free institutions and to independence. A Parlia-
 ment has sat in Barbados since 1639. A basic statement
 of the rights and privileges of Barbadians, known as
 the Charter of Barbados, was proclaimed in 1652 and has
 generally been upheld by those governing the island.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is specifically prohibited in the Constitution
 and is not practiced in Barbados.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There have been no reports of any form of such treatment
 or punishment in recent memory. The Constitution does
 not prohibit use of the death penalty, and in 1979 courts
 imposed a death sentence on two convicted murderers.
 The sentences are under appeal. Prison conditions in
 Barbados are humane. Prisoners are not physically mal-
 treated, food is adequate,and there are no restrictions
 on visits by relatives. Attorneys have ready access
 to their clients and,while mail is screened,it is not
 arbitrarily restricted.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment are prohibited by the
 Constitution. These guarantees are respected in practice.
 The right to habeas corpus is guaranteed.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides that persons charged with a
 criminal offense be given a fair, public hearing within
 a reasonable time by an independent and impartial court.
 These guarantees are respected in practice.

 e. Invasion of the Home
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary search or entry.
 This guarantee is respected in practice.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The 1966 proclamation of the Constitution calls for the
 Government to promote the general welfare of the citizens
 of Barbados through equitable distribution of wealth.
 Both the past and present governments of Barbados have
 pursued that goal effectively and fairly while respecting
 private property. For example, before the 1976 election,
 the present Barbados Labour Party (BLP) Government commit-
 ted itself to several public welfare goals. These included
 improvements in public housing and community centers
 and an overhaul of the somewhat regressive tax system.
 These goals have all been achieved. Citizens of Barbados
 have long enjoyed access to public and private education-
 al systems, accounting for an adult literacy rate estimated
 at 97 percent. Recognizing that adequate secondary educa-
 tion should be aVailable to all, the government has em-
 barked on a program of expanding the secondary school
 system to ensure that sufficient facilities exist for
 pupils leaving the primary system.
 Under the Government's health program, quality care is
 available to all residents through local clinics and
 hospitals. Government health insurance programs cover
 all Barbadians.
 The Government is believed to be meeting shelter needs
 through its low cost housing program. Overall, Barbadians
 are well-housed.
 The Government has devoted over sixty percent of its
 operating budget and almost thirty percent of its capital
 budget to the fulfillment of vital needs. The Government
 also contributes to the direct provision of essential
 goods and services through involvement in statutory boards
 and corporations. These include the Barbados Marketing
 Corporation, which guarantees distribution of agricultural
 products at reasonable prices, the Public Assistance
 Board, which provides for the indigent, and the Child
 Care Board.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 
 
 254
 
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion, and Assembly
 The Barbados Constitution provides for all of the above
 freedoms, and they are honored in practice. The two
 regular newspapers and the cable radio services function
 independently of the Government. Government ownership
 and operation of the Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation
 (CBC) radio and television service, which is modeled
 after the BBC, leaves the Government open to charges
 of interference in the media, but these charges are rare.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no impediments to free movement of citizens
 or legal residents within or without Barbados. The Consti-
 tution guarantees them the right to move freely throughout
 the country, to reside anywhere in Barbados, to enter
 and leave Barbados, and to be exempt from expulsion.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There are no impediments to free participation in the
 political process. There is no discrimination based
 on race or sex, and labor unions function freely. Labor
 unions are also active politically and participate fully
 in the political process within the context of the two
 major political parties. In keeping with its campaign
 promise, the government established in 1979 a National
 Commission on the Status of Women and created in the
 Ministry of Labor an Office of Women's Affairs which
 is now developing plans for the implementation of the
 Commission's recommendations. These entities would make
 recommendations regarding the elimination of sex discrim-
 ination, including proposed statutory revisions necessary
 to give equal status to Barbadian women.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights:
 There have been no reports of human rights violations
 in Barbados in recent memory and there have been no re-
 quests by governmental or private bodies to investigate
 allegations. Barbados favors strengthening the human
 rights machinery of the United Nations and the Organization
 of American States. The Government favors more investiga-
 tions of alleged violations of human rights in other
 countries and the increased use of fact-finding or observer
 teams to monitor controversial political and electoral
 situations.
