 HONDURAS
 Honduras has been governed by military reqimes since
 December 1972. The highest oolicv-makinq body is a
 Council of thirty military officers. On August 7, 1978,
 the Council aopointed three of its memnbers to reblace
 General Juan Alberto Melgar, who had been designated
 Chief of State over three years before. The new
 Government's leadership has emphasized its commitments
 to hold elections in Aoril 1980 as previously scheduled,
 to supoort respect for human rights and to oursue
 ambitious economic and social development efforts.
 The legislature has been susoended since 1972. Political
 Parties are free to organize and issue statements.
 Freedoms of religion and emigration have qenerallv been
 respected. Voter registration is now underway for the
 1980 elections. Civilian groups, including trade
 unions, oeasant federations and business organizations,
 are free to organize and are active in making their
 views known to the Government. These 3rouDs, aided
 by an active free oress, are often successful in
 influencinq the military leadership. However, the
 final arbiter of political develonments in Honduras,
 at least for the coming year, is likely to remain
 the Council.
 Honduras is an agrarian country with considerable land
 in relation to oooulation. It also has serious
 problems -- illiteracy, ooverty, malnutrition and
 inadequate health care -- which remain far from beinq
 solved.
 The ad-ninistration of justice is hindered by Poorlv
 trained oolice and overburdened courts. Solution
 of these problems will require long-term economic
 and social development.
 1.    Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Includinq
 Freedom fro-n:
 a.   Torture
 In Aoril 1978 a Police lieutenant admitted to having
 "tortured" his prisoner. This was the only reoort of
 torture in 1978. The Government condemned this and
 
 
 279
 
 while others are involved-in new charqes. None, however,
 were alleged to have been held for an extended neriod.
 According to the Deasant federations, the charges are
 trumoed uc and are a form of harassment on the Dart of
 the landowners. Given the tensions raised by almost
 any agrarian reform process, it is probable that at
 least some of these crimes were committed, and the
 fact is that the detainees are held under soecific
 charges. Thouqh some of the federations' claims of
 harrassment are credible, in a November 1978 meetina
 with peasant federation leaders, the military junta nro-
 mised qovernment-financed legal assistance in exoeditinq
 the cases of those arrested.
 Agrarian unrest is endemic in Honduras, with illeial
 land occuoations and sporadic tension. Land redistri-
 bution has slowed over the last two years. Pressure
 tactics by peasant qrouos are sometimes used for
 the ouroose of forcing imnlementation of the aqrarian
 refor.m laws. In fact, after moving squatters off
 land the Government in many cases awards that
 or other land to them.
 The Honduran military and oolice have in the last
 three years generally been successful in movinq
 peole off Drivate land without serious incidents.
 Two army officers were found quiltv in 1978 of havinq
 Participated in a June 1975 killinq of fourteen
 persons in a land invasion dispute in Olancho Province.
 Their civilian co-defendants were acquitted. Both
 prosecution and defense have anoealed the case to
 the Suoreme Court.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Honduran judiciary is inlependent but suffers from
 numerous oroblems. Reform has been a stated qoal of
 recent Supreme Court Presidents but they have been
 unable to make much nroqress in the face of an archaic
 lelal code and a chronic shortage of funds. The
 executive branch olans to increase the juliciarv's
 very low budget for 1979 bv eiqhtv percent. Access to
 the leqal orocess for redress of grievances often
 varies with the socio-economic standing of the indivi-
 dual. Many inordinately lonj delavs are encountered
 in the administration of justice because the system
 is overburdened. In early 1978, 700 to 1000 common
 criminals were pardoned, nartly because of the Government's
 recoqnition that its handlinq of accused persons should
 
 
 280
 be :xoedited. It is noteworthy that, under a military
 government, the courts have tried and found military
 officers guilty of crimes. The Human Rights Commission
 of the Lawyers' Association is becoming more activelv
 involved in monitoring issues, esoecially in the courts,
 that may involve human rights. Trials are generally
 considered fair. Trials are held in judges' chambers
 with the parties to the trial and their attorneys
 oresent.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 There have been no re-oorts of invasion of the home.
 In one well oublicized case, the oolice waited several
 hours for a judicial warrant before entering a house
 they had surrounded.
 2.    Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Honduras' develooment record over the last several vears
 has been imoressive, although the country continues
 to suffer from serious socio-economic ills includino
 malnutrition, inadeauate housing and health services,
 illiteracy and low school attendance. These deficien-
 cies esoeciallv affect the rural ooor in this largelv
 agricultural countrv. In 1974 the Government embarked
 on an ambitious five-vear national develooment olan,
 the orinarv objectives of which are to integrate the
 rural noor into the national economy and substantially
 increase social services in rural areas. The Plan has
 been relatively successful desoite oroblems of imole-
 mentation. Government exoenlitures for economic and
 social development orograms in such sectors Rs agri-
 culture, education and health more than doubled betwe-n
 1974 and 1978 and now reoresent over 40 nercent of the
 total budget. In contrast, defense, includinq oolice
 forces, accounts for 7.5 oercent of the Government
 budget. Siqnificant investments continue to be
 made in ba-sic infrastructure, including transoortation,
 communications and energy.
 The airarian reform efforts suffer from shortages of
 resources, caoital and technical assistance as well as
 from exa-igerated exoectations which sometimes lead to
 heightened tensions. Programs of aqricultural research
 and extension, crop diversification and storage have
 
 
 281
 been expanded. In 1976, a nutrition planninq grouo
 was established within the National Planning Council
 to p3ursue a proqram aimed at Honduras' noor.
 In 1975 the Ministry of Health instituted an ambitious
 orogram to extend basic health services to the rural
 areas. Preventive medicine is emphasized through the
 use of aramedics. Primary education is provided to
 an estimated 57 oercent of primary school age children.
 A high oercentaqe of these never finish primary or
 begin secondary school. Primary education is being
 expanded in rural areas and a more relevant curricu-
 lum is being developed.
 Incidents of corruotion have occurred at all levels of
 society. The Government has investigated charges of
 corruotion and dismissed imolicated officials. Although
 it is not oossible to document the extent of corruotion,
 it has not aooarentlv been a crucial imoediment to
 the develooment orocess.
 3.    Resoect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Freedom of Thought, Soeech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Freedom of thought, speech and religion are respected,
 although books and other materials considered to
 be orooaganda are sometimes confiscated from travellers
 returning from Communist countries.
 Political rallies and parades have been forbidden since
 1972. According to the electoral law, they will be
 mermitted once the campaign for the Aoril 1980 elections
 officially begins in December 1979. Political marties
 are free to hold organizational meetings, some of
 which have been large and omen, as well as to oublicize
 declarations which are often critical of Government
 bolicies. Students, workers and other interest
 grouos have held demonstrations without interference.
 The oress in Honduras is free. The Government has
 exoressed its annoyance at anti-regime news stories,
 but omen criticism of the military authorities has been
 the norm. In July 1978 the five day detention of a
 news'amer director was a cause celebre. He was held
 for questioning by an investigative judge, as mermitted
 
 
 282
 
 by Honduran law, and this was widely regarded as
 a reprisal for aggressive reporting of a narcotics
 scandal which threatened to implicate some military
 officers. A cartoonist for the same newspaper was
 also arrested in July 1978 when the judge found
 sufficient indications of an offence unrelated to his
 newspaper job. He was legally charged and held over five
 months before his lawyers were able to obtain his release
 on Dail on December 8, 1978.
 The new Government leadership has reiterated its
 respect for press freedom. An Inter-American Press
 Association (IAPA) investigation in October found
 that Honduras enjoys a free press. At the same time
 the IAPA said that the arrests and the annoyance
 expressed by the Government were warning signs to
 be watched.
 Honduras has a long tradition of effective and democratic
 trade union activities. The labor movement is well
 structured and has a history of service to its consti-
 tuency. Trade unions are -not hampered by the Government
 in providing members with advisory services, assistance
 in the negotiation of contracts, and special housing.
 The usual reasons for strikes involve wages, grievances
 and efforts to gain union recognition from employers.
 The Texaco Refinery workers had gone on strike on
 August 8, 1977. The next day the workers were called
 into military service on the grounds that uninterrupted
 oil refining was essential to the nation's economy
 and defense. The union was required to arbitrate
 differences with the company. While unhappy with
 the arbitration, the workers nevertheless accepted
 the final decision. A year later, on August 17, 1978,
 ten days after the new military leaders assumed power,
 the union was demilitarized on grounds that changes
 in its leadership and affiliations had rendered it
 more responsible.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 All three of these rights are respected in Honduras,
 although travel to and from El Salvador is restricted
 because of the unresolved 1969 dispute with that country.
 The current mediation effort has not resolved the issues
 of free transit, border delineation, a peace treaty,
 diplomatic relations, and relations within the Central
 
 
 283
 American Common Market. In May 1978 the negotiators
 reached agreement on war reparations ani respect for
 human rights. There are no known Honduran citizens
 in enforced political exile outside the country.
 c. Freedom to Particioate in the Political Process
 Since the 1972 coup the military has exercised power
 and the legislature has been suspended. Elections
 to a constituent assembly are scheduled for Aoril 1980,
 with active camoaigning to begin in December 1979. A
 voter census and registration process began August 15,
 1978. Nevertheless, civilian nolitical Darties,
 labor unions, trade org;anizations an. other interest
 qroups have been free to orqanize and articulate
 their positions.
 Political oarties cannot yet hold vass rallies. How-
 ever, during 1978 the four largest parties narticioated
 in the process of reqistering for the 1980 national
 elections. All parties (including the Communist
 Party), have access to the media and make extensive
 use of it.
 Most women work either as housewives or farm cultivators.
 Of all women aged fifteen to sixtv years, 18.4 nercent are
 members of the labor force. Outside of the agricultural
 sector women most commonly work in iomestic service,
 as itinerant vendors of produce and other foodstuffs,
 and in food processing or clothing manufacture. In
 public service, women are still discriminated against,
 although they have made siqnificant advances. They hold
 a substantial number of key intermediate and senior
 level positions. The educational levels of the female
 labor force in the public sector exceed those of the
 male force, poartly because of the relative scarcity of
 suitable alternative professional emolovment in the
 private sector for educationally qualified women.
 4.    Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investication of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Honduras was one of the first countries to ratify the
 Inter-American Convention on Human Rights. The Honduran
 Government cooperated fully with a 1976 Amnesty Inter-
 national investigative mission and has generally suooorted
 
 
 284
 human rights efforts in the United Nations, e.g. creation
 of a UN High Commission for Human Rights.
