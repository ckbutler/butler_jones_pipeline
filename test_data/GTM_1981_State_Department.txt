 GUATEMALA
 
 Violence, including political violence, has been endemic
 to Guatemala throughout much of its history. This continued
 to be the case in 1981. Following a reduction in left and
 right wing violence during the period 1974-77, Guatemala
 has again been subjected both to terrorism and guerrilla
 warfare from the extreme left, aided and encouraged by Cuba
 and others, and to indiscriminate violence from the extreme
 right, both by government elements and by private individuals
 and groups. Each side finds its justification and excuse
 in the actions of the other.
 The government asserts that it is in a life-or-death struggle
 against well-armed, foreign-supported radical Marxist groups.
 The discovery by the government of over 25 guerrilla safehouses
 containing significant quantities of U.S. weapons from former
 Vietnam stocks, as well as Chinese and Soviet Bloc weapons,
 gives credence to the government view. While guerrillas
 were most active in the central highlands region in 1980,
 during 1981 they extended their activities to almost all
 parts of the country including the Paten, the Pacific lowlands
 and especially the capital city area.
 During 1981 there was a marked increase in clashes between
 guerrilla and military/public security forces. Two hundred
 and eighty-five incidents which could be classified as guer-
 rilla/government clashes occurred during the first nine months
 of 1981, compared to 64 during the same period in 1980. The
 numbers of guerrilla actions increased significantly on dates
 regarded by them as having special significance, such as the
 occupation of the Spanish Embassy (January 31), International
 Labor Day (May 1), the anniversary of the "Panzos Massacre"
 (May 29), the Sandinista takeover of Nicaragua (July 19),
 and the anniversaty of the 1944 revolution (October 20).
 As in previous years, the victims of apparently politically-
 motivated violence were militry and police personnel, govern-
 ment officials, pro-governmefit politicians, priests and
 religious lay persons, opposition political leaders, business-
 men, ranchers, peasants, students, academics, trade union
 activists and professionals such as journalists, doctors
 and lawyers. Increasingly non-combatants are the principal
 victims of the violence from both sides. Killings of peasants
 outside of the capital area steadily increased through the
 year, reaching almost one hundred a month. Some professionals,
 opposition politicans, and peasants have left the country.
 While the number of killings which appeared to be politi-
 cally-motivated ranged from 70 to 100 each month in 1980,
 the estimate for 1981 was 250 to 300 per month. Most of
 .these victims were non-combatants. Kidnappings in 1981
 ranged from 25-30 per month. There has been no evidence
 of arrests or prosecutions for any of these assassinations
 or kidnappings.
 During 1981 victims associated with religious organizations
 included one American priest, Father Stanley Rother, and
 an American Mennonite missionary, John Troyer. As a result
 of the violence against religious figures, the Guatemalan
 Episcopal Conference (the official organization of Catholic
 bishops) criticized both the violence in the country and
 the government's efforts to implicate the Church in the
 guerrilla movement. The Conference document also admonished
 the government for insinuating that the president of the
 
 (441)
 
 
 442
 Episcopal Conference, Bishop Juan Gerardi, who now lives
 in Costa Rica, was encouraging priests to join the guerrillas.
 The heated exchanges between Church and government officials
 resulted in a ministry of education investigation of foreign-
 run Catholic schools to determine whether subversive and
 Marxist-oriented indoctrination was taking place in those
 schools. In September 1981, at a press conference, Jesuit
 priest Luis Eduardo Pellecer stated that he had been a member
 of the Guerrilla Army of the Poor (EGP) for 17 months.
 Some Church officials have alleged that Pellecer's confession
 was coerced.
 The insurgency in Guatemala has had a deleterious impact
 on the country's economy. Credit from foreign suppliers
 and commercial banks has been sharply curtailed, and private
 investment has fallen off. The tourist industry has declined
 greatly. Despite the climate of violence and guerrilla
 war, the present government has made marked progress in
 a massive literacy program, expanding health facilities
 and opening up government lands for colonization by landless
 poor.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom
 from:
 a. Torture
 The constitution and the criminal procedures code prohibit
 torture. However, the Guatemalan press frequently reports
 discoveries of bodies evidencing torture. In most instances
 it has not been possible to establish who the perpetrators
 were. In some cases there is evidence to suggest that elements
 within the military or security forces have been involved.
 In recent months, similar evidence suggests that the guerrilla
 groups have used torture.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Circumstantial evidence links the military with the deaths
 of several individuals at Melchor de Mencos (Peten Department)
 in May 1981, and with the killings of villagers in the Depart-
 ment of Quiche during Holy Week (April 12-18, 1981), in
 Chuabajito (Chimaltenango Department) in April and in Cuilapa
 (Santa Rosa Department) in May. There are also reports
 that the army was responsible for the large-scale massacre
 of all the able-bodied male population of a village in rural
 Guatemala during the latter part of 1981. The level and
 nature of the violence is such that one cannot definitively
 attribute the killings to one group or another. However,
 the greater number of apparently politically-motivated killings
 are probably attributable to groups associated with the
 extreme right or with elements of government forces, rather
 than to the extreme left. This would indicate that the
 government has been unable to bring indiscriminate violence
 under control, whether by elements of its own forces or
 by others.
 The extreme rightist groups, which are largely composed
 of self-appointed vigilantes, are less cohesive than their
 leftist counterparts. Among the rightist groups are the
 so-called Secret Anti-Communist Army (ESA) and the Death
 Squadron. The victims of these groups are usually prisoners
 being transferred from one prison to another, or suspected
 felons who have been released by a court for lack of evidence.
 In at least one instance, a leftist organization appeared
 to be responsible for the death of some prisoners. There
 is no record that anyone has been charged in these cases.
 
 
 443
 c. Disappearances
 In 1981 the number of abductions increased to between 25
 and 30 per month. It is assumed that most of these persons
 are subsequently killed and are counted along with the numerous
 unidentified bodies that turn up in clandestine burial sites.
 Students, labor leaders, campesinos and teachers have been
 the most common kidnap victims of the right, while businessmen
 and/or wealthy citizens or their children have been the
 usual kidnap victims of the left. The kidnap victims of
 the left usually are freed after a high ransom has been
 paid. In one case, however, an American businessman was
 murdered by his leftist captors. A number of citizens of
 all!:political persuasions have gone into self-imposed exile
 or spen-extensive periods out of the country for security
 reasons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitution prohibits arbitrary arrests. However,
 it permits preventive detention but requires consignment
 to the courts or release within five days. The law also
 requires a prisoner to be informed of the charge against
 him within 48 hours of arrest. Habeas corpus procedures
 are honored in criminal cases. For the most part, there
 is little effective investigation of politically-related
 deaths, no matter who the victim or the alleged assassins
 might be. The death in 1981 of Father Stanley Rother remains
 unsolved as does that of Mennonite Missionary John Troyer.
 Lawyers and judges are fearful of becoming involved in any
 politically-tinged crime. Many of them have been themselves
 victims of violent crimes; in 1981 at least 14 lawyers and
 judges were killed.
 There is little specific informationabout political prisoners
 in Guatemala. The most significant case of political prisoners
 was that of two officials of the Christian Democratic Party
 who were arrested and charged with homicide, assault with
 deadly weapons and illegal arms possession. These charges
 grew out 'f their involvement in the defense of the secretary
 general of the party, who was ambushed outside the party
 headquarters in February 1981, allegedly by government security
 forces. After spending four months in jail, they were released
 .after paying a fine for obstruction of justice. Confrontations
 between the government and suspected subversives seldom
 result in prisoners being taken.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for due process for accused persons
 before the courts. It is reported that persons brought
 before the courts generally received fair public trials.
 Generally, the courts appear to be independent of executive
 or military control. Elected by the legislature, supreme
 court justices in turn appoint lower court judges. Under
 Guatemalan law, attorneys have access to clients after formal
 charges are made at a preliminary hearing, which must take
 place within 48 hours of apprehension. The court appoints
 a public defender if the accused lacks private counsel.
 The constitution provides that, except in a state of emergency,
 military courts have jurisdiction over civilians only if
 the latter act as leaders-of armed action against the public
 powers. The organization, composition and function of these
 courts are governed by military laws supplemented by ordinary
 legislation. There have been no reports of military trials
 
 
 444
 of civilians in recent years. As in the case of civil juris-
 diction, verdicts of military courts may be appealed to
 higher civil courts. However, as mentioned above, the threat
 of violent retaliation against judges, lawyers, litigants
 and witnesses and the actual assassination of many of them
 have curbed the operation of the judicial system in Guatemala.
 Recently the Guatemalan government initiated an amnesty
 program at the local level for Guatemalans who have joined
 or collaborated with the insurgents, but now seek protection
 from the violence.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution forbids invasion of the home except when
 authorized by written order of a competent judge. There
 have been reports, however, that in rural areas the army
 and other security forces enter private homes illegally
 in search of guerrillas or weapons. However, government
 forces did show respect for the safety of private citizens
 when they attacked the guerrilla safehouses in July and
 August, by insuring that other residents in and around the
 neighborhood were advised of the danger, told to remain
 in their homes or escorted out of the area.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution guarantees freedom of speech, press and
 religion. Nevertheless, because of the prevailing climate
 of political violence, freedom of expression is inhibited.
 Journalists have been repeatedly threatened and killed by
 both the left and right. For a period the most popular
 news program on television was taken off the air because
 of threats to the producer of the program by the left.
 The director's home was attacked by guerrillas.
 In the outlying areas of the country, over a half-dozen
 radio announcers were killed or kidnapped. Several stations
 were attacked and materially damaged. Evidence as to the
 identify of the perpetrators of these acts is sparse. More
 than ten print and broadcast journalists have been killed
 or kidnapped. There have been two occasions when the govern-
 ment has detained foreign correspondents at the airport,
 refusing to allow them into the country because of previous
 stories they or their principals have printed.
 In spite of this, newspapers and broadcasting media continue
 to operate without government censorship. They often print
 or broadcast stories that criticize government officials
 and policies, but they also practice self-censorship. Occa-
 sionally they have run bulletins paid by militant left-wing
 opposition groups. They also continue to print news releases
 issued by left-wing groups.
 Although Roman Catholics are by far the largest religious
 group, there is no state religion. In recent years, other
 religious groups have been increasing in numbers. Their
 members suffer no political or other disadvantages. One
 indication of pressure on the Catholic Church is that govern-
 ment security forces reportedly have sat in the front pews
 of churches to tape-record the homililies given by parish
 priests. Leftists have threatened the lives of Protestant
 missionaries, in at least one known instance.
 
 
 445
 During 1981 relations between the government and the Catholic
 Church deteriorated. Six priests were kidnapped or killed
 during the year. As a result, the Guatemalan Conference
 of Bishops asked that these crimes be investigated and that
 the government put an end to the continued violence. There
 was no response to this request. The government claimed
 to have killed two foreign priests on July 25 in an attack
 on a guerrilla hideout. It was subsequently revealed that
 a Canadian and a Spaniard who were killed were not priests,
 but religious lay workers. Nevertheless, newspaper stories
 and statements by former guerrillas indicate that some members
 of the clergy have joined the guerrillas. As a result of
 the violence affecting the Church, numerous priests, nuns
 and charitable organization employees have left the country,
 many of them under threat.
 Political protest demonstrations and parades are regulated
 by the ministry of government which, if satisfied that the
 demonstrations will be orderly and non-violent, generally
 issues permits. In previous years, the traditional May 1
 Labor Day parade has been a well-attended event. In 1980
 over a dozen participants were shot by unknown assailants,
 and, in 1981, May 1 passed without any parade or other public
 demonstrations. The Association of University Students
 declared its intention to restrict activity because the
 government "could not guarantee the safety of individuals'
 who participated in May Day parades and programs. Radical
 leftist groups detonated at least 50 propaganda bombs prior
 to May 1 to commemorate "a combative Labor Day", and to
 espouse workers' causes. The extreme left celebrated Labor
 Day by engaging in economic sabotage with attacks on the
 Chevron and Texaco refineries, a nickel mine and the oil
 pipeline.
 Because of the violent atmosphere, labor and trade union
 freedoms are severely restricted. At least 32 labor leaders
 were killed in 1981. During the 1981 session of the Inter-
 national Labor Organization in Geneva, the government was
 again censured for failure to respond to charges of "violation
 of freedom of assembly." Because of the violent deaths
 of so many labor leaders and the self-imposed exile of others,
 the democratic labor movement is virtually at a standstill
 in Guatemala.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are.no legal restrictions on freedom of movement within
 the country. However, one result of increased conflict
 between the army and guerrillas is greater risk for the
 civilian populace when traveling within Guatemala, particu-
 larly in rural areas where guerrillas have been active.
 According to some accounts, small towns in contested areas
 cease all activities with the coming of nightfall. People
 lock themselves in their homes and fear to venture forth.
 Some settlements reportedly even have been abandoned. This
 fear has also influenced the travel of city dwellers. Travel
 from Guatemala City to previously popular tourist attractions,
 such as Chichicastenango, Antigua and Panajachel, has now
 been significantly reduced.
 There are. generally no restrictions on foreign travel or
 on emigration by Guatemalans and no distinction by sex in
 this regard. In fact reports have been received of cam-
 pesinos fleeing into Mexico and (to a lesser degree) Honduras
 to escape violence. However, in some instances movement
 
 
 446
 across borders has been attributed to economic rather than
 security reasons. Persons granted asylum in foreign embassies
 in Guatemala usually receive rapid processing for safe conduct
 out of the country.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The military dominates Guatemalan politics as it has for
 the last three decades. Presidential elections every four
 years have produced peaceful changes of government since
 1966. The elections of 1974 and 1978 were marred by charges
 of massive fraud. Clearly violence and the threat of retri-
 bution have damaged or inhibited free political expression.
 Opposition political parties have been especially hard-hit.
 The Christian Democrats and the United Revolutionary Front,
 both legal left-of-center parties, had over a hundred party
 leaders killed in 1981. There have been three attempts
 on the life of the secretary general of the Christian Demo-
 crats, and the brother of the president of the United Revo-
 lutionary Front, also a high official in the party, was
 killed in 1981. Rightist parties, such as the Movement
 of National Liberation, have also lost numerous party leaders,
 mostly in the rural areas. The extreme right, extreme left
 and elements of the government's security forces and armed
 forces are all suspect in these political assassinations.
 General elections are scheduled for March 1982. The governing
 coalition of three political parties is again supporting
 a military officer, a general and the former minister of
 defense in the present administration who resigned his office
 in August 1981 as required by the electoral law. Four oppo-
 sition parties have named three civilian candidates, in
 contrast to 1974 and 1978, when all the presidential candi-
 dates were military men. Registration and voting in Guatemala
 is mandatory for all literate adults, but not rigorously
 enforced, and is discretionary for illiterates. Forty-two
 percent of the registered electorate participated in the
 1978 elections.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The government has not responded to a 1980 International
 Labor Organization reprimand with regard to human rights
 violations. Amnesty International reported that its dominant
 human rights concern in Guatemala "was that people who opposed
 the government were systematically seized and frequently
 tortured and murdered by both uniformed and plain-clothed
 members of the security forces." The government views Amnesty
 International's reports as biased and inaccurate. The govern-
 ment postponed and has not renewed its 1980 invitation to
 the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights for an on-
 site investigation. At its 1981 session, the United Nations
 Human Rights Commission adopted a resolution, which the
 United States supported, expressing its'profound concern
 at the deterioration of the situation of human rights in
 Guatemala and requesting the secretary-general to continue
 his efforts to establish direct contacts with the Guatemalan
 government on the human rights situation prevailing in that
 country.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 Private enterprise is predominant in the Guatemalan economy.
 The public sector, in terms of personnel, expenditures and
 
 
 447
 services, is relatively small. Its principal source of
 .funding is indirect taxes, principally on agricultural exports
 and luxury goods. The government supports the industrial
 ,and export-oriented agricultural sectors by providing favor-
 able monetary and fiscal policies and the necessary infra-
 structure. Property is privately owned. This right is
 protected. Based on Central Bank data, 1980 per capita
 income.was estimated at $1,061. The official inflation
 rate for 1980 was 3.5 percent. Growth of GNP in 1980 was
 3.5 percent. Income distribution is highly skewed. A re-
 cently completed study, updating findings of an earlier
 San Carlos University project, found that 13 percent of
 -the total population.of. Guatemala can be classified as middle-
 class. While the earlier data are not fully comparable,
 the increase over the past decade has been significant.
 .Large sectors of the population,.including the Indians who
 constLtute over 50 percent of the total population, are
 poor and have limited access to health and education services.
 Thus government programs have given emphasis to improvement
 in these services. Statistics on unemployment are not avail-
 able, but it is believed to have been higher than in 1980.
 -Underemployment is endemic in Guatemala. The rate of popu-
 lation growth is estimated at 2.9 percent. Mortality and
 morbidity rates remain high.
 Significant elements within Guatemalan society and the govern-
 ment-espouse an expanded role for government in promoting
 equitable economic and social development. The 1979-1983
 national.development plan -projects transformation of the
 rural economy, with emphasis on productive infrastructure,
 the extension of .free health and education services through
 the ninth grade and industrial decentralization into rural
 areas.                      I
 .During the first six months of 1981, the Guatemalan government
 conducted the first stage of a national literacy campaign.
 Some 467,461 persons were.enrolled, of whom 283,483 were
 reported to-have achieved basic literacy. The cost of this
 phase of the program was $10.4 million, of which the govern-
 .ment contributed $7.4 million and the Guatemalan mass media
 -donated publicity valued at $3 million. The national rate
 of illiteracy, according to the government, has been reduced
 -from 54.4 percent to 47.4 percent as a result of this effort.
 During the past three years the government has constructed
 144 new schools, rebuilt 379 and expanded 11. It has also
 provided training and in-service education through the Tech-
 nical Training and National Public. Administration Institutes
 for almost 150,000 of its employees.
 While adequate shelter for the poor continues to be a major
 problem, ambitious programs in low-cost housing were initiated
 with-the support of international donors. Some 27,000 fam-
 ilies were expected to benefit over the next few years from
 these programs.
 In the area of health, a high rate of maternal mortality
 has been associated with pregnancy and child bearing. Life
 expectancy is 60 years for "Ladinos* (persons who have adopted
 western culture) and 50 years for Indians. Infant mortality
 is 89 per 1,000 live births (160 in rural areas).
 During the past year, the government approved $6.9 million
 as counterpart for a $5.8 million external loan that eventually
 will extend primary health care to 800,000 rural people,
 primarily Indians. There are now 636 health posts and centers
 in the. rural areas, as compared with none ten years ago.
 
 
 448
 A paramedics school now graduates 35 students a year to
 help staff these facilities. In sanitation, a program has
 been developed and implemented to improve the dwellings
 of 1,500 families through new types of latrines, stoves,
 floors, water tanks and filters. Some 225 midwives have
 been trained in the past year in sterile delivery techniques
 and breast feeding promotion. The health ministry has con-
 ducted a cervical cancer detection campaign which has reached
 more than 30,000 women in rural areas. The health ministry
 has also recently completed and inaugurated a new school
 for auxiliary nurses in Jutiapa which projects 100 graduates
 per year. Modern medicine nevertheless reaches only 35
 percent of the population. The doctor per capita ratio
 is 3.03/1,000; the nurse per capita ratio is 2.02/1,000;
 the technician per capita ratio is 7.55/1,000; and the hos-
 pital bed per capita ratio is 1.5/1,000. Abortion, although
 forbidden under the penal code, is common. Half of maternal
 deaths are the result of septic abortions. However, the
 government, in response to pressure groups, including well-
 organized women's organizations, recently approved family
 planning facilities to be administered through rural public
 health stations.
 Large tracts of government lands are being opened up for
 colonization by the landless poor. The Guatemalan mili-
 tary provides substantial logistic and material support
 to this program. Since the beginning of the current adminL-
 stration in 1978, almost 60,000 titles have been delivered,
 benefiting 300,000 individuals. The goal is the distribution
 of 100,000 titles before the present administration leaves
 office in 1982. The government is currently spending 25
 percent of its agricultural budget for colonization of the
 northern transversal belt. The present government has also
 continued its predecessor's encouragement of an important
 rural cooperative movement and has established a cooperative
 development institute for promotion, training and technical
 assistance.
 The constitution prohibits sexual discrimination, but his-
 torical, cultural and social factors traditionally have
 relegated women to an inferior status. A growing number
 of women are taking advantage of higher education opportun-
 ities and constitute over 25 percent of university enrollment.
 Women are becoming increasingly active in the labor force.
 However, wage levels for comparable work are lower, and
 managerial positions are still dominated by men. On June 10,
 1981, a presidential decree created a Women in Development
 Office within the ministry of labor. This national office
 will be responsible for integrating women into the national
 development process and coordinating the efforts among private
 and public sector institutions.
