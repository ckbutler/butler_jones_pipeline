 MALTA
 Malta is a constitutional republic and parliamentary democracy. The Head of
 State (President) appoints as Head of Government (Prime Minister) the leader of
 the party that gains a plurality of seats in the quinquennial elections for the uni-
 cameral legislature.
 The police are commanded by a civilian commissioner under the effective super-
 vision of the Government.
 The economy is a mixture of state-owned and private industry, with tourism and
 light manufacturing as the largest sectors.
 The Government is strongly committed to human rights. An independent judiciary
 upholds the Constitution's protections for individual rights and freedoms. However,
 societal discrimination against women remains widespread.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 extrajudicial killing.
 b. Disappearance-There were no known instances of political disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment. There
 were no reports of violations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides for freedom
 from arbitrary arrest and detention. There were no reports of violations. The police
 may arrest a person for questioning, on the basis of reasonable suspicion, but within
 48 hours must either release the suspect or lodge charges. Arrested persons have

 no right to legal counsel during this 48-hour period. Persons incarcerated pending
 trial are granted access to counsel Bail is normally granted.
 The law prohibits political exile. No cases were reported.
 e. Denil of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent of the other
 branches.
 The Constitution requires a fair public trial before an impartial court. Defendants
 have the right to counsel of their choice or (if they cannot pay the cost) to court-
 appointed counsel at public expense. Defendants enjoy a presumption of innocence.
 T  may confront witnesses, and present evidence. They also have the right of ap-
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution protects privacy of the home and prohibits electronic surveillance. The
 Government respects these provisions. Search warrants are issued by police officers
 of the rank of inspector or above based on perceived reasonable grounds for sus-
 picion of wrongdoing.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution protects freedom of speech and
 press, and the Government respects this. However, the 1987 Foreign Interference
 Act bans foreign participation in local politics, including speechmaking, during a pe-
 riod leading up to elections. Three daily, seven weekly, and one biweekly newspaper
 freely express diverse views.
 Academic freedom is generally respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly. Police permits are routinely issued for political meet-
 ings and other public activities.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution protects freedom of religion, and the
 Government fully respects this. The state-supported religion is Roman Catholicism.
 The Government grants subsidies only to Roman Catholic schools. Students in gov-
 ernment schools have the option to decline instruction in Roman Catholicism.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not arbitrarily restrict movement within the
 country, foreign travel, or emigration. A court order may prohibit the departure
 from the country of anyone who is the subject of a formal complaint alleging
 nonfulfillment of an obligation, such as nonpayment of a debt or nonsupport of an
 estranged spouse.
 Since 1992 the Government has granted temporary refugee status to over 900 per-
 sons, pending their relocation abroad, and has provided assistance and counseling
 in cooperation with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The Gov-
 ernment expels or repatriates persons it deems to be economic refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercise this right in multiparty, secret-ballot elections held every 5 years
 on the basis of universal suffrage for those 18 years of age or over. In the 1992 elec-
 tion, 96 percent of the electorate voted.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Various human rights organizations and persons interested in promoting and pro-
 tecting human rights operate freely. The Government also places no restrictions on
 investigations by international human rights groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and law prohibit discrimination based on gender, they do not ad-
 dress other discriminatory factors.
 Women.-The Constitution provides that all citizens have access, on a nondiscrim-
 inatory basis, to housing, employment, and education. However, the society tradi-
 tionally does not treat women's rights as matters of human rights; reflecting this,
 the Government has been passive regarding women's rights.
 Women constitute a growing    rti  of the work force, but most either remain in
 traditional "women's jobs (such as sales clerk, secretary, bank teller, teacher, or
 nurse) or move into more rewarding jobs only in family-owned businesses or in a
 certain few professions (e.g., medicine). Women generally earn less than their male
 counterparts.
 There is no widespread pattern of family violence against women, but a continu-
 ing increase in reports of such incidents has made plain that the problem is not neg-
 
 
 893
 ligible. A special police unit and several voluntary organizations provide assistance
 to victims of domestic violence. For women who are threatened or physically abused,
 the Government also maintains an emergency fund, and subsidizes a shelter,
 Available data show prosecutions of six rape cases in 1994. Rape carries a sen-
 tence of up to 10 years. The law treats spousal rape the same as other rape. Divorce
 and abortion are not legal in Malta.
 Children.-The Government views the rights of children within the context of gen-
 eral family law. Specific legislation to protect children's rights has languished in the
 Parliament for the past 2 years. Meanwhile, the number of reported cases of child
 abuse has grown as public awareness has increased, but it is not clear whether the
 actual number of incidents has increased.
 Persons With Disabilitie&-The law protects the rights of the disabled. The 1969
 Employment of Disabled Persons Act led to greater employment of disabled persons
 in government agencies. The 1992 Structures Act requires accessibility to public
 buildings for people with physical disabilities, but implementation has been slow.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to associate freely and to
 strike, and the Government respects this. Only noncivilian personnel of the armed
 forces and police are prohibited from striking. There are 24 registered trade unions,
 representing about 50 percent of the work force.
 Although all unions are independent of political parties, the largest, the General
 Workers'Union, is generally regarded as having close informal ties with one party.
 There is no prohibition on unions affiliating internationally.
 Under the Industrial Relations Act of 1976, the responsible minister may refer
 labor disputes either to the Industrial Tribunal (a government-appointed body con-
 sisting of representatives of government, employers, and employee groups) or to
 binding arbitration. The International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee of Ex-
 perts objects to a provision of the Act that permits compulsory arbitration to be held
 at the request of only one of the parties, but neither unions nor employers appear
 to object to this provision. In practice, a striking union can ignore an unfavorable
 decision of the Tribunal by continuing the strike on other grounds. No disputes were
 referred to the Tribunal in 1994.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers are free, in law and
 practice, to organize and bargain collectively. Unions and employers meet annually
 with government representatives to work out a comprehensive agreement regulating
 industrial relations and income policy.
 Under the Industrial Relations Act, an employer may not take action against any
 employee for participation or membership in a trade union. Complaints may be pur-
 sued through a court of law, through a tripartite (union-employers-government) tri-
 bunal, or through the Commission Agint Injustices (a government-appointed body
 composed of representatives of the Government and the opposition); but most dis-
 putes are resolved directly between the parties. Workers fired solely for union activi-
 ties must be reinstated.
 Malta has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-  e Constitution bans forced
 labor, and it does not occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits employment of
 children younger than age 16. This is generally respected, but there is some employ-
 ment of underage children during summer months, especially as domestics, res-
 taurant kitchen help, or vendors. The Department of Lor enforces the law effec-
 tively, but is lenient in cases of summer employment of underage youth in busi-
 nesses run by their families.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage, $103 (40.33 Malta
 liri) per week, affords a decent standard of living for a worker and family with the
 addition of government subsidies for housing, health care, and education. Wage
 Councils, composed of representatives ofgovernment, business and unions, regulate
 workhours; for most sectors the standard is 40 hours per week, but in some trades
 it is 43 or 45 hours per week.
 Government regulations prescribe daily rest periods of I hour. The\law mandates
 an annual paid vacation of 22 work days. The Department of Labor 'effectively en-
 forces these requirements.
 After several years of debate, and amid reports of an increasing number of indus-
 trial accidents, Parliament passed the Occupational Health and Safety (Promotion)
 Act in February 1994. The Act calls for the establishment of an agency to take over
 enforcement responsibility from the Department of Labor, which has been lax re-
 garding these matters. A date for implementation has yet to be set.
