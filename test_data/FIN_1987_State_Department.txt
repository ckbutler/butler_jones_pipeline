 FINLAND
 A constitutional republic, Finland is a democratic state built
 upon the principle of the rule of law. Sovereign power rests
 with the people as represented by.their delegates assembled in
 Parliament. Supreme executive power is vested in the
 President. A Cabinet, consisting of a Prime Minister and 17
 ministers and responsible to Parliament, works with the
 President in governing the country. Judicial power is
 exercised by an independent judiciary consisting of the
 Supreme Court and the Supreme Administrative Court. The
 Finnish people freely choose by direct election the 200-member
 unicameral Parliament every 4 years. They also choose
 electors every 6 years who, in turn, elect the President.
 The security apparatus is controlled by elected officials and
 supervised by courts.
 Finland has a mixed economy with state-owned, privately owned,
 and publicly owned companies. Citizens are free to pursue
 their legitimate private interests, hold private property, and
 engage in economic activity without government interference.
 During 1987 there were no reported violations in Finland of
 fundamental human rights. There is no discrimination against
 national minorities. Women enjoy the same economic and
 political rights as men.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Killing for political motives did not occur.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported cases of disappearance, abduction, or
 clandestine detention.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. By law, prisoners must be treated justly with
 respect for their human dignity and without distinction on the
 basis of race, sex, language, nationality, religious or
 political conviction, social position, wealth, or any other
 grounds.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment or exile is
 guaranteed-by law and respected in practice. A suspect may be
 detained by the police for questioning for 3 days, but for
 special reasons not specified in the law this period may be
 extended by 14 additional days. A suspect may, in the latter
 case, be kept in custody only on order of an authority with
 the right to remand a person for trial. That authority must
 immediately notify the court of the extension. During the
 investigative period, the accused may be denied access to a
 lawyer. The State pays legal fees for the indigent. A court
 
 
 903
 FINLAND
 hearing must take place within 8 days of notification of the
 arrest, if in a city, or within 30 days, if in rural areas.
 The circumstances of the arrest are subject to judicial review
 when the accused is brought to trial. Should the arrest be
 shown to have been incorrect, or should the accused be found
 innocent, he may apply to the same court for civil damages for
 loss of freedom.
 A reform of the pretrial procedures was confirmed by the
 President in 1987 and will take effect on January 1, 1989. It
 shortens the detention period to 7 days and gives the accused
 access to a lawyer during that time. The purpose was to
 achieve uniformity with the practice of other Western
 countries. Parliament's Legislative Committee made some
 changes in the original bill to ensure that the detention
 period would under no circumstances exceed the maximum of
 7 days.
 The institutions of habeas corpus and bail do not exist as
 such in Finland. Those accused of serious crimes must by law
 remain in custody. Those accused of minor offenses may be
 released on personal recognizance at the court's discretion.
 Preventive detention is authorized only during a declared
 state of war for narrowly defined offenses, such as treason,
 mutiny, and trafficking in arms. Supervisory personnel from
 the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of the Interior, as
 well as the Parliamentary Ombudsman and the Chancellor of
 Justice, have authority to enter prisons and to order the
 release of prisoners held without charges.
 New legislation on the status of conscientious objectors to
 Finland's obligatory military service was passed in 1985. It
 took effect at the beginning of 1987 for a trial period of
 5 years. Giving a person the option of serving in the
 military or becoming a conscientious objector, the law
 abolishes the Investigative Board which previously decided
 whether to confer the status of conscientious objector. The
 new law also lengthens alternative civilian service for
 conscientious objectors to 16 months, twice the minimum length
 of military service. Jehovah's Witnesses are exempted from
 military service altogether under the new law.' The passage of
 the bill stemmed from the Investigative Board's rejection of
 an increasing number of applications for civilian service in
 recent years. A small number of total objectors, i.e., those
 who do not accept even unarmed alternative service on the
 grounds that it is part of the military system of national
 defense, have been sentenced to prison. They regard the new
 law as a punishment because the required service is longer
 than military service. Ten objectors are serving a sentence
 of 1 year in jail, about'30 have been sentenced to jail, and
 another 30 await trial. Amnesty International (AI) has
 adopted some of these total objectors as "prisoners of
 conscience."
 Exile has not been used as punishment in Finland. By law,
 Finnish citizens cannot be exiled. There is no forced labor
 in Finland.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to fair public trial is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. Finnish citizens and aliens legally
 present in Finland have the right to effective counsel.
 
 
 904
 FINLAND
 Charges must be clearly stated. Civilians may not be tried by
 military courts except in time of war. There are no separate
 "security" courts, although local courts may decide to conduct
 a trial behind closed doors in juvenile, matrimonial, and
 guardianship cases, or when publicity would offend morality or
 endanger the security of the State. In "national security"
 cases, the judge may withhold from the public any or all
 information pertaining to charges against individuals,
 verdicts, or sentencing. Sanctions may be imposed if such
 information is made public. Provisional tribunals are
 constitutionally prohibited.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right to privacy and the sanctity of the home, including
 prohibition of eavesdropping and mail tampering, are
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice. The security
 police are subject by law to judicial scrutiny.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Law and practice, an effective judiciary, an independent
 press, and a functioning democratic political system assure
 freedom of speech and press. There have been no instances of
 abuse or legal decisions restricting freedom of the press.
 The press occasionally exercises restraint in treating issues
 deemed to be potentially haimful to the national interest but
 is under no compulsion from the Government to do so.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is guaranteed by
 the Constitution. However, if the purpose of association is
 to influence political issues, only Finnish citizens may
 belong. Public demonstrations require notification to the
 police.
 Trade unions are constitutionally guaranteed the right to
 organize, assemble peacefully, and strike. They enjoy a
 protected status-and play an important role in political and
 economic life. The average rate of organization in the labor
 force is above 80 percent. A 1-million-member blue-collar
 confederation, the Central Organization of Finnish Trade
 Unions, the SAK, dominates the trade union movement. Three
 other central organizations cover white-collar, professional,
 and technical employees. All trade unions are democratically
 organized and managed and are independent of the Government.
 Most unions maintain relations with their Nordic counterparts.
 The four confederations also have bilateral contacts with the
 Soviet All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions. The SAK and
 one white-collar confederation are members of the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Two affiliates of the SAK
 have ties'to Communist-dominated trade union internationals.
 Finnish trade unions participate in the International Labor
 Organization.
 The Government encourages voluntary organizations and
 subsidizes private groups formed to achieve a public purpose.
 They are permitted to maintain relations with other
 international groups in both Communist and Western countries.
 
 
 905
 FINLAND
 If the membership of an organization is more than one-third
 foreign, the group requires the Government's permission to
 operate.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Finland has two state religions: the Lutheran and the
 Orthodox. Taxes are collected by the Government from members
 to support these churches. Other Christians, Moslems, and
 Jews enjoy unrestricted freedom of worship. Approximately
 89.5 percent of the population belongs to the Lutheran Church.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Finns are free to travel within the area of the Nordic
 countries--Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland--
 without passports, and need not apply for exit visas for
 travel to other countries. Over 200,000 Finns have emigrated
 to Sweden in the past.. decades to seek employment, and over
 one-half of them have returned. Net emigration is constantly
 decreasing. No restrictions have been placed on emigration or
 repatriation.
 There has been debate on the criteria which the Finnish
 Government applies when deciding to grant political asylum.
 The Government maintains that, "in accordance with the Geneva
 Agreement, Finland gives asylum to individuals arriving (in
 Finland) who have the characteristics of refugees determined
 by the agreement." The Ministry of the Interior denies that
 any agreement exists with the Soviet Union regarding
 repatriation of Soviet would-be refugees.
 This issue recently reemerged in connection with an Amnesty
 International (AI) memorandum submitted to Finnish authorities
 at the end of September 1987. Based on thorough research and
 a visit of a team in June 1986, AI referred to the cases of
 12 Soviet citizens said to have been repatriated by Finland in
 1959-1982. The number of people applying for political asylum
 in Finland is very low: about 20 per year. According to the
 memorandum, all the Soviets repatriated were arrested after
 their return to the U.S.S.R., and two of them are still in
 prison. AI was concerned over the fact that Finland does not
 appear to have uniform rules of procedure. The Ministry of
 the Interior replied that it would look into the matter
 seriously. At the same time, the Government issued written
 instructions translated into several languages for the use of
 aliens potentially applying for political asylum.
 Finnish authorities believe that the current legislation
 related to aliens needs to be amended. For example, the law
 leaves it up to the police to decide how long to detain an
 applicant. They may detain the person for a period of 7 days
 and may repeat the decision as many times as they wish.
 Periods of detention have varied from 5 days to 10 weeks. A
 detainee may not contact a lawyer but only the Curator of
 Alien Affairs. The law does not define the grounds on which
 the applicant for political asylum may be repatriated, so
 instructions have to be sought in the U.N. Refugee Treaty,
 which Finland has signed. The authorities believe that such
 instructions should be unambiguously stated in Finnish
 legislation.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Finland is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy in which all
 citizens over the age of 18 freely elect their representatives
 from among multiple lists of candidates representing a wide
 spectrum of political ideologies. At present, there are seven
 political parties and a group of the Greens represented in
 Parliament. The country has the longest tradition of women's
 suffrage in Europe, and there are at present 63 women
 representatives in Parliament and 4 female Cabinet ministers.
 New legislation providing a more direct popular election of
 the President will be implemented for the first time in 1988.
 According to the legislation, two ballots are cast, one for
 the preferred presidential candidate, the other for the
 electoral candidate. In case none of the presidential
 candidates receives a simple majority of the votes, the
 electoral college conducts the final election.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Within Finland, several organizations monitor human rights
 performance, including the Finnish Red Cross, the
 government-sponsored Equality Council, the Women's Rights
 Union, and Amnesty International. A Finnish Helsinki Watch
 group was established in July 1985 but has not been very
 active. In connection with the Swedish-language University in.
 Turku, a Human Rights Institute was founded in the spring of
 1985. Its purpose is to conduct human rights research and
 studies as well as distribute information.
 Finland participates actively in international human rights
 organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Food, shelter, health care and education are available to all
 inhabitants regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background, or political opinion.
 To redress existing inequities between the sexes, the
 government-established Council for Equality coordinates and
 sponsors legislation to meet the needs of women as workers,
 mothers, widows, and retirees. The new equality legislation,
 a comprehensive Equal Rights Bill, which ensures equal
 treatment for women in the workplace, took effect at the
 beginning of 1987. An Equal Rights Ombudsman entered office
 at the same time. Government statistics indicate that women's
 wages and salaries as a percentage of those of men remained at
 approximately the level of the previous year, 78 percent.
 A new surhame law, permitting women to retain their maiden
 names after marriage as their only surname, took effect in
 January 1986. It also makes it possible for the man to take
 his wife's name. A partly reformed marriage legislation will
 take effect at the beginning of 1988, changing some of the
 principles according to which property is to be divided in
 case of divorce and death.

 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Finland rigorously upholds international standards on working
 conditions, child labor, and occupational safety and health.
 The minimum age for full time employment is 16 years.
 However, the law permits youths of 14 and 15 years of age to
 spend up to two-thirds of their school holidays at work up to
 a maximum of 7 hours per day and 36 hours per week. Workers
 under 18 years of age also work less than a standard workweek,
 and night work is prohibited.
 The minimum wage varies according to the industry but averages
 more than $3.50 per hour. A 40-hour workweek is standard,
 although persons in straight-shift work have a 36-hour
 workweek and those in certain occupations can work longer in a
 week, subject to an 80-hour or 120-hour maximum in 2 or 3
 weeks respectively. Finnish female labor participation in the
 last quarter of 1986 was 63.6 percent, while that of men was
 71.9 percent.
 Several laws protect workers while on the job and in transit
 to and from their work. Enforcement machinery includes the
 National Board of Labor Protection and labor protection
 delegates elected by the workers themselves. Cooperation
 between labor and management has been mandatory by statute
 since 1974.
