 CYPRUS
 Cyprus has been divided since the Turkish military intervention of 1974, following
 a coup d'etat directed from Greece. Since 1974 the southern part of the country has
 been under the control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus. The northern
 part is ruled by an autonomous Turkish Cypriot administration supported o the
 presence of Turkish troops. In 1983 that Administration proclaimed itself the  k-
 ish Republic of Northern Cyprus* ("TRNC'), which is recognized only by Turkey.
 Both parts of the island are ruled in accordance with democratic principles affirmed
 through regularly held, free and fair elections. The Greek Cypriot political system
 is a presidential system while the Turkish Cypriots use a parliamentary form of
 government.
 In general, the police forces of both sides accord respect to the rule of law. There
 is little crime in Cyprus, and consequently relatively few arrests occur.
 Both Cypriot economies operate on the basis of free market principles although
 in both communities there are significant state-run enterprises. In the dreek Cyp-
 riot economy, increases in tourism and exports are expected to lead to a growth rate
 of about 4.6 percent, more than double the 1993 rate. The Turkish Cyprot economy
 relies heavily upon subsidies from Turkey and is burdened by an overly large public
 sector. Inflation remains a significant problem, exceeding 100 percent in 1994, and
 the economy is expected to experience net negative growt for 1994.
 Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot authorities generally accord a high degree of
 respect to established human rights norms and practices. Nonetheless, in the Greek
 Cypriot community there were instances of police brutality, including beating and
 expulsion of Turkish Cypriots by Greek Cypriot police. Domestic violence is also re-
 ceiving increased attention as a legal and social issue in both communities, rather
 than as a purely personal or cultural matter.
 Significant problem areas include continuing restrictions imposed by Turkish Cyp-
 riot authorities on the right of Turkish Cyprots to travel to the southern part of
 the island and Turkish Cypriot noncompliance with the terms of the 1975 Vienna-
 II Agreement which set forth the rights of Greek Cypriots remaining in areas
 under Turkish Cypriot control.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kiling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of persons abducted, secretly arrested,
 or held in clandestine detention.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Both the Cyprus Constitution and the basic law governing the Turkish Cypriot com-
 munity specifically prohibit torture. Freedom from crue, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or pumshment is provided for in law in both communities. While these
 laws are widely respected in practice, there were credible reports during April that
 Greek Cypriot police rounded up 22 Turkish Cypriots on three separate occasions,
 beat them, and then "deported" them to the Turkish Cypriot-controlled area. It ap-
 peared that at least one group of deportees consisted of long-term residents in the
 Greek Cypriot-controlled area, while others may have been Turkish Cypriots who
 crossed the "Green Line! in search of work.
 In July defense attorneys for two Greek Cypriot youths charged with armed rob-
 bery claimed that their clients had been beaten in police custody. There has been
 no independent verification that the police in fact committed the beatings.
 In another instance, lawyers for a 31-year-old man, whom police mistakenly took
 into custody on suspicion of bank robbery and then allegedly tortured, filed an appli-
 cation, which is still awaiting action, against the Republic of Cyprus on the basis
 of the European Convention on Ruman Rights. Two policemen accused in the case
 were acquitted in July 1993 after the courts ruled that the suspect had in fact been
 beaten in police custody but had been mistaken in his identification of the two offi-
 cers responsible. According to some independent observers, the alibis the police offi-
 cers produced appeared credible.
 A 1993 bill introduced in the Cyprus Parliament addressing police brutality is still
 under consideration. The bill would provide for, among other things, detention of the
 accused in cells not under direct police control medical examination of detainees im-
 mediately upon arrest, and severe penalties ?or law enforcement officials convicted
 of violating these provisions. In December a parliamentary subcommittee voted to
 broaden the jurisdiction of the official Ombudsman to look into allegations of police
 brutality.

 While there were no public allegations or media reports of police brutality in the
 Turkish Cypriot community, credible reports indicate that there were some in-
 stances of police brutality.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Laws providing for freedom from arbi-
 trary arrest and detention are respected by the plice forces of both communities.
 Judicially issued arrest warrants are required. No one may be detained for more
 than 1 day without referral of the case to the courts for extension of the period of
 detention. Most periods of investigative detention do not exceed 8 to 10 days before
 formal charges are filed. Attorneys have free access to detainees, and bail is per-
 mitted.
 Exile is specifically prohibited by the Greek Cypriot Constitution and by the basic
 law governing the Turkish Cypriot community.
 e. Denial of  Fair Public Tria!.--C-yprus inherited many elements of its legal sys-
 tem from the British legal tradition, including the presumption of innocence, the
 right to due process, and the right of appeal. Throughout Cyprus, fair public trial
 is provided for in law and accorded in practice. The .judiciary is independent of exec-
 utive or military control. Defendants have the right to be present at their trials, to
 be represented by counsel (at government expense for those who cannot afford one),
 to confront witnesses, and to present evidence in their own defense. There are no
 special courts to try security or political offenses.
 On the Turkish Cypriot side, vilians deemed to have violated military zones are
 subject to trial in a mtary court. These courts consist of one military and two civil-
 ian judges and a civilian prosecutor. Defendants in military courts have all the due
 process rights available in civilian courts. There were no trials of civilians in mili-
 tary courts in 1994.
 There are noepoitical prisoners in Cypras.
 fi Arbitra eference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.- Both
 the Cyprus Constitution and the basic law governing the Turkish Cypriot commu-
 nity include prvisions protecting the individual against arbit rary interference by
 the authorities. A judicial warrant is required for a police official to enter a private
 residence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and press are provided for
 by law and are freely practiced throughout the island. The proliferation of party and
 independent newspapers and periodicals in both communities enables ideas and ar-
 guments to circulate freely, and opposition papers frequently criticize the authori-
 ties.
 Several private television and radio stations in the Greek Cyriot community
 cornte effectively with the government-controlled stations. Turkish Cypriot au-
 thortoies retain a monopoly over local radio and television, which tend not to criti-
 cize them. By June 1994, rmissioan hd bee g   e for the operation of two univer-
 sity-run radio stations in tiosia and Famiagust  However,  e permission granted
 was temporary, and the radio stations remained under the control of the Turkish
 Cypriot radio and television authorities. International broadcasts are available with-
 out interference rou out the island, includin telecasts from Turkey and Greece.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Associatron.The freedom to associate, orga-
 nize, and hold meetings is protected by law and respected in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is respected in Cyprus. Although mis-
 sonaries have the legal right to proselytize in both communities, mission d activi-
 ties are closely monitored by theGrek Cypriot Orthodox Church and by both Greek
 Cypriot and Turkish riot authorities.
 Both Turkish Cypriots residing in the southern part of the island and non-Mus-
 lims in the north are allowed to practice their religion freely. However, a major
 Greek Cypriot holy site located in the Turkish Cypriot-controlled area, the mon-
 asteiy at Apostolos Andreas, may only be visited under existing regulations twice
 a year, despite the Vienna-IrI Agrement of 1975 guaranteeing freedom of move-
 ment for Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots who elected to remain in areas con-
 trolled by the other community. In November the Turkish Cypriot authorities per-
 mitted an elderly priest and a companion resident in the government-controled area
 to conduct services at Adostolos Andreas on the Saint's name day, fulfilling a long-
 standing desire of the priest to visit his ancestral home.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Tudish Cypriot    ee Cy       ts enjoy general freedom of move-
 ment within their respective areas. However, Turkish priot authorities reguarly
 restrict or deny permission for travel by Turkish Cypriots into the Greek yriot
 area. Turkish Cypriots who apply for ermission to visit the south are required to
 justify their applications with formal invitations to events arranged by individuals
 
 
 790
 or organizations resident in the Greek Cypriot community. Many of these applica-
 tions are denied, often without an official reason, although the basis for most deni-
 als is clearly political rather than the ostensible "national security" grounds some-
 times cited. The treatment of applications appears to be related to the state of
 intercommunal relations or the status of negotiations on the Cyprus issue. In mid-
 1994, Turkish Cypriot authorities began to prohibit travel by Turkish Cypriots to
 the south after a period of relative openness following the inauguration of a new
 coalition "government' in January.
 The applications of Greek Cypriot residents of enclaves in the north to visit the
 goverment-ontrled area are usually granted, but the appicants must return
 ithin a designated period or risk losing their right to return, as well as their prop-
 erty. Turkish Cypriot authorities usually deny requests for Greek Cypriot children
 over the age of 16 (male) and 18 (female) residing in the government-controlled area
 to visit their parents in the Karpas. Requests by other relatives are also generally
 denied. However, in December the Turkish yriot authorities granted permits to
 all 30 children who had requested them regardless of age. In addion, they granted
 permits for the first time to nine grandchildren resident in the government-con-
 trolled area to visit their Greek Cypriot grandparents in the Karpass Peninsula.
 Without prior permission, the Turkish Cypriot authorities also generally bar
 Greeks, Greek Cypriots, and even third-country nationals with Greek or Armenian
 surnames from entering the territory under their control.
 The Greek Cypriot authorities permit only day travel by tourists to the northern
 part of the island. The Greek Cypriot authorities have declared that it is illegal to
 enter Cyprus except at authorized entry points in the south, effectively barring
 entry into the Greek Cypriot area by foreigners who have entered Cyprus from the
 north. Similarly authorities bar entry to the north by those intending to depart by
 this route. Following the March assassination, allegedly by Turkish agents, of the
 Director of a Greek Cypriot association supporting Kurds in Turkey, the Greek Cyp-
 riot authorities placed significantly tighter controls on the movement of Turkish
 Cypriots to the Greek Cypriot-controlled areas. Institutions and individuals sponsor-
 ing visits of Turkish Cypriots to the Greek Cypriot-controlled areas must notify the
 Greek Cypriot police in advance and provide them with an exact itinerary.
 The authorities respect the right to travel abroad and to emigrate. Turkish Cyp-
 riots have difficulty traveling to most countries because travel documents issued by
 the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" are recognized only by Turkey. Most
 Turkish Cypriots resort to utilizing Turkish travel documents instead.
 The Government of Cyprus does not accept third-country refugees for resettlement
 in Cyprus on the grounds that it already has enough responsibilities in caring for
 those displaced after the 1974 Turkish intervention. All refugee and asylum claim-
 ants are referred to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which con-
 siders their applications. The Government has been cooperative in extending resi-
 dency permission to those with pending applications and does not generally repatri-
 ate claimants to their home country. There has been no resettlement of displaced
 Cypriots.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Multiparty political systems exist in both communities. In the Greek Cypriot com-
 munity, political parties compete for popular support actively and without restric-
 tion. Suffrage is universal, and elections are held by secret ballot. Elections for the
 office of President are held every 5 years and for members of the House of Rep-
 resentatives every 5 years or less. The small Maronite, Armenian, and Latin com-
 munities vote for nonvoting representatives from their respective communities, as
 well as for a candidate as a voting member in the House of Representatives. How-
 ever, under the terms of the 1960 Constitution Turkish Cypriots may only vote for
 the position of the Vice President and for Turkish Cypriot Members of Parliament.
 As a result, Turkish Cypriots living in the government-controlled area may not vote.
 The Turkish Cypriots elect a leader and a representative body every 5 years or
 less. The Turkish Cypriot voters went to the polls on December 12, 1993, in an early
 election that brought opposition party representatives back into power and resulted
 in a new coalition. Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the north are barred by
 law from participating in Turkish Cypriot elections but may choose their own village
 officials. They are eligible to vote in Greek Cypriot elections but must travel to the
 south to exercise that right.
 In both communities, women hold cabinet-level and other senior positions. In the
 Turkish Cypriot sector, the Supreme Court swore in its first female judge.

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are organizations in both parts of the island that consider themselves
 human rights groups, but they are generally concerned with alleged violations
 against the rights of their communitys members by the other community. Groups
 with a broad human rights msndate include organizations promoting awareness of
 domestic violence and others concerned with alleged police brutality.
 There are no restrictions preventing the formation of human rights groups, and
 representatives of international human rights organizations have access throughout
 the island.
 The Government of Cyprus, which claims a number of Greek Cypriots missing
 during the conflict of 1974, is still in the process of submitting its outstanding cases
 to the United Nations Committee on Missing Persons, although the rate of presen-
 tation accelerated over the first 6 months of 1994. For their part, Turkish Cypriot
 authorities, who claim their own missing persons dating from the intercommunal vi-
 olence beginning in 1963, have submitted virtually all of their cases to the U.N.
 Committee.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Legislation in both communities provides for protection against discrimination
 based on sex, national, racial, or ethnic status, religion, or disability.
 Women.-Throughout Cyprus women generally have the same legal status as
 men. While legal provisions in both communities requiring equal pay for men and
 women performing the same job are effectively enforced, women disproportionately
 fill lower paying jobs.
 There are reports of spouse abuse, and the problem is believed to be si iicant.
 Throughout the island, a growing awareness of domestic violence has led to at-
 tempts to pass laws to safeguard the rights of abused spouses. In the Greek Cypriot
 community, a law enacted in July makes it easier for abused spouses to make com-
 plaints to the police, broadens the categories of evidence admissible in hearings on
 aomestic violence, and establishes a "family adviser," both to monitor court cases
 and to facilitate counseling for the offender. It is widely thought that many sus-
 pected cases of domestic violence do not reach the courts largely because of family
 ressure and the wife's economic dependence on her husband. An organization
 Formed to address the problem of domestic abuse reports an increasing number of
 daily calls over its hot line, although hard statistics are not available. Of the rel-
 atively small portion of cases that are tried in the courts, virtually none results in
 conviction: Only 1 conviction was obtained in the nearly 300 spouse abuse cases
 brought before the courts in 1994.
 In the Greek Cypriot community, women face discrimination that denies them the
 ability to pass on citizenship to their children if they are married to foreign spouses.
 Under existing Cypriot law, only a Greek Cypriot father may transmit citizenship
 to his children automatically or obtain expeditious naturalization for his foreign
 spouse.
 In the Turkish Cypriot community, efforts have focused on improving the status
 of women in divorce proceedings, particularly regarding the rights of women to ob-
 tain property acquired during the period of marriage. In general, divorce is difficult
 for either party to obtain unless it is uncontested.
 The Greek Cypriot community continues to focus on trafficking in female pros-
 titutes, and Parliament has held several hearings on the subject. While inter-
 national trafficking in women, mostly from Eastern Europe or the Far East, has di-
 minished because most of these women can now travel directly to their final des-
 tinations rather than through Cyprus, they continue to be brought as "cabaret ar-
 tistes" into Cyprus. The "artistes are sponsored by the cabaret owners or by agents.
 However, to date there have been few arrests since the women, fearing retaliation
 by their employers, generally do not bring charges. Forcing women into prostitution
 is against Republic of Cyprus law.
 There have been repeated credible reports that women from the Far East, work-
 ing in Cyprus as maids, have been forced to work under inhumane circumstances.
 For example, they have been deprived of their passports and of their right to take
 Sundays off, and in some instances they have not been paid. These women generally
 do not file complaints.
 Children.-Both communities are committed to protect children's rights and wel-
 fare within the context of total available resources.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Both the Government of Cyprus and the
 Turkish Cypriot administration have constitutional or legal bars against discrimina-
 tion. Food, shelter, education, and health care are available to members of beth coin-
 
 
 792
 munities regardless of race, religion, or ethnic background. Nevertheless, Greek
 Cypriots living in the north, predominantly in the Karpass area, are unable to move
 about freely and to change their housing at wilL Some Turkish   yriots living in
 the government-controlled area have claimed they are often harassed by the Greek
 Cypriots, including the police. According to some allegations, they are kept under
 surveillance and uestioned closely about their mevements.
 People With D   i/ities.-Piyuically or otherwise disabled persons have no spe-
 cial protection against discrimination in private sector employment in Cyprus, and
 traditional attitudes are slow to change. In the Greek Cypriot community, disabled
 persons app lying for a public sector position are entitled to preference if they are
 deemed able to perform the required duties and their qualifications equal those of
 other applicants. In the Turkish Cypriot community, regulations require businesses
 to employ 1 disabled person for every 25 positions they fill, although enforcement
 is unreliable. Disabled persons do not appear to be discriminated against in edu-
 cation and the provision of state services. In the Greek Cypriot community, legisla-
 tion mandates that new public buildings and tourist facilities provide access for the
 disabled. The Turkish Cypriot community has not to date enacted legislation to pro-
 vide for such access.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers in   yrus, except for members of the
 police and military forces, have the legal right toafrm and join trade unions of their
 own choosing without prior authorization. In the Greek  priot community, police
 officers also have the right to join associations which have the right to bargain col-
 lectively, although not to strike. More than 82 percent of the Greek Cypriot work
 force belongs to independent trade unions. Approximately 50 to 60 percent of Turk-
 ish Cypriot private sector workers and all public sector workers belong to labor
 unions.
 In the Turkish Cypriot community, union officials have alleged that various firms
 have been successful in establishing "company" organizations and then applying
 pressure on workers to join these unions. Officials of independent labor unions have
 also accused the Turkish Cypriot authorities of creating rival public sector unions
 to weaken the independent unions. The International Labor Organization (ILO) has
 not yet acted upon these complaints. There are no complaints outstanding against
 the Government of Cyprus.
 In both communities, trade unions freely and regularly take stands on public pol-
 icy issues affecting workers and maintain their independence from the Government.
 Two of the major trade unions, one in each community, are closely affiliated with
 political parties. Both of the remaining major unions are independent.
 All workers have the right to strike, and several strikes, usually of short duration,
 took place in 1994. In the northern part of the island, however, a court ruling from
 1978 gives employers an unrestricted right to hire replacement workers in the event
 of a strike, effectively limiting the effectiveness of the right to strike. Authorities
 of both the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities have the power to cur-
 tail strikes in what they deem to be "essential services," although this right is rarely
 used.
 Unions in both parts of Cyprus are able to affiliate with international trade union
 organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain CoUlectively.-By law, trade unions and con-
 federations are free to organize and bargain collectively throughout Cyprus. This is
 observed in practice in the Greek Cypriot community, and most wages and benefits
 are set by freely negotiated collective agreements. However, Greek Cypriot collective
 bargaining agreements are not enforceable under the law. In the rare instances
 when such agreements are believed to have been infringed, the Ministry of Labor
 is called in to investigate the claim. If the Ministry is unable to resolve the dispute,
 the union may call a strike to support its demands. In practice, however, such al-
 leged violations are extremely rare, and there were no reported instances in 1994.
 In the Turkish Cypriot community, where inflation exceeded 100 percent over the
 year, wage levels are reviewed twice a year for the private sector and six times a
 year for public sector workers and a corresponding cost-of-living raise is established.
 A special commission composed of five representatives each from organized labor,
 employers, and the authorities conducts the review. Union leaders contend that pri-
 vate sector employers are able to discourage union activity because enforcement of
 labor and occupational safety regulations is sporadic and penalties for antiunion
 practices are minimal. As in the Greek Cypriot community, parties to a dispute may
 request mediation by the authorities.
 
 
 793
 Small export processing zones exist in Larnaca Port and Famagusta, but the laws
 governing working conditions and actual practice are uniform throughout the coun-
 try-
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law, and no instances of it were reported.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-In both the Greek Cypriot and
 Turkish Cypriot communities, the minimum age for employment of children in an
 "industrial undertaking" is 16. Turkish Cypriots may be employed in apprentice po-
 sitions at age 15. However, in family-run shops it is common to see younger children
 working. Government labor inspectors effectively enforce the law in both commu-
 nities.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legislated minimum wage in the Greek
 Cypriot community, which is reviewed every year, is currently about $380 per
 month for beginning unskilled workers. This amount is insufficient to provide an
 adequate living for a worker and family. All other occupations are covered under
 collective bargaining agreements between trade unions and employers within the
 same economic sector, and the minimum wages set in these agreements are signifi-
 cantly higher than the legislated minimum wage.
 The legislated minimum wage in the Turkish Cypriot area, while subject to fre-
 quent review because of high levels of inflation, is approximately $90 per month at
 exchange rates as of mid-1994. This amount is not adequate to support a worker
 and family, although most workers earn more than the minimum wage.
 A significant percentage of the labor force consists of illegal workers, mostly from
 Turkey. According to some estimates, illegal workers constitute as much as 25 per-
 cent of the total work force in the area under Turkish Cypriot control. There are
 frequent allegations that such workers are subject to mistreatment, including
 nonpayment of wages and threats of deportation.
 In the Greek Cypriot community, the standard workweek is an average of 39'2
 hours in the private sector. In the public sector, it is 3712 hours during the winter
 and 35 hours in the summer. In 1992, however, Greek Cypriot unions won conces-
 sions that will reduce the workweek by one-half hour per year until 1997 when a
 38-hour workweek will be in place for most sectors of the economy. In the Turkish
 Cypriot community, the standard workweek is 38 hours in winter and 36 hours in
 summer. Government labor inspectors effectively enforce these laws.
 Greek Cypriot labor union leaders have complained that occupational and safety
 standards lack important safeguards. Factories are typically licensed by municipali-
 ties rather than by the Government, resulting in an uneven application of environ-
 mental and work safeguards. Under a proposed law, Cypriot occupational and safety
 standards will be brought up to ILO- and European Union-mandated standards, in-
 cluding protection of workers who refuse to work because of unsafe conditions.
 While the law was not enacted in 1994, virtually all key participants in the decision
 supported the bill.
 Occupational safety and health regulations are administered at best sporadically
 in the Turkish Cypriot area. In both areas, a factory inspector processes complaints
 and inspects business in order to ensure that occupational safety laws are observed.
 Turkish Cypriot workers who file complaints do not receive satisfactory legal protec-
 tion and may face dismissal.
