 SRI LANKA
 During its three decades of independence, Sri Lanka
 has maintained an unbroken commitment to democratic
 principles and human rights. Power has changed
 hands in an orderly fashion at each of the six gen-
 eral elections held since 1953. Successive govern-
 ments have successfully implemented policies aimed
 at raising literacy and educational levels, improv-
 ing health and nutritional standards, and re-distri-
 buting income. The Governments have maintained a
 commitment to human rights despite an insurgency and
 two major domestic outbreaks of violence.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is not condoned in Sri Lanka and no instances
 of torture have been reported.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Such treatment or punishment is not imposed in Sri Lanka.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is not practiced. The
 Constitution specifically provides that no person
 shall be arrested, held in custody, imprisoned, or
 detained except in accordance with the law. The present
 Government's actions during the August 1977 violence
 stand as evidence that Sri Lanka is a functioning de-
 mocracy in which the guarantees provided in the Consti-
 tution are carried out in practice. The violence in
 August 1977 between the majority Sinhalese and minority
 Tamil communities snowballed from a minor incident into
 nationwide strife that claimed 150 lives and generated
 50,000 refugees. The Government quelled these dis-
 turbances without resort to declaration of a national
 emergency. Nearly 5,000 persons were arrested under
 
 (406)
 
 
 407
 normal procedures; these people were all brought
 before a magistrate within 24 hours, where they
 were either freed, granted bail or remanded to
 custody. Most were released on bail within a
 few days of their arrest. Almost all of those
 remanded by a magistrate were released on bail
 within one month of their arrest. A small number
 are awaiting trial.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In November 1977, the Government repealed the
 Criminal Justice Commission Act, a special law
 that had altered Sri Lanka's normal judicial pro-,
 cedure of fair public trials. The previous
 Government had passed the Act to try insurgents
 who in 1971 sought by violence to overthrow the
 Government of Prime Minister Bandaranaike. Under
 the Act, a special Criminal Justice Commission
 was empowered to admit evidence inadmissible in
 civil or criminal proceedings, and the Commission's
 verdict was final and nonappealable. Together
 with the November 1977 repeal of the Act, the new
 Government released 137 persons who had been tried
 and sentenced under the Act.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 There are effective legal safeguards against arbi-
 trary invasion of the home, including the require-
 ment that a search warrant be obtained. This right
 can be suspended only if a national emergency is
 declared. The new Government dealt with the August
 1977 violence without declaring an emergency, and
 searches of homes took place only by warrant.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Sri Lanka has a remarkable record in meeting the social
 and economic needs of its people. Health care is
 accessible to all, education is universal, the literacy
 
 
 rate is 85%, life expectancy is 67 years, and the
 government provides food subsidies to the poor.
 These economic and social benefits also are avail-
 able to the approximately one million non-citizen
 Tamils. However, because they will be repatriated
 to India under the terms of 1964 and 1974 agreements
 between Sri Lanka and India, non-citizen Tamils are
 not allowed to participate in the Government's re-
 settlement programs in newly-developed agricultural
 areas.
 Sri Lanka is committed to the creation of a demo-
 cratic socialist state. Income distribution has be-
 come more equitable.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Freedom of thought, speech, publication, religion and
 assembly is guaranteed by the Constitution. While the
 Constitution of 1972 does accord the "foremost place"
 to Buddhism and requires the State "to protect and
 foster Buddhism," there is no indication that in prac-
 tice this works to the detriment of other religions.
 Government censorship is not employed, and publica-
 tions carry on an active discussion of local and inter-
 national affairs. The Government-owned public broad-
 casting corporation permits the expression of differ-
 ing viewpoints. The non-citizens of Sri Lanka enjoy
 the same rights of thought, speech, press, religion
 and assembly as citizens.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of movement within
 the country and the right to choose one's place of
 residence. This right extends equally to citizens and
 non-citizens. Foreign travel and emigration are not
 restricted.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 
 
 409
 As a democracy, Sri Lanka has seen power change hands
 six times since independence in 1948. During the
 recent elections in July 1977, an open campaign was
 conducted; freedom of speech, assembly, and press
 were not abridged. Sri Lanka's citizens expressed
 themselves freely during the election campaign and
 at the polls.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 Sri Lankan Governments generally have been receptive
 to outside investigations. While the previous Govern-
 ment at first welcomed Amnesty International's investi-
 gation of its handling of the detention of insurgents
 in 1971, relations deteriorated as a result of disputes
 over the detention policies then being followed by that
 Government.
