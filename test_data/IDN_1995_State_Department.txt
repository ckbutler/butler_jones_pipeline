 INDONESIA
 The Indonesian political system, des pit a surface adherence to democratic forms,
 remains strongly authoritarian. President Soeharto (now in his sixth 5-year term),
 a small group of advisers, and the military dominate the political life of this heavily
 populated developing country, whose people come from hundreds of different culi-
 tural, linguistic, and ethnic banrunds. The Government requires allegiance to a
 state ideology known as "Pancasila," which includes belief in a Supreme God, a just
 and civilized humanity, national unity, democracy, and social justice. It has used
 Pancasila as a justification for restricting the development of opposition elements.
 Under a doctrine of "dual function," the military is given special civic rights and
 responsibilities, including unelected military seats inParliament (DPR) and local
 legislatures, in addition to its defense and security roles. The 450,000-member
 
 
 613
 armed forces, including 175,000 police, consider the maintenance of internal security
 as their primary mission. They have traditionally acted swiftly to suppress per.
 ceived threats to security, with a vigor that has often led to human ri s abuses.
 Some military leaders have raised questions about the validity of this security ap-
 proach" There continued to be numerous, credible reports of human rights abuses
 by the military and police, although they exhibited some restraint in controlling
 crowds and demonstrations.
 In contrast to its restrictive political system, Indonesia has an increasingly open
 and deregulated economy. Although still a poor country, the economy continued to
 expand, especially in manufacturing, with gross domestic product expected to in-
 crease by 7.2 percent in 1995. The continued economic growth has produced steady
 gains in living standards for much of Indonesian society. The number of people liv-
 ing below the poverty line has fallen from over 60 percent of the population to under
 15 percent. Widespread underemployment persists, however, as do corruption and
 influence peddling.
 The Government continued to commit serious human rights abuses. The most se-
 rious abuses included harsh repression of dissidents in East Timor, Aceh, and Irian
 Jaya. Reports of extrajudicial killings, disappearances, and torture of those in cus-
 tody by security forces increased. Reports of arbitrary arrests and detentions and
 the use of excessive violence (including dendly force) in dealing with suspected
 criminals or perceived troublemakers continued. Prison conditions remained harsh,
 and security forces regularly violated citizens' right to privacy.
 The Indonesian people continue to lack the ability to change their government.
 The Government continued to impose severe limitations on freedoms of speech,
 press, assembly, and association. It suppressed efforts to develop a truly free trade
 union movement, but encouraged some developments that appear to open the door
 to greater flexibility within the registered trade union federation. Labor organiza-
 tions trying to compete with the official trade union federation were subject to con-
 tinuing harassment and intimidation. Elements of the armed forces continued to be
 responsible for the most serious human rights abuses. Military leaders in some
 cases showed willingness to admit publicly abuses by military personnel and take
 action against them, including in a brutal incident in East Timor. Punishment, how-
 ever, rarely matched the severity of the abuse. The judiciary, while still largely sub-
 servient to the executive branch and subject to widespread corruption, made several
 significant decisions against government interests that suggested somewhat greater
 judicial independence.
 The Government continued to exert strong pressure against antigovenent crit-
 ics, independent journalists, and labor activists. These constraints, however, did not
 complete y dampen dissenting voices in the public and the media. Many human
 rights nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) remained active, and the Govern-
 ment tolerated wide press coverage of same sensitive issues. The Government an-
 nounced a phasing-out of a discriminatory symbol on the identification cards of ex-
 political prisoners and their families, and some easing of restrictions on the right
 of free assembly both beginnin    early 1996. The government-appointed National
 Human Rights Commission displayed increasing independence, spotlighting abuses
 and occasionally taking positions at variance with government policies and actions.
 On East Timer, no progress was made in accounting for the missing persons fol-
 lowing the 1991 Dill incident or the 10 other Timorese that disappeared in 1995.
 Troop levels remained unjustifiably high. The armed forces used excessive force in
 making arrests following anti-integration rioting in Dili in October. The Government
 reimposed restricted access to the province by foreign journalists.
 In Irian Jays, tensions with indigenous inhabitants seeking greater autonomy or
 independence led to violent repressive measures by military units, resulting in
 dets and other human rihts abuses documented by several sources, including the
 National Human Rights     ommission, the Catholic Church, and NGO's. Security
 forces reportedly kilied 16 or maore civilians throughout Iria Jaya between mid-
 1994 and mid-1995.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extra&udicial Killing.-HI-istricaly, politically motivated
 extrajudicial killings generally have occurred most f     reqentin  eas where sepa-
 ratist movements were active, such as East Timor, Aceh, and Irian Jay. Security
 forces continue to employ harsh measures against separatist movements in these
 three areas. Security forces in East Timor killed six unarmed civilians in Liquisa
 province in January. The military court-martialed two soldiers for this killing (see
 below). There were also several other mysterious killings in East Timor; the limited
 
 
 614
 evidence available suggests some of these too could also be cases of summary execu-
 tion by security forces, though at least seven are attributed to East Timorese insur-
 gents. There were credible, detailed reports from church and NGO sources that se-
 curity forces killed 16 or more civilians in Irian Jaya between mid-1994 and mid-
 1995. Knowledgeable sources report at least two unconfi-med instances of security
 forces in Aceh province killing civilians without justification.
 There were reports that security forces killed members of insurgent groups in
 armed clashes, including five Aceh Merdeka supporters in Aceh as well as a number
 of alleged armed opposition members in East Timor. Insurgent groups also attacked
 and killed security forces.
 The Government withdrew two army battalions from East Timor in September,
 but there has been no noticeable decrease in military activity in the territory. After
 October riots in Dili, some antiriot units were reinforced. The Government offered
 a general amnesty to members of the Timorese resistance who surrender their arms,
 and it was reported to have released some who were apprehended rather than put
 them on trial. A similar policy was applied to several leaders of the Timorese Clan-
 destine Political Movement.
 The police often employ excessive and sometimes deadly force in apprehending
 suspects or coping with alleged criminals. In response to protests that the methods
 used are unjustifiably harsh and amount to execution without trial, police generally
 claim that the suspects were fleeing, resisting arrest, or threatening the police. In
 North Sumatra, for example, 45 shootings by police, including 3 deaths, were re-
 ported by mid-August. Accurate statistics were unavailable, however.
 In the past the authorities almost never took action against police for using exces-
 sive force. However, there is some indication that this situation is improving, al-
 though action taken by the authorities is still not commensurate with the gravity
 of police abuses. Among a number of disciplinary actions taken by authorities, three
 policemen were reported to be facing court-martial in Padang, West Sumatra, on
 charges of deliberately striking a motorcyclist with their car during a chase in April
 although the trial had not begun as of late August. In June a military court-martial
 sentenced an army second lieutenant to 4 and 2/2 years in prison and a private to
 4 years for killing six unarmed, bound civilians in Liquisa Regency, East Timor in
 January. In October military authorities arrested a second lieutenant and three pri-
 vates suspected of killing civilians in Irian Jaya (see above), and planned to court-
 martial them beginning in January 1996. Seven policemen were detained in Aceh
 Province on suspicion of torturing a suspected rapist and causing his death in late
 July. In Northern Sumatra, at least two civil cases of alleged excessive force on the
 part of police officials, in one of which the victim died, were settled out of court
 trough monetary compensation.
 b. Disappearance.-There were credible reports that security forces abducted five
 civilians m Dii, East Timer, in January. The Government did not respond to re-
 peated requests from the National Human Rights Commission and from foreign gov-
 ernments to clarify the fate of these persons. At least five other persons disappeared
 in East Timor under circumstances suggesting possible involvement by the security
 forces, and some credible sources believe they have been executed. Indonesian
 NGO's documented reports of at least four civilians who disappeared after being de-
 tained by military forces in Irian Jaya at the end of 1994. The whereabouts of those
 abducted are not known, and credible sources believe they are dead. Security forces
 did not acknowledge the abductions, but announced that they were investigating the
 Irian Jaya reports and related charges of military killings and torture in that prov-
 ince. Since their investigation of the Liquisa incident in East Timor in January, se-
 curity forces have become less willing to provide information or to undertake inves-
 tigations about new cases of concern. Security forces in areas of conflict sometimes
 hold suspects incommunicado for periods of time before acknowledging their deten-
 tion. This appears to have become more frequent in East Timor during the latter
 part of 1994 and early 1995, before easing somewhat later in the year. Suspects are
 also frequently held for substantial periods of time without formal charges being
 brought.
 The Government made no new efforts to account for the missing and dead from
 the November 12, 1991 military shooting of civilians in Dili, East Timor. Of those
 still listed as missing in a report the military gave to Human Rights Watch/Asia,
 no additional cases were resolved during the year. Government spokesmen implied
 that their failure to locate those missing was primarily due to those persons wishing
 to evade detection. Many knowledgeable observers, however, continued to believe
 that most of the missing are dead and that some members of the armed forces know
 where their bodies are located.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Criminal Code makes it a crime punishable by up to 4 years in prison for any
 
 
 615
 official to use violence or force to elicit a confession, and it establishes pretrial proce-
 dures to give suspects or their families the right to challenge the legality of an ar-
 rest or detention. In practice, legal protections are both inadequate and widely ig-
 nored, and security forces continued to employ torture and other forms of mistreat-
 ment, particularly in regions of security concerns such as Aceh, Irian Jaya, and East
 Timor.
 In August NGO and church sources provided eyewitness accounts to the National
 Human Rights Commission of over 40 victims of alleged torture by military person-
 nel in Irian Jaya in late 1994 and early 1995. According to these sources, methods
 of torture employed included kicking with heavy boots; beating with fists, sticks,
 stones, and nifle butts; starvation; shackling thumbs, arms and legs; taping eyes
 shut; stamping on hands; and forcing victims to stand for prolonged periods while
 bearing heavy weights or to kneel with an iron bar in the knee hollow. In East
 Timor, torture increased in friquency beginning in November 1994, and included
 electric shocks, mock execution, severe beatings, and burning with cigarettes. Fol-
 lowing complaints, this problem appears to have eased in the case of the provincial
 police, but continued or worsened in detention facilities run by military intelligence.
 Police often resort to physical abuse, even in minor incidents. Prison conditions
 are harsh, with violence among prisoners and mistreatment and extortion of in-
 mates by guards reportedly common. The incidence of mistreatment by prison offi-
 cials drops sharply once a prisoner has been transferred from police or military cus-
 tody into the civilian prison system, and prison conditions generally have improved
 in recent years. Sporadic cases of ill-treatment have been reported in East Timorese
 prisons. Officials have publicly condemned police brutality and harsh prison condi-
 tions and occasionally instigate disciplinary action, including transfer, dismissal,
 and trials leading to prison. Such actions, however, are an exception to the rule of
 general impunity. Political prisoners are usually mixed with the general prison pop-
 ulation, although in the Cipinang Prison in Jakarta high-profile political prisoners
 are segregated. In 1995 the Government allowed the International Committee of the
 Red Cross (ICRC) to visit prisoners in Cipinang in Jakarta and also granted access
 to prisons elsewhere in Jays, Sumatra, Aceh, and other provinces as well as East
 Timor. The Government also has allowed the ICRC to organize family visits to polit-
 ical prisoners. Authorities allowed visiting diplomatic officials or NGO representa-
 tives to visit East Timor prisoners of their choosing on at least two occasions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Criminal Procedures Code contains
 provisions against arbitrary arrest and detention which are routinely violated. The
 ode spcifies the right of prisoners to notify their families, and that warrants must
 be produced during an arrest except under specified conditions, such as when a sus-
   is caught in the act of ommitting a crime. It also authorizes investigators to
 issue warrants to assist in their investigations or if sufficient evidence exists that
 a crime has been committed. Despite these requirements, authorities sometimes
 make arrests without warrants. Security forces reportedly arrested members of the
 Alliance of Independent Journalists in March before formal warrants were issued
 (see Section 2.a.). The number of persons detained at least temporarily without war-
 rant by security forces in East Timor increased during late 1994 and 1995.
 The law presumes defendants innocent and permits bail. They or their families
 may also challenge the legality of their arrest and detention in a pretrial hearing
 and may sue for compensation if wrongfully detained. However, it is virtually impos-
 sible for detainees to invoke this procedure, let alone receive compensation, after
 being released without charge. In both military and civilian courts, appeals based
 on legality of arrest and detention are rarely, if ever, accepted. The Code also con-
 tains specific limits on periods of pretrial detention and specifies when the courts
 must get involved to approve extensions, usually after 60 days. In areas where ac-
 tive guerrilla movements exist such as East Timor, Irian Jays, and Aceh, people are
 routinely detained without warrants, charges, or court proceedings. Bail is rarely
 granted, especially in political cases. The authorities frequently prevent access to
 defense counsel and make it difficult or impossible for detainees to get legal assist-
 ance from voluntary legal defense organizations. The authorities routinely approve
 extensions of periods of detention. In addition, suspects charged under the 1963
 Antisubversion Law are subject to special procedures outside the Criminal Proce-
 dures Code which allow, for example, the Attorney General the authority to hold
 a suspect up to 1 year before trial. He may renew this 1-year period without limit.
 Special laws on corruption, economic crimes, and narcotics are similarly exempt
 from the Code's protections.
 The Agency for Coordination of Assistance for the Consolidation of National Secu-
 rity (BAKORSTANAS) operates outside the Code and has wide discretion to detain
 and interrogate persons thought to threaten national security. It is impossible to
 state the exact number of arbitrary arrests or detentions without trial, particularly
 
 
 616
 in Aceh and Irian Jaya. In 1995 authorities released at least 64 supposed Aceh
 Merdeka supporters who were being held without trial, bringing the total number
 of accused Aceh Merdeka supporters released since 1990 to around 1,000 persons.
 Many had been held incommunicado without knowing the charges against them;
 some had been held for over 2 years. The authorities often require those released
 to report back at regular intervals, but in May 916 former detainees were relieved
 of this obligation. In East Timor, military authorities continued the practice of de-
 taining people without charges for short periods and then requiring them to report
 daily or weekly to police after their release. About 100 people were detained without
 charge during demonstrations and outbreaks of violene in Dili around the time of
 the November 1994 Asian Pacific Economic Cooration (APEC) meetings. Deten-
 tions continued during further disturbances in December 1994 and January 1995.
 The authorities eventually charged and sentenced some of these detainees for in-
 volvement in civil disturbances or antigovernment prtests, including at least eight
 East Timorese who reeived prison sentenes of 12 to 30 months. Five other East
 Timorese, widely considered wrongly accused, were sentened to 5 months' imprison-
 ment for involvement in mysterious nighttime incidents of harassment, beating, and
 fearmongering by persons termed "ninjas." More than 200 persons were arrested in
 additional disturbances in September and October 1995. Authorities have an-
 nounced that several dozen will be put on trial.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution stipulates the independence of
 the judiciary, but in practice the judiciary is subordinated to the executive and the
 military, and in many cases procedural protections, including those against coerced
 confessions, are inadequate to ensure a fair trial.
 A quadripartite judiciary of general, religious, military, and administrative courts
 exists below the Supreme Court. The right of appeal from district court to high court
 to Supreme Court exists in all four systems ofjustice. The Supreme Court does not
 consider factual aspects of a case, only the lower courts' application of law. A panel
 of judges conducts trials at the district court level, poses questions, hears evidence,
 decides guilt or innocence, and assesses punishment. While there were some signifi-
 cant exceptions in 1995, initial judgments are rarely reversed in the appeals proc-
 ess, although sentences are sometimes increased or reduced (both the defense and
 the prosecution may appeal).
 In January the 3-year sentence of independent Labor leader Muchtar Pakpahan
 was increased by the high court to 4 years, but the Supreme Court later overturned
 his conviction (see below). The sentence of Amosi Telaumbanua, another union lead-
 er, was raised from 15 months to 3 years (later reversed by the Supreme Court, see
 below.) Defendants have the right to confront witnesses and to produce witnesses
 in their defense. An exception is allowed in cases in which distance or expense is
 deemed excessive for transporting witnesses to court. In such cases, sworn affidavits
 may be introduced. However, the Criminal Procedures Code does not provide for
 witnesses' immunity or for compulsory process of defense witnesses. As a result, wit-
 nesses are sometimes too afraid of retribution to testify against the authorities.
 In cases tried under the 1963 Antisubversion Law, trials in absentia are per-
 mitted and public access generally requires advance approval by the military. The
 courts commonly allow forced confessions and limit the presentation of defense evi-
 dence. Defendants do not have the right to remain silent and can be compelled to
 testify in their own trials. The Criminal Procedures Code gives defendants the right
 to an attorney from the moment of their arrest through the investigation and trial.
 The law requires that a lawyer be appointed in capital cases and those involving
 a prison sentence of 15 years or more. In cases involving potential sentences of 5
 years or more, a lawyer must be appointed if the defendant desires an attorney and
 is indigent. In theory, destitute defendants may obtain private legal help, such as
 that provided by the Legal Aid Institute. In practice, however, defendants are often
 persuaded not to hire an attorney, or access to an attorney of their choice is im-
 peded. The military held five alleged Aceh Merdeka members, who were sentenced
 i early 1995 (see elow), for up to a year without access to attorneys; the authori-
 ties did not allow them to chose their attorneys, and those appointed by the court
 could not see the defendants until just before the trial.
 The Supreme Court theoretically stands coequal with the executive and legislative
 branches, but it does not have the right of judicial review over laws passed by Par-
 liament. The Supreme Court has not yet exercised its power (held since 1985) to
 review ministerial decrees and regulations. In 1993 Chief Justice Purwoto
 Gandasubrata laid out procedures for limited judicial review. Judges are civil serv-
 ants employed by the executive branch, which controls their assignments, pay, and
 promotion. They are subject to considerable pressure from military and other gov-
 ernmental authorities. Such pressure often determines the outcome of a case, and
 
 
 617
 
 was widely suspected of being behind an attempt by the Chief Justice to thwart the
 implementation of a Supreme Court ruling against the government of Irian Jaya in
 a.and compensation dispute. Corruption permeates the leal system. In civil and
 crminal cases, the payment of bribes can influence prosecution, conictin, and sen-
 tencing. To address judicial corruption, the Government doubled judges' salaries in
 1995.
 Several important court decisions against the Government in 1995 may be a sign
 of nascent judicial independence. In February the Supreme Court commuted the
 1993 sentene of an Acehnese serving 5 years for sub~version and ordered his re-
 lease. It also upheld the appeals court's quashing of the conviction of the alleged
 mastermind in the 1993 murder of labor activist Marsinaa and overturned his con-
 viction. It also reversed the remaining eight civilians' convictions as well for insuffi-
 cient evidence, indirectly vindicating charges by the National Human Rights Com-
 mission and some NGO s that their confessions had been coerced. In May the Su-
 preme Court provisionally released convicted labor leader Muchtar Pakpahan pend-
 ing a decision on his appeal under a seldom honored provision of the Penal Code,
 and later overturned his conviction. It also reversed the high court decision that in-
 creased Amosi Telaumbanua's sentence from 15 to 36 months (see above). An ad-
 ministrative court in Jakarta found in favor of the plaintiffs, employees of the
 banned periodical Tempo, in their civil suit against the inister of Justice for revok-
 ing Tempo's publication license in 1993. The High Court unanimously upheld this
 decision in November, stating that the ministerial regulations permitting publica-
 tions to be banned were in onflict with p ress freedoms ontained in the Constitu-
 tion. The Government has appealed the High Court ruling to the Supreme Court.
 The Antisubversion Law, which carries a maximum penalty of death makes it a
 crime to engage in acts that could distort, undermine, or deviate from tie state ide-
 ology or broad outlines of state policy, or which could disseminate feelings of hos-
 tility or arouse hostility, disturbances, or anxiety among the population. The exces-
 sively vague langiage of this law makes it possible to prosecute people merely for
 peaceful expression of views contraiy to those of the Government. In Aceh province,
 authorities sentenced at least five accused Aceh Merdeka supporters under the
 Antisubversion Law to 6 to 20 years in prison (see Section i.e.).
 The Government does not make avail able statistics on the number of people cur-
 rently serving subversion sentences or sentences classified as felonies under the so-
 called Hate-Sowing or Sedition laws. President Soeharto granted clemency in Au-
 gust to three former high officials, Subandrio, Omar Dhani, and Sugeng Sutarto,
 who were serving life sentences in connection with the abortive Communist coup in
 1965. Six prisoners convicted of subversio n  past years remained under death sen-
 tene. In A        cugust the authorities announced that two of them  whose appeals for
 clemency were denied by the President, were soon to be executed, but the executions
 had not been csrried out as ofyear's end.
 Different sources estimate the number of people serving sentences for subversion
 in 1995, including members of the banned Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI),
 Muslim militants, and those convicted of subversion in Irian Jaya, Aceh, and East
 Timor, at between 250 and 350. Scores, and possibly hundreds, more were believed
 to be serving sentences under the Hate-Sowing or Sedition laws. Some of these per-
 sons advocated or employed violence, but many are political prisoners who were con-
 victed for attempting to exercise such universally recognized human rights as free-
 dom of speech or association or who were convicted in manifestly unfair trials. The
 courts sentenced three members of the Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI)
 and a fourth underground journalist to prison terms of 20 to 36 months under the
 Hate-Sowing articles (see Section 2.a). In SeJptember a court sentenced a well-known
 psychic to 7 months in jail under the articles for blasphemy against Islam in a
 closed academic seminar in April (see Section 2.A.). In Februay a district court in
 Malang, East Java sentenced Jose Antonio Neves to 4 years in prison on charges
 of sedition for advocating East Timorese independence and accusing the army of
 human rights violations in letters to international organizations.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Judicial
 warrants for searches are required except for cases involving suspected subversion,
 economic crimes, and corruption. However security agencies regularly make forced
 or surreptitious entries. They also intimidate by surveillance of persons and resi-
 dences and selective monitoring of local and international telephone calls without
 legal restraint. Government security officials monitor the movements and activities
 of-former members of the PMI and its front organizations, especially persons the
 Government believes were involved in the abortive 1965 Communist-backed coup.
 These persons and their relatives sometimes are subject to surveillance, required
 check-ins, periodic indoctrination, and restrictions on travel outside their citX of res-
 idence. Their legally required identification cards carry the initials "E.T. which
 
 
 618
 stand for 'Ex-Tapol,* or former political prisoner. This readily identifies them to
 prospective employers or government officials and subjects them to various forms of
 official and unofficial discrimination. The number of persons bearing E.T. on their
 identification cards totaled 1,352,896 in 1992, according to the Government. The
 Government announced that it would phase out the use of E.T. in the process of
 introducing a new type of identification card beginning in early 1996, while leaving
 other forms of monitoring and control in place.
 The Government has in recent years significantly reduced its transmigration pro-
 ram   which moves large numbers of people from overpopulated islands to more iso-
 ated and backward ones. The program is criticized by human rights monitors who
 say that it not only sometimes violates the rights of indigenous people but also those
 of some of the transmigrants who claim that they are duped into leaving their home
 villages without any means of return.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Government restrictions on press freedom con-
 tinued, following the revocation of the publishing licenses of three well-known news-
 magazines the previous year. In May former employees of Tempo, one of the banned
 periodicals, won a lawsuit against the Minister of Information in administrative
 court contesting the revocation; the Government lost its appeal of the decision to
 a higher court, but has appealed to the Supreme Court.
 Although the Constitution and the 1982 Press Law provide for freedom of the
 press, the issuance of publishing licenses under a 1984 ministerial decree is one
 method the Government uses to control the press. Other means of control include
 regulation of the amount of advertising permitted and of the number of pages al-
 lowed in newspapers. Authorities continued in same cases to issue instructions,
 more or less subtle, to local journalists on what they could print. The practice of
 telephoning editors to caution against publishing certain stories-the so-called tele-
 phone culture--continued. In August the Attorney General warned in a press con-
 ference that newspaprs carrying speculative stories about the rumored existence of
 a Soekarno-era Revolution Fund risked criminal charges. Authorities also warned
 editors to end coverage of the Minister of Information's alleged public misreading
 of Koranic verses, which had caused a public outcry, and temporarily banned the
 Sunday edition ofZ a Jakarta daily newspaper for carrying stories on sensitive sub-
 jects. Self-censorship continued to be another publicly acknowledged brake on free
 expression. In Medan, coverage of sensitive issues such as work stoppages and peas-
 ant protests against land clearance operations has remained at a low level since the
 press bannings of June 1994.
 In March the Government struck against two of the unlicensed underground pub-
 lications which had appeared in defiance of goverment attempts to limit free and
 open news reporting. Police arrested the editor of "Kabar Dari Pijar" and three per-
 sons associated with the Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI), which publishes
 the underground bulletin "Independen." They were tried and sentenced for sowing
 hatred against the Government (see Section i.e.). AJI was formed to work for press
 freedom in 1994 by journalists outraged by the Government's revocation that year
 of the publication licenses of three periodicals.
 The government-controlled Association of Indonesian Journalists (PWI) expelled
 13 AJI members, and the Government threatened licensed periodicals with sanc-
 tions if they employed journalists not affiliated with the PWI. Active opposition to
 the new government press measures still continued, however. Independen and a
 number of other unsanctioned journals continued to publish, providing critical cov-
 erage of controversial issues to a limited audience mainly in major cities. Vigorous
 debate on a number of sensitive topics such as corruption, collusion, the role of the
 first family in business, and lack of government accountability for funds expended
 rebounded during 1995, particularly in the English language press. However, major
 Indonesian language newspapers remain cautious in covering controversial subjects
 and the statements of prominent critics of the Government.
 While public dialog is more free than it was a number of years ago, the Govern-
 ment continues to impose restrictions on free speech. Bandung authorities prohib-
 ited noted poet W. S. Rendra from reading some of his poems at a fund-raising
 event, although he had been allowed to read them earlier in Surabaya. In March
 the authorities withdrew permission for "recalled" Unity Development Party (PPP)
 legislator Sri Bintang Pamungkas to address a seminar on economics at Garut, East
 Java. Pamungkas was one of two legislators withdrawn or recalled from Parliament
 by their parties (the other was from the government-controlled GOLKAR organiza-
 tion-see Section 3) for their outspoken criticisms of the Government. The police
 also investigated Pamungkas on various charges related to his alleged involvement
 in protests against President Soeharto during the President's April visit to Germany
 
 
 619
 and at year's end were trying him on charges of insulting the President during a
 speech he made in Germany. In April Medan police briefly detained and questioned
 but did not chare eight student protestors for allegedly slandering President
 Soeharto. In May the Jakar office o the Directorate of Social and Political Affairs,
 which together with several other government entities must give approval for theat-
 rical performances, blocked a permit for a workers' theater group to perform a play
 in the capital about exploitation of factory workers. In Septembr Jakarta police
 preventeda different group from staging another play on a labor theme for which
 authorities had already granted pernussion.
 The electronic media remained more cautious in their coverage of the Government
 than the print media. The Government operates the nationwide television network,
 which has 12 regional stations. Private commercial television companies, many with
 ownership or management ties to the President's family, continued to expand. All
 are required to broadcast government-prduced news, but many also produce public
 affairs style programming that borders on news.
 Over 600 private radio broadcasting companies exist in addition to the Govern-
 ment's national radio network. They are allrequired to belong to the government-
 sponsored Association of Private Radio Stations (PRSSNI) to receive a broadcasting
 liense. The government radio station produces "National News," which is by law
 the only radio news broadcast in Indonesia, and it is relayed throughout the country
 by the private stations and 49 regional affiliates of the Government station. By law,
 the private radio stations may produce only "light" news, such as human interest
 stories, and may not discuss politics. In practice, however, many broadcast inter-
 views and foreign news as well. However, government pressure resulted in one talk
 show on the private station SCTV being taken off the air for covering sensitive sub-
 jects.
 Foreign television and radio broadcasts are readily accessible to those who can af-
 ford the expensive technology, and satellite dishes have proliferated throughout the
 country. The Government makes no efforts to restrict access to this programming,
 and has proclaimed an "open skies" policy, although more and more signals are
 being scrambled by broadcasters for commercial reasons.
 The Government closely regulates access to Indonesia, particularly to certain
 areas of the country, by visiting and resident foreign correspondents and occasion-
 ally reminds the latter of its prerogative to deny requests for visa extensions. The
 Government requires a permit for the importation of foreign publications and video
 tapes, which must be reviewed by government censors. Importers sometimes avoid
 foreign materials critical of the Goverment or dealing with topics considered sen-
 sitive, such as human rights. Foreign publications are widely available.
 Special permission is necessary for foreign journalists to travel to East Timor,
 Ace, and-lan    aya. The Government organized at least one gup journalist trip
 to East Timor. Approval for individual trips by journalists to the province, and for
 travel outside Dili (the capital), became more restrictive, with a number of journal-
 ists repeatedly requesting permission, without success, to visit the province.
 While the law provides for academic freedom, constraints exist on the activities
 of scholars. Political activity and discussions at universities, while no longer for-
 mally banned, remained constrained. In September a court sentenced a psychic to
 7 months in prison for remarks he made about the prophet Mohammed in an aca-
 demic seminar, but it provisionally released him from custody the next day.
 Scholars sometimes refrain from producing or including in lectures and class dis-
 cussions materials that they believe might provoke government displeasure. Pub-
 lishers sometimes refuse to accept manuscripts dealingwith controversial issues. On
 occasion the Government bans publications and boo s outright. In February the
 Central Java government ordered a new edition of the book Cerita Dar Blora," by
 the prominent Indonesian novelist and former political prisoner Pramoedya Anata
 Toer, which had been banned in 1976, withdrawn from bookstores, and in April the
 Attorney General ordered the withdrawal of his book "Nyani Sunyi Seorang Bisu"
 from sale. Most of Pramoedya's works are banned in Indonesia.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. The Government places significant controls on
 the exercise of this right, but announced an easing of the restrictions which are still
 not promulgated. Until 1995 public meetings of five or more persons, as well as aca-
 denc or other seminars and marches and demonstrations, required permits from
 the police and several government agencies. While obtaining such approval was usu-
 ally routine, the authorities occasionally arbitrarily and inconsistent y withheld per-
 mission or broke up peaceful gatherings for which no permit had been obtained. The
 press reported 5 instances of authorities dnyingpermits and 26 cases of dispersing
 unauthorized meetings in the first 8 months of 1995. In January a 1-day seminar
 on the Antisubversion Law at the Jakarta office of the regal Aid Foundation, in
 
 
 620
 which members of the National Human Rights Commission participated, narrowly
 averted being closed by the police, who remained on the premises in force during
 the session. Authorities in Jakarta and Semarang broke up May 1 International
 Labor Day demonstrations by students protesting government labor policies, and ar-
 rested 13 demonstrators in Medan who were protesting government investigation of
 prominent dissidents accused of taking part in demonstrations against President
 Soeharto in Dresden. The East Java government repeatedly denied permission to
 the head of the PDI party to meet with party chapters and hold public rallies in
 that province. In June Jakarta authorities forcibly dispersed an unauthorized semi-
 nar on Islam and charged its organizer with holding a public gathering without a
 permit. If convicted, he faces a maximum 4-year sentence.
 In response to growing public criticism of the permit process, including from the
 National Human Rights Commission, the Government in June dropped the permit
 requirement for university approved on-campus scientific seminars. On August 30,
 the Government announced tat regulations requiring permits for other types of
 meetings would be liberalized by the end of the year, to take effect in early 1996.
 In December the Government promulgated regulations governing public gatherings
 which stipulate that gatherings which are social, cultural, religious, or scientific in
 character-as well as activities held in private premises-do not require a permit
 from or advance notification to the police. Seven days prior notice must be given
 to the police before sociopolitical organizations hold political meetings, and for any
 meetings which will discuss political issues or which aspire to influence public pol-
 icy. Such meetings will not, however, require permits. Permits are still required for
 public festivities, fairs, carnivals, parades, and rallies. Such events are assumed to
 have been authorized at least 3 days prior to the scheduled date for the event. The
 new regulations do not govern activities considered to be demonstrations.
 The 1985 Social Organizations Law (ORMAS) requires the adherence of all orga-
 nizations, including recognized religions and associations, to the official ideology of
 Pancasila. This provision, which limits political activity, is widely understood as de-
 signed to inhibit activities of groups seeking to make Indonesia an Islamic state, re-
 vive communism, or return the country to a situation of partisan ideological divi-
 sion. This law empowers the Government to disband any organization it believes to
 be acting against Pancasila and requires prior government approval for any organi-
 zation's acceptance of funds from foreign donors, thereby hindering the work of
 many local humanitarian organizations. Nevertheless, a significant number of orga-
 nizations, including the independent labor organization Serikat Buruh Sejahtera  -
 donesia (SBSI), continue to be active without official recognition under this law (see
 Section 6).
 In the past few years, NGO's have proliferated in such fields as human rights,
 the environment, development, and consumer protection. In general, the Govern-
 ment has given them rather wide latitude to pursue their ains, including public
 criticism of government policies and in some cases lawsuits against the Government.
 The Government seems to have quietly shelved a 1994 draft presidential decree
 similar to the ORMAS Law that would have brought the more than 700 NGO's
 under more stringent controls. However, there remain limits on certain types of
 NGO activities, and authorities reacted forcefully against certain NGO's participat-
 ing in labor demonstrations or publishing unlicensed newsletters. The Government
 reacts particularly negatively to NGO leaders and others who criticize its policies
 when abroad.
 c. Freedom of Re igion.-The Constitution provides for religious freedom and belief
 in one Supreme God. The Government recognizes Islam, Catholicism, Protestantism,
 Buddhism, and Hinduism, and permits the practice of the mystical, traditional be-
 liefs of "Aliran Kepercayaan." Although the population is overwhelmingly Muslim,
 the practice and teachings of the other recognized religions are generally respected,
 and the Government actively promotes mutual tolerance and harmony among them.
 However, some restrictions on certain types of religious activity exist.
 Because the first tenet of Pancasila is belief in one Supreme God, atheism is for-
 bidden. The legal requirement to adhere to Pancasila extends to all religious and
 secular organizations. The Government strongly opposes Muslim groups which advo-
 cate establishing an Islamic state or acknowledging only Islamic law and in the fall
 announced large scale questioning and several arrests of people in Central Java al-
 leged to advocate the establishment of an Islamic state. There are government pro-
 cedures for banning religious sects in Indonesia. Among those prohibited are Jeho-
 vah's Witnesses, Baha'i, and in some provinces the Messianic Islamic sect Darul
 Arqam. The Government closely monitors Islamic sects considered in danger of devi-
 ating from orthodox tenets, and in the past has on occasion dissolved such _rups.
 Violence between rival factions in the Huria Kristen Batak Protestan (HKBP), In-
 donesia's largest Protestant church, continued in North Sumatra throughout 1995,
 
 
 with at least one fatality. In early 1993, citing a threat to civil order, the northern
 Sumatra regional military commander intervened in an internal leadership dispute
 which broke out within the HKBP the previous year, appointing a new bishop and
 helping the new bishop's supporters take over church property. Civilian and military
 authorities have called the dispute an internal church matter that should be re-
 solved by the HKBP members themselves. For the most part, only supporters of the
 former bishop have been prosecuted for acts of violence despite evidence that mem-
 bers of the opposing faction engaged in violent acts as well. In late 1995, however,
 authorities for the fist time took action against some partisans of the new bishop
 as well.
 High level officials continued to make public statements emphasizing the impor-
 tance of respect for religious diversity in the country, particularl foll owing inci-
 dents of religious tension in areas such as Flores, East and West Timor, andparts
 of Java. Lower level officials, however, are frequently alleged to be reluctant to fa-
 ciitate and p0rotect the rights of reigious minorities. There was an outbreak of reli-
 gion-based violence in East Timor in September and October. In early September,
 Timorese burned markets and damaged several mosques following reports that an
 Indonesian official made derogatory comments about Catholicism. The official in
 question has been sentenced to 4 years, 10 months in prison. Several Protestant
 churches were also burned in September, sparked by the celebration of a religiously
 mixed marriage. Clashes in moid-Otober between security forces and groups of
 youths led to extensive damage, at least 2 deaths, and 151 arrests. There as been
 an Islamic backlash on Java calling for the defense of Muslims in East Timor. Prop-
 erty was destroyed and members of the Chinese community harassed in separate
 incidents in Pekalongan and Purworkerto, Central Java, following incidents in
 which Chinese individuals were believed to have insulted Islamic traditions.
 The law allows conversion between faiths, and such conversions occur. Marriages
 between persons of different religions are allowed. The Government views pros-
 elytiing by the recognized religions in areas heavily dominated by one recognized
 religion or another as potentially disruptive and discourages it. Foreign missionary
 activities are relatively unimpeded, although in East Timor and occasionally else-
 where missionaries have experienced difficulties and delays in renewing residence
 permits, and visas allowing the entrance of new foreign clergy are difficult to obtain.
 Laws and decrees from the 1970's limit the number of years foreign missionaries
 can spend in Indonesia, with some extensions granted in remote areas like Irian
 Jaya.Foreign missionary work is subject to the unding stipulations of the ORMAS
 Law (see Section 2.b.). Indonesians practicing the recognized religions maintain ac-
 tive links with coreligionists inside and outside the country and travel abroad for
 religious gatherings.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Although in 1993 the Government drastically reduced the number of
 people barred either from entering or depart ing Indonesia from a publicly an-
 nounced figure of 8,897 "blacklisted" people to a few hundred, such restrictions still
 exist. The Government banned ousted Parliament member Sri Bintang Pamunkas
 from traveling abrcad while investigating his earlier activities in Germany (see Sec-
 tion 2.a.). The Government has appealed a State Administrative Court decision in
 December that the ban is illegal. Novelist Pramoedya Anata Toer was unable to
 travel to the Philippines to accept a literary award from the Magsaysay Foundation.
 The Government also restricts movement by Indonesian and foreign citizens to and
 within parts of Indonesia. In addition, it requires permits to seek work in a new
 location in certain areas, primarily to control further population movement to
 crowded cities. Special permits are required to visit certain parts of Irian Jaya. The
 military carried out security checks affecting transportation and travel to and with-
 in East Timor sporadically in 1995, and it occasionally imposed curfews in connec-
 tion with military operations. The authorities require former political detainees, in-
 cluding those associated with the abortive 1965 coup, to give notice of their move-
 ments and to have official permission (see Section L.f.) to change their place of resi-
 dence.
 In past years the Government admitted large numbers of asylum seekers from
 Indochina. Only a relatively small number now remain, and the Government contin-
 ues to work with Vietnam under a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding signed
 in 1993 with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to repatriate
 peacefully the remaining asylum seekers to Vietnam.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the ability to change their government through democratic
 means. The 1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), which is constitu-
 
 
 tionally the highest authority of the State and meets every 5 years to elect the
 President and Vice President and set the broad outlines of state policy, is controlled
 by the Government through the appointment of half its membership. The remaining
 half come from the National Parliament (DPR), 80 percent of whose members are
 elected. In 1993 the MPR elected Soeharto to his sixth uncontested 5-year term as
 President. Legally, the President is constitutionally subordinate to the Parliament,
 but actually he and a small group of active duty and retired military officers and
 civilian officials exercise governmental authority.
 Under a doctrine known as dual function, the military assumes a significant socio-
 political as well as a security role. Members of the military are allotted unelected
 seats in the DPR. In 1995 the Government legislated a reduction in the number of
 these seats from 100 to 75, or 15 percent of a total of 500, effective 1997. The mili-
 tary will continue to hold an unelected 20 percent of the seats in provincial and dis-
 trict parliaments, and to occupy numerous key positions in the administration. The
 other 85 percent of national and 80 percent of local parliamentary seats are filled
 through elections held every 5 years. All adult citizens, except active duty members
 of the armed forces, convicted criminals serving prison sentences, and some 36,000
 former members of the Communist Party, are eligible to vote. Voters choose by se-
 cret ballot between    three government-apprved political organizations, which
 field candidate lists in each electoral district. Those lists must be screened by
 BAKORSTANAS (see Section 1.d.), which determines whether candidates were m-
 volved in the abortive 1965 Communist coup or pose other broadly defined security
 risks. Critics charge these screenings are unconstitutional, since there is no way to
 appeal the results, and note that they can be used to eliminate critics of the Govern-
 ment from Parliament.
 Strict rules establish the length of political campaigns, access to electronic media,
 schedules for public appearances, and the political symbols that can be used. The
 Government permits only three political organizations to exist and contest elections.
 The largest and most important of thes is GOLKAR, a government-controlled orga-
 nization of diverse functional groups which won 68 percent of the seats in the 1992
 elections. The President strongly influences the selection of the leaders of GOLKAR.
 The other two small political organizations, the Unity Development Party (PPP) and
 the Democratic Party of Indonesia (PDI), split the remaining vote. The law requires
 all three political organizations to embrace Pancasila, and none of the organizations
 is onsidered an opposition p arty. Government authorities closely scrutinize and
 often guide their activities. Members of the DPR and the prvincial assemblies may
 be recalled from office by party leaders. In 1995 both GOLKAR and PPP recalled
 legislators who were considered too outspoken.
 GOLKAR maintains close institutions links with the armed force s and KORPRI,
 the association to which all civil servants automatically belong. Civil servants may
 join any of the political parties with official permission, but most are members of
 GOLKAR. Former members of the Ps and some other banned parties may not run
 for office or be active politically. The DPR considers bills presented to it by govern-
 ment departments and agencies but does not drt laws on its own, although it has
 the onstitstional right to do so. The DPR makes technical and occasionally sub-
 stantive alterations to bills it reviews. In practice, it remains clearly subordinate to
 the executive branch, but recently it has become more active in scrutinizing govern-
 ment policy, and exercising oversight of government budgetary expenditures and
 program implementation through hearings at which members of the Cabinet, mili-
 tary  ommanders, and other high officials are asked to testify. The_ DPR has also
 become increasingly a focal point of appeals and petitions from students, workers,
 displaced farmers, and others protesting alleged human rights abuses and airing
 other grievances.
 While there     no de jure restrictions on women in politics, only 55 out of 500
 members of the DPR are women; 2 women are Cabinet members.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vest igation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While variuious domet or    tons and persons intereteed in human and work-
 er rights operate energetically, some, such as the unrecognized trade union SBSI
 (see Section 6.a.) and te     ce of Independent Journalists, faced government
 harassment including police raids on their offices, surveillance by police or military
 intelligence, interrogations at police stations, or cancellations of private meetings.
 The Government considers outside investigations of alleged human rights viola-
 tions to be interference in its internal affairs and emphasizes its belief that linking
 foreign assistance to human rights observance is unacceptable.
 
 
 623
 The ICRC continued to operate in East Timor, Irian Jaya, and Aceh, and to visit
 prisoners convicted of participation in the abortive, Communist-backed coup in 1965,
 convicted Muslim extremists, and East Timorese prisoners.
 While receiving wide support for its work from the Government in Jakarta, the
 ICRC continually faced difficulty in implementing its humanitarian program in East
 Timor during 1995. The ICRC no longer maintains an office in Irian Jaya but visits
 that province from Jakarta several times a year. The ICRC also visits Aceh regu-
 larly, but the Government has not approved the ICRC's request to open an oince
 there. The Government facilitated the visit of U.N. Human Rights Commissioner
 Jose Ayala Lasso to Jakarta and East Timor in December. Travel to East Timor by
 foreign human rights NGO's has not been approved. Indonesian human rights orga-
 nizations are able to visit East Timor, but have not been authorized to open offices
 there.
 The government-appointed National Human Rights Commission in its second
 year of operation, became increasingly active in examining reported human rights
 violations and continued to show independence and a willingness to criticize govern-
 ment actions and policies. The Commission's report of its investigation of the Janu-
 ary 12 killing of six East Timorese in Liquisa charged that the military forces in-
 volved tortured and murdered the suspects, calling into question the military's origi-
 nal contention that they were killed in a firefight. The Commission also sent inves-
 tigative teams to Irian Jaya in August and September, and found evidence to sup-
 port NGO and church reports of the torture and killing of civilians by security forces
 in that province, as well as security police responsibility for disappearances of civil-
 ians. Lacking enforcement powers, the Commission attempts to work within the sys-
 tem, sending teams where necessary to inquire into possible human rights problems
 and employing persuasion, publicity, and moral authority to highlight abuses, make
 recommendations for legal and regulatory changes, and encourage corrective action.
 The Commission has yet to occupy its own permanent facilities and continues to
 have very limited staff support. Although the Government appointed the original
 Commission members, the Commission ills vacancies in its ranks independently by
 internal election.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution does not explicitly forbid discrimination based on gender, race,
 disability, language, or social status. However, the Constitution stipulates equal
 rights and obligations for all Indonesian citizens, both native and naturalized. Clap-
 ter4of the1993GuidelinesofStatePoicy(legalstatutesadopted by the Peoples
 Consultative Assembly) explicitly states that women have the same rights, obliga-
 tions, and opportunities as men.
 Article 29 of the Constitution grants Indonesians the right to practice their indi-
 vidual religion and beliefs.
 Women.-Violence against women remains poorly documented. However, the Gov-
 ernment has acknowledged the problem of domestic violence in society, which some
 say has been ag*gravated by reent social changes brought about by rapid urbaniza-
 tion. ongtandng traditional beliefs that the husband may "teach" or "control" the
 wife through several means, including violence, also contribute to the problem. Al-
 though women's goups are trying to change the law, rape by a husband of a wife
 is not a crime in Indonesia. While police could bring assault charges against a hus-
 band for beating his wife, due to social attitudes they are unlikely to do so. The Gov-
 ernment provides some counseling, and several private organizations exist to assist
 women. Many of these organizations focus mainly on reuniting the family rather
 than on providing protection to the women involved. In 1995, the first drop-in center
 for battered women was founded in Jakarta by an NGO. There are no battered
 women's shelters. Many women rely on extended family systems for assistance in
 cases of domestic violence.
 Rape is a punishable offense in Indonesia. Men have been arrested and sentenced
 for rape and attempted rape although reliable statistics are unavailable. Women's
 rights activists believe rape is grossly underreported owing to the social stigma at-
 tached to the victim. Some legal experts state that if a woman does not go imme-
 diately to the hospital for a physical examination which produces semen or other
 physical evidence of rape, she will not be able to bring charges. Some women fail
 to report rape to police out of fear of being molested again by the police themselves.
 By law, women are equal to and have the same rights, obligations, and opportuni-
 ties as men. However, in practice women face some legal discrimination. For exam-
 ple in divorce cases women often bear a heavier evidentiary burden than men, espe-
 cially in the Islamic-based family court system. Although some women enjoy a high
 degree of economic and social freedom and occupy important midlevel positions m
 
 
 both the public and private sectors, the majority of women do not experience such
 social and economic freedoms and are often disproportionately represented at the
 lower end of the scale. Although women constitute one-quarter of the civil service,
 they occupy only a small fraction of the service's top posts. Income disparity be-
 tween men and women diminishes significantly with greater educational attain-
 ment.
 Women are often not given the extra benefits and salary that men receive that
 is their due when they are the head of household, and in some cases do not receive
 employment benefits for their husband and children, such as medical insurance. De-
 spite laws guaranteeing women a 3-month maternity leave, the Government has
 conceded that pregnant women are often dismissed or are replaced while on leave.
 Some companies require that women sign statements that they will not become
 regnant. Women workers also have complained of being sexually victimized by
 oremen and factory owners.
 Women workers in manufacturing generally receive lower wages than men and
 also are more likely to be hired only on a daily basis. As a result they are less likely
 to receive benefits legally mandated for permanent workers. Uinemployment rates
 for women are approximately 50 percent higher than for men.
 Women disproportionately experience illiteracy, poor health, and inadequate nu-
 trition. However, women's educational indicators have improved in the last decade.
 For example, the number of girls graduating from high school tripled from 1980 to
 1990. Several voluntary private groups work actively to advance women's legal, eco-
 nomic, social, and political rights and claim some success in gaining official cog-
 nizance of women's concerns.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and welfare, but is
 hampered by a lack of resources to translate this commitment into practice. A 1979
 law on children's welfare defines the responsibility of the State and parents to nur-
 ture and protect children. However, implementing regulations have never been de-
 veloped, and the law's provisions have yet to go into effect. The Government has
 made particular efforts to improve primary education, maternity services, and fam-
 ily planning. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) estimates that more
 than 1 millin children drop out of primary school every year due mainly to the cost
 of supplies, uniforms and other expenses, in addition to the professed need for the
 children to supplement family income. Thousands of street children living in Ja-
 karta and other cities sell newspapers, shine shoes, help to park or watch cars, and
 otherwise earn money. Many thousands more work in factories and fields (see also
 Section 6.d.). NGO's criticize government efforts to help these children as inad-
 equate.
 Child prostitution and other sexual abuses occur, especially cases of incest be-
 tween stepfathers and stepdaughters, but data on their incidence are lacking. Some
 child care experts believe it to be low. While there are laws designed to protect chil-
 dren from indecent activities, prostitution, and incest, the Government has made no
 special enforcement efforts in these areas. A separate criminal justice stem for ju-
 veniles does not exist; however, the Department of Justice is drafting legislation to
 establish a special court system and criminal code for juveniles. In 1995 media at-
 tention focused on the case of a 9-year old who was arrested for theft and held with
 adult offenders by police. The child was also allegedly beaten by police during inter-
 rogation. Police officials admitted that juveniles are often imprisoned with adult of-
 fenders.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM) occurs in some parts of Indonesia. There are no
 statistics available; the only information available is anecdotal. In Java, it usually
 takes place within the first year after birth and is performed either at a hospital
 or by a local traditional practitioner or "dukun," especially in rural areas. Usually
 a small section of the tip of the clitoris is cut or a small incision is made in the
 tip of the clitoris with the purpose of drawing a few drops of blood. Total removal
 of the clitoris is not the objective of the practice, although it does occur if ineptly
 performed.
 Parliament members asked Department of Health officials to investigate the inci-
 dence of FGM after the U.S. human rights report came out 3 years ago. They infor-
 mally contacted the heads of gynecology and obstetrics departments at Jakarta hos-
 pitals who reported no evidence of health problems due to FGM.
 People With Disabilities.-No national law specifically addresses the problems or
 status of the disabled, nor do they receive special programs or attention. However,
 during 1994 the Ministry of Social Welfare began drafting regulations on treatment
 of the disabled partly based on the Americans with Disabilities Act. In 1994 Presi-
 dent Soeharto gave his approval to submit these new regulations to the Parliament;
 however, the draft is in the Cabinet Secretariat being readied for submission in
 early 1996. Virtually no public buildings or public means of transport are designed
 
 
 specifically for access by the disabled. They face considerable discrimination in em-
 ployment.
 The Constitution includes the right of every citizen to obtain an education. In
 1989 the Government issued regulations covering education for the mentally and
 physically disabled. However, the regulations do not grant a right to public edu-
 cation for disabled children. While there are some public schools for the disabled,
 the Government supports the concept that education should be provided by the com-
 munity in the form of NGO-run private schools that may receive some public funds.
 Indigenous People.-The Government states publicly that it recognizes the exist-
 ence of several indigenous population groups, and that they have a right to partici-
 pate fully in political and social life. Critics maintain that the Government's ap-
 proach is basically paternalistic and designed more to integrate indigenous people
 more closely into Indonesian society than to protect their traditional way of life.
 Human rights monitors criticize the Government's transmigration program for vio-
 lating the rights of indigenous people (see Section 1.f.).
 Where indigenous people clash with development projects, the developers almost
 always win. Tensions with indigenous people m Irian Jaya, including in the vicinity
 of the Freeport McMoran mining concession area near Timika, led to a crackdown
 by government security forces, resulting in the deaths of civilians and other violent
 human rights abuses. These abuses (see Section 1.b.) were documented by the Na-
 tional Human Rights Commission the Catholic Church, and NGO's. In its reports
 on these incidents, the National HIuman Rights Commission did not indicate that
 the Freeport company, which operates a large copper and gold mine in the province,
 was responsible or the human rights abuses in  e area. Freeport has denied any
 involvement in the abuses; some NGO's believe further investigation is warranted.
 Human rights monitors have expressed concern about the practices of some logging
 companies which recruit indigenous pople for wrk. According ~o Human Rights
 Watch/Asia, this activity in Irian Jaya has separated these people from their tradi-
 tional economies. Mast civil servants in local governments in Irian Jaya and other
 isolated areas continue to come primarily from Java, rather than from the local in-
 digenous population.
 National[RaciallEthnic Minorities.-Indonesians exhibit considerable racial and
 ethnic tolerance, with the important exception of official and informal discrimination
 against ethnic Chinese, who comprise about 3 percent of the population. Since 1959
 noncitizen ethnic Chinese have been denied the right to run businesses in rural In-
 donesia. Regulations prohibit the operation of all Chinese schools for ethnic Chinese,
 formation of exclusively Chinese cultural groups or trade associations, and public
 display of Chinese characters. Since August 1994, firms working in the tourist in-
 dustry are allowed to produce Chinese-language brochures, programs, and similar
 material for Chinese-speaking tourists. However, Chinese-language publications,
 with the exception of one government-owned daily newspaper, may neither be im-
 ported nor produced domestically. Private instruction in Chinese is generally prohib-
 ited but takes place to a limited extent, and since 1994 has been allowed to train
 employees in the tourism industry in functional Mandarin. State universities have
 no formal quotas that limit the number of ethnic Chinese. The law forbids the cele-
 bration of the Chinese New Year in temples or public places, but its enforcement
 was limited in 1995. Chinese New Year decorations were displayed in public shop-
 ping areas in major cities.
 East Timorese and various human rights groups charge that the East Timorese
 are underrepresented in the civil service in East Timor. It is difficult to confirm or
 deny the charges as there appears to be no registry of the birthplace of civil serv-
 ants, who can be transferred anywhere. East Timorese have expressed concerns that
 the transmigration program (see Section 1.f.) could lead to fewer employment oppor-
 tunities and might eventually destroy East Timor's cultural identity. However, these
 concerns probably were exaggerated. In the last several years, informal migration
 to the province has sparked socioeconomic tension in urban areas, proving an even
 greater concern than the formally sponsored transmigration program. In mid-1995,
 ast Timors provincial government instructed its officials to limit the stay in the
 province of non-Timorese seeking jobs to a maximum of 3 months. It is too early
 to assess how well these new measures have been implemented.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Private sector workers, including those in export
 processing zones, are by law free to form worker organizations without prior author-
 ization. However, government policies and current numerical requirements for union
 recognition constitute a significant barrier to freedom of association and the right
 to engage in collective bargaining. The Department of Man ower uses a regulation
 that requires that a union be set up "by and for workers to deny recognition to
 
 
 626
 
 groups which include people it considers nonworkers, such as lawyers or human
 rights activists who are involved as labor organizers. Until 1994 only the govern-
 ment-sponsored All-Indonesia Workers Union SPSI could bargain on behalf of em-
 ployees or represent workers in the Department of Manpower's labor courts. A 1994
 regulation provides that workers in a single company with more than 25 employees
 can join together as a "plant-level union" and negotiate a legally binding agreement
 with their employer outside the SPSI framework, although the Government encour-
 ages these plant-level unions to join the SPSI. Over 900 plant-level unions existed
 by December.
 There is a de facto single union system, the SPSI and its 13 federated sectoral
 unions. The SPSI maintains international contacts but is not affiliated with any
 international trade union organizations except the Association of Southeast Asian
 Nations (ASEAN) Trade Union Council. The SPSI completed in 1995 a trans-
 formation from a unitary (centralized) to a federative (decentralized) structure. Its
 13 industrial sectors are now registered as independent unions and are the only
 unions recognized by the Department of Manpower. The Minister of Manpower has
 stated that any unions which are formed should affiliate with the SPSI federation,
 and that the Government will not recognize any unions outside the federation. The
 Government's stated policy is to improve effectiveness of the recognized SPSI unions
 rather than to allow the formation of alternative organizations.
 Two other labor groups, Setia Kawan (Solidarity), also known as Serikat Buruh
 Merdeka (SBM, Free Trade Union), and Serikat Buruh Sejahtera Indonesia (SBSI,
 Indonesian Workers Welfare Union), have been organized but are not registered.
 Setia Kawan, founded 4 years ago, is now essentially moribund.
 The SBSI, created in 1992, claims that it has formed the necessary number of fac-
 tory-level units to meet the legal requirements for registration as a labor union, but
 its most recent request (in November 1994) for registration as a trade union was
 denied. The Department of Manpower has also blocked SBSI attempts to register
 with the Department of Home Affairs as a social organization under the ORMAS
 Law. The Government considers the SBSI to be illegal. Although the Government
 has not disbanded it, it has continually harassed the SBSI, especially after large-
 scale labor demonstrations, which SBSI helped to organize in Medan in April 1994,
 degenerated into anti-Chinese rioting. The Government arrested a number of the
 Medan SBSI leadership and its National Chairman, Muchtar Pakpahan, and tried
 and convicted them of inciting violence in connection with the riots, charges which
 the International Labor Organization (ILO) and many international observers be-
 lieved were unjustified. This view appears to be correct. All the others have now
 served their sentences and have been released. The Supreme Court overturned
 Pakpahan's sentence (see Section i.e.). It is widely believed that the Government's
 actions against the SBSI leadership were intended to discredit or destroy the organi-
 zation. Government harassment of SBSI, including disbanding its meetings and
 training seminars, continued throughout 1995.
 Because of past Department of Manpower regulations, many SPSI factory units
 are led by persons who have little credibility with their units' members because they
 were selected by employers. A new regulation states that employees must only no-
 tify their employer that they wish to form a union and that they may proceed if
 they d not receive a response from their employer within 2 weeks. Despite this new
 provision, strikes continue to occur because employers attempt to prevent the forma-
 tion of union branches. These strikes are invariably successful, and the formation
 of an SPSI unit follows shortly thereafter. However, workers who are active in the
 formation of the union are frequently dismissed and have no practical protection by
 either law or government practice.
 Civil servants are not permitted to join unions and must belong to KORPRI, a
 nonunion association whose Central Development Council is chaired by the Minister
 of Home Affairs. State enterprise employees, defined to include those working in en-
 terprises in which the state has a 5-percent holding or greater, usually are required
 to join KORPRI, but a small number of state enterprises have SPSI units. Teachers
 must belong to the Teachers' Association (PGRI). While technically classed as a
 union, the PGRI continues to function more as a welfare organization and does not
 appear to have engaged in trade union activities such as collective bargaining.
 Unions may draw up their own constitutions and rules and elect their representa-
 tives. However, the Government has a great deal of influence over the SPSI and its
 federated unions. The new head of SPSI is a member of Parliament for GOLKAR,
 and many members of the executive council are also members of GOLKAR and its
 constituent functional groups. These persons have been given positions in the new
 federated industrial sector unions. The Minister of Manpower is a member of the
 SPSrs Consultative Council. Numerous regional SPSI officials also are GOLKAR
 members, sometimes serving in regional legislatures. According to credible reports,
 
 
 627
 the Government interferes in the selection of SPSI officers, especially by placing re-
 tired military officers in mid-level SPSI positions. The Government has stated that
 it will cease the practice of placing military officers in union positions and eventu-
 ally will remove officials with significant GOLKAR connections. The Department of
 Manpower supported the SPSI in its successful resistance to an attempt by the re-
 gent of Kudus, Central Java, to name a retired military officer as SPSI district
 head.
 Under the Criminal Code, police approval is needed for all meetings of five or
 more people of all organizations outside offices or normal work sites, though the
 Government late in 1995 announced its intention to relax this regulation (see Sec-
 tion 2.b.). This provision also applies to union meetings. Permission is routinely
 given to the SPSI but not to rival organizations such as the SBSI which was pre-
 vented from holding several meetings over the last few years, including its first con-
 gress in 1993. In April police curtailed an SPSI third anniversary gathering in Ja-
 karta. The Government may dissolve a union if it believes the union is acting
 against Pancasila, although it has never actually done so, and there are no laws or
 regulations specifying procedures for union dissolution.
 In 1994 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions lodged a formal
 complaint against Indonesia with the ILO, accusing the Government of denying
 workers' right to set up unions of their own choosing, harassing independent work-
 ers' organizations, and of taking other actions contrary to ILO standards on freedom
 of association and the right to collective bargaining. In considering this complaint,
 the ILO's Committee on Freedom of Association declared in April that "legal impedi-
 ments negate the right of workers to establish organizations of their own choosing"
 and deeply deplored "the seriousness of the allegations, which led it to believe that
 the general situation of workers in Indonesia has not evolved but is still character-
 ized1by serious and worsening infringements of basic human and trade union rights
 and violations of freedom of association principles in law and practice."
 While Pancasila principles call for labr-management differences to be settled by
 consensus, all organized workers except civil servants have the legal right to strike.
 While state enterprise employees and teachers rarely exercise this right, private sec-
 tor strikes are frequent. Before a strike can occur in the private sector, the law re-
 quires intensive mediation by the Department of Manpower and prior notice of the
 intent to strike. However, no approval is required. In practice, dispute settlement
 procedures are not followed, and formal notice of the intent to strike is rarely given
 because Department of Manpower procedures are slow. These procedures have ittle"
 credibility with workers, who ignore them. Therefore, sudden strikes tend to result
 from longstanding grievances or recognition that legally mandated benefits or rights
 are not being received. While strike eaders are not arrested for illegal strikes, they
 often lose their jobs and have no legal recourse for reinstatement. The number of
 strikes has decreased significantly since the latter half of 1994, reversing a trend
 of the previous few years. Government actions to raise and more vigorously enforce
 minimum wage rates may be partly responsible.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 vided for by law, and the Department of Manpower promotes it within the context
 of the national ideology, Pancasila. Until 1994 only recognized trade unions-the
 SPSI and its components-could legally engage in collective bargaining. Since early
 1994, new government regulations also permit unaffiliated plant-level workers' asso-
 ciations to conclude legally binding agreements with employers, and some 24 had
 done so by mid-1995, according to government figures. Agreements concluded by any
 other groups are not considered legally binding and are not registered by the De-
 partment of Manpower. The majority of the collective bargaimang agreements be-
 tween the SPSI units and employers are negotiated bilaterally. Once notified that
 25 employees have joined a registered SPSI or independent plant level union, an
 employer is obligated to bargain with it. In companies without unions, the Govern-
 ment discourages workers from utilizing outside assistance, e.g., during consulta-
 tions with employers over company regulations. Instead, the Department of Man-
 power prefers that workers seek its assistance and believes that its role is to protect
 workers. There are credible reports that for some companies, consultations are per-
 functory at best and usually with management-selected workers; there are also cred-
 ible reports to the contrary from foreign companies. Over half of the factory-level
 SPSI units have collective bargaining agreements. The degree to which these agree-
 ments are freely negotiated between unions and management without government
 interference varies. By regulation, negotiations must be concluded within 30 days
 or be submitted to the Department of Manpower for mediation and conciliation or
 arbitration. Most negotiations are concluded within the 30-day period. Agreements
 are for 2 years and can be extended for 1 year. According to NGO's involved in labor
 issues, the provisions of these agreements rarely go beyond the legal minimum
 
 
 628
 standards established by the Government, and the agreements are often merely pre-
 sented to worker representatives for signing rather than being negotiated.
 Although government regulations prohibit employers from discriminating or
 harassing employees because of union membership, there are credible reports from
 union officials of employer retribution against union organizers, including firing,
 which is not effectively prevented or remedied in practice. Some employers report-
 edly have warned their employees against contact with union organizers from the
 unrecognized SBSI organization. Charges of antiunion discrimination are adu-
 dicate[ by administrative tribunals. However, because many union members believe
 the tribunals generally side with employers, many workers reject or avoid the proce-
 dure andpresent their grievances directly to Pariament and other agencies. Admin-
 istrative decisions in favor of dismissed workers tend to be monetary awards; work-
 ers are rarely reinstated. The provisions of the law make it difficult to fire workers,
 but the law is often ignored in practice.
 Commenting on antiunion discrimination and restrictions on collective bargaining
 in the context of ILO Convention 98 on the right to organize and bargain collec-
 tively, the ILO's Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommenda-
 tions' June report expressed deep concern that "in spite of the direct contacts mis-
 sion that went to Indonesia in November 1993, the discussion within the present
 committee last year, and the technical advisory mission that went to Indonesia in
 January 1995, much progress was yet to be achieved to ensure in law and in prac-
 tice the full application of the convention."
 The armed forces, which include the police, continues to involve itself in labor is-
 sues, despite new regulations promulgated in 1994 to prohibit military interference
 when there is no threat to security. There is some evidence that the incidence of
 such military involvement has decreased since 1994, but not all observers share this
 perception. Workers charge that members of the security forces attempt to intimi-
 date union organizers and strike leaders and have been present in significant num-
 bers during some strikes, even when there has been no destruction of property or
 other violence. Members of military intelligence attended and monitored trade union
 education seminars run by the Asian-American Free Labor Institute (AAFLI) and
 an AAFLI-SPSI sponsored seminar on democratization, even though these programs
 were approved by the Department of Manpower. An AAFLI-SPSI program on legal
 aid for idustria disputes approved by the Department of Manpower, which the
 military command in Surabaya halted in 1993, was never allowed to resume despite
 government assurances to the contrary. Military officials occasionally have been re-
 ported present during negotiations between workers and management. Their pres-
 ence has been described as intimidating by plant-level union officials. A military of-
 ricer was among those convicted in connection with the Marsinah murder case.
 Labor Law applies equally in export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law forbids forced labor, and
 the Government generally enforces it. However, there are credible reports of teenage
 children being forced to. work under highly dangerous conditions on fishing plat-
 forms off the coast of northeastern Sumatra. These platforms are miles off shore,
 with access controlled by the employers, and in many cases the children are held
 virtual prisoners on the platforms and forced to work for up to 3 months at a time
 for well below the minimum wage. According to knowledgeable sources, hundreds
 of children may be involved. The local government has done little to address the
 problem.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Child labor exists in both indus-
 trial and rural areas, and in both the formal and informal sectors. There are an esti-
 mated 2.7 million working children between the ages of 10 and 14, according to a
 1994 report of the UNited Nations Human Rights Commission. The number of out-
 of-school children age 7 to 15 who are economically active may be as high as 6.5
 million, according to a 1989 study, and the number would be even greater if those
 who have not left school are included. Indonesia was one of the first countries to
 be selected for participation in the ILO's international Program on the Elimination
 of Child Labor (IPEC), and it signed a memorandum of understanding with the ILO
 on May 29, 1992 to guide collaboration under this program. Recommendations for
 an action plan were developed at a national conference in Bogor in July 1993. Dur-
 ing 1995, 30 government labor inspectors received ILO-sponsored training on child
 labor matters under the IPEC program. However, enforcement remains lax.
 The Government acknowledges that there is a class of children who must work
 for socioeconomic reasons, and in 1987 the Minister of Manpower issued regulation
 per-oYmen/1987, "Protection of Children Forced to Work," to regulate this situation.
 This regulation legalizes the employment of children under the age of 14 who must
 work to contribute to the income of their families. It requires parental consent, pro-
 hibits dangerous or difficult work, limits work to 4 hours daily, and requires em-
 
 
 ployers to report the number of children working under its provisions. It does not
 set a minimum age for children in this category, effectively superseding the colonial-
 era government ordinance of December 17, 1925 on "Measures Limiting Child
 Labor and Nightwork of Women," which is still tle current law governing child
 labor and sets a minimum age of 12 for employment. The 1987 regulation is not
 enforced. No employers have been taken to court for violating its restrictions on the
 nature of employment for children, and no reports are collected from establishments
 employing children.
 Act'No. 1 of 1951 was intended to bring into force certain labor measures, includ-
 ing provisions on child labor which would replace those of the 1925 legislation. How-
 ever, implementing regulations for the child labor provisions have never been is-
 sued. Thus the child labor provisions in the 1951 Act have no validity.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In the absence of a national minimum wage,
 area wage councils working under the supervision of the national wage council es-
 tablish minimum wages for regions and basic needs figures for each province-a
 monetary amount considered sufficient to enable a singVe worker to meet the basic
 needs of nutrition, clothing, and shelter. While Indonesia has succeeded in dramati-
 callyr lowering the level of poverty throughout the ountry, the minimum wage rates
 until recently have usually lagged  *nd infation and even the basic needs figures.
 The Government raised minimum wage rates in 1994 and again on April 1. There
 is no national minimum wage._The minimum wage varies from province to province.
 In Jakarta it is about $2 (RP 4600) per day. While in certain provinces the new
 rates are still below the provincial basic needs figures, the Department of Manpower
 estimates that, on the average, minimum wage rates equal 108 percent of the basic
 needs figures, up from 97 percent as of August 1, 1994.The Government announced
 in November that further increases would take effect April 1, 1996. There are no
 reliable statistics on the number of employers paying at least the minimum wage.
 Independent observers' estimates range between 30 and 60 percent. The Depart-
 ment of Manpower increased the number of labor inspectors and announced a
 scheme of  blacklisting" offending ompanies, but enforcement of minimum wage
 and other labor regulations remains inadequate, and sanctions too light. The De-
 partment of Manpower has drafted a revision of a basic labor law that would raise
 statutory fines, which have been devalued by inflation, to more appropriate levels.
 Some observers believe increased government pressures on employers and memories
 of the 1994 Medan riots have improved minimum wage compliance somewhat.
 Labor law and ministerial regulations provide workers with a variety of other
 benefits, such as social security, and workers in more modern facilities often receive
 health benefits and free meals. The law establishes 7-hour workdays and 40-hour
 workweeks, with one 30-minute rest period for each 4 hours of work. The law also
 requires 1 day of rest weekly. The daily overtime rate is 1  times the normal hour-
 ly rate for the first hour, and twice the hourly rate for additional overtime. Regula-
 tions allow employers to deviate from the normal work hours upon request to the
 Minister of Manpower and with the agreement of the employee. Observance of laws
 regulating benefits and labor standards varies from sector to sector and by region.
 Employer violations of legal requirements are fairly common and often result in
 strikes and employee protests. The Ministry of Manpower continues publicly to urge
 employers to comply with the law. However, in general, government enforcement
 and supervision of labor standards are weak.
 Both law and regulations provide for minimum standards of industrial health and
 safety. In the largely Western-operated oil sector, safety and health program func-
 tion reasonably well. However, in the country's 100,000 larger registered companies
 in the nonoil sector, the quality of occupational health and safety program varies
 greatly. The enforcement of health and safety standards is severely hampered by
 the limited number of qualified Department of Manpower inspectors as well as by
 the low level of employee appreciation for sound health and safety practices. Allega-
 tions of corruption on the part of inspectors are common. Workers are obligated to
 report hazardous working conditions. Employers are forbidden by law from retaliat-
 ing against those who do, but the law is not effectively enforced.
