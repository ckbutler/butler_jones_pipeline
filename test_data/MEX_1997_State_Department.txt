 MEXICO
 Mexico is a federal republic with an elected President, a bicameral legislature,
 and a constitutionally mandated independent judiciary. On July 6, elections were
 held for the entire lower house of Congress, one-quarter of the Senate, 6 state gov-
 ernors, and over 1,000 state and local office holders in 7 states. For the first time,
 the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) lost its absolute majority in the lower
 house of Congress, and the opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) and
 National Action Party (PAN) made strong gains. This was a marked departure from
 past elections, as the PRI has won every presidential election since the party's
 founding in 1929, many of which involved credible allegations of fraudulent prac-
 tices. For the first time since the 1920's, the people of Mexico City elected a mayor,
 PRD candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. Although there were post-electoral disputes
 in a few states, including Colima and Campeche, and small-scale violence in
 Chiapas, a wide range of Mexican and international observers characterized the
 elections as largely free and fair and as a significant advance in the democratization
 process. The judiciary is nominally independent; however, on occasion it has been
 influenced by the executive branch. Corruption and inefficiency are problems and
 are more widespread in some states than others.
 Several southern states, most notably Guerrero, Oaxaca, and Chiapas, continued
 to suffer politically motivated violence. Peace talks between the Government and the
 Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) stalled in September 1996 following
 disagreement regarding the implementation of agreements signed in February 1996
 on indigenous rights. However, intense informal contacts continued through Janu-
 ary 1997. The army and the EZLN have not clashed since the Government unilater-
 ally declared a cease-fire on January 12, 1994. As part of continuing unrest in
 Chiapas, on December 22 an armed group allegedly organized by the PRI mayor
 massacred 45 indigenous persons in the village of Acteal, which increased already
 high tensions in the state. President Zedillo immediately ordered his Attorney Gen-
 eral to conduct a thorough investigation. This investigation resulted in the arrest
 of persons allegedly connected to the massacre and continued at year's end. A new
 group of uncertain origin and size, the Popular Revolutionary Army (EPR), made
 its appearance in June 1996. The Government considers the EPR a terrorist organi-
 zation and has vowed to bring the group to  stice.
 Police forces maintain internal security. The army is responsible for external secu-
 rity but also has domestic security responsibilities. The military withdrew from Fed-
 eral District police responsibilities effective December 22. The security forces, in-
 cluding the federal and state judicial police, federal highway police, and local police,
 are under the control of elected civilian officials. However, corruption is rife within
 police ranks. Members of the security forces continued to commit numerous human
 rights abuses.
 Mexico has a market-based, mixed economy, which the Government has been pro-
 gressively deregulating and opening. An ambitious program of privatization has re-
 duced state-owned companies from more than 1,150 to less than 200. During the
 third quarter, about 29 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) came from the in-
 dustrial sector, 5 percent from agicul ture, and 66 percent from the service sector.
 There is significant subsistence agriculture, and 25 percent of the populace lives in
 rural areas. Leading exports include automobiles, manufactured and assembled
 products (including electronics and consumer goods), and petroleum. Per capita GDP
 was about $4,100, but consmption and wages remained 1elow 1994 levels, produc-
 ing high levels of crime and social tension. There are severe and growing inequal-
 ities in income distribution, with large numbers of people living in extreme poverty
 in rural areas, shanty towns, and uban slums. In February the Government initi-
 ated an antipoverty program    (renamed Progresa in August) intended to help
 500,000 of the poorest amilies by year's end.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, although se-
 rious problems remained in some areas, and some states present special concerns.
 Major abuses included extrajudicial killings, disappearances, torture, illegal arrests,
 arbitrary detentions, poor prison conditions, lengthy pretrial detention, lack of due
 process, corruption and inefficiency in the judiciary, illegal searches, violence
 against women, discrimination against women and indigenous persons, some limits
 on worker rights, and extensive child labor in agriculture and in the informal econ-
 
 
 571
 omy. Vigilante killings, attacks against journalists, and attacks and threats to
 human rights monitors were also problems.
 The Government continued, with limited success its attempt to end the "culture
 of impunity" surrounding the security forces through reforms in the federal Attorney
 General's Office (PGR). The PGR continued to restructure to combat internal corrup-
 tion. Major steps included the reorganization of its subordinate bodies, the dismissal
 of hundreds of employees, training programs targeting both new and long time
 agents, and the creation of new units, all of whose members must undergo an in-
 depth vetting process including polygraphs, financial and background investigations,
 and drug testing. The Government also continued its support for the government-
 funded ationalHuman Rights Commission (CNDH) and for implementation of a
 wide-ranging package of other police and judicial reforms.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Members of the security forces com-
 mitted extrajudicial killings. According to Amnesty International (Pd), three persons
 died in June due to torture by police (see Section 1.c.).
 On October 2, the Mexico City Attorney General's office charged a police officer
 with four murders related to a September 8 shooting during a police sweep of the
 neighborhoods of Buenos Aires and Doctores. Subsequent investigations resulted in
 the arrest of additional officers. In November rebellious security force members bar-
 ricaded themselves in their barracks to block the arrest of individuals in connection
 with the abduction, torture, and killing of six youths in those sweeps. They surren-
 dered to fellow soldiers after a 14-hour standoff. At year's end, 32 police officers
 were in jail, including three high-ranking military officers of the unit on suspicion
 that they had tried to cover up the killings. The CNDH and the Attorney General's
 office were also conducting investigations.
 In November police officers in Acapulco, angered by a traffic dispute with a taxi
 driver tied him up in his taxi, poured gasoline over him, and burned him to death.
 On becember 25, a spokesman for the fifth military zone located in Guadalajara
 announced that 28 officers and enlisted men had been implicated in kidnaping, tor-
 ture, and killing that occurred in the municipality of Zapopan on December 14-15.
 In that incident, 20 youths were allegedly held against their will and tortured. Mili-
 tary personnel from an air base in Ocotan, near Zapopan, apparently kidnaped 23-
 year-old Salvador Jimenez Aguilar, tortured him, and then killed him. After interro-
 gating soldiers serving at the air base, military, officials found his body on December
 20. The military justice system assumed jurisdiction of the investigation and pros-
 ecution from the federal authorities (see Section i.e.).
 Police and vigilantes acting on behalf of local landowners continued to commit
 extrajudicial killings while dislodging peasant squatters from rural lands in several
 states. To expand communal land hodngs, for decades peasants have invaded pri-
 vate lands and petitioned for government recognition of the seizures.
 Some large landowners and local political bosses in Chiapas state maintain pri-
 vate militias to defend their property from peasant land invasions and to intimidate
 local opposition. This problem is especially acute in some northern regions of the
 state, where the group Development, Peace, and Justice ("Desarrollo, Paz y
 Justicia"), headed by autonomous local political bosses loosely affiliated with the
 PRI, is based. A number of local armed groups, including Peace and Justice and the
 "Chinchulines," reportedly banded together to form an anti-Zapatista indigenous
 front. State authorities do not effectively impede the establishment of these militias,
 which reportedly often employ police and military personnel. In December there
 were press reports that the Chiapas state government provided financial assistance
 to the Peace and Justice group in Auaust, under the auspices of agrarian reform.
 On March 14, in the community of San Pedro Nixtalucum, El Bosque municipal-
 ity, Chiapas, police killed 4 peasants and detained 24 others during a confrontation
 between the peasants and members of the PRI. The elected mayor of El Bosque is
 a member of the PRI. Prior to the events of March 14, PRD supporters had con-
 tested the electoral results, set up a "popular government," and held 12 PRI party
 members, including the municipal agent, oatage in the town hall. The PRD action
 was reportedly in response to the arrest of PRD members by the PRI municipal gov-
 ernment. A group of about 26 state police officers arrived in San Pedro to release
 the hostages. Armed villagers surrounded the police. An attempt to negotiate broke
 down when shots were fired, four peasants were killed, and six police were wound-
 ed. The police withdrew and returned later with army support and arrested 24 peas-
 ants. During the clash, the poice called in a state police helicopiter for support. This
 heiopter, used for reonnais"sane and for evacuating wounded, was not armed. Ac-
 
 
 cording to various reports, one or two police officers inside the helicopter fired at
 the crowd, both to back up the police on the ground and possibly to clear a landing
 zone. According to the Fray Bartolome de Las Casas Human Rights Center, the au-
 thorities charged the 24 arrested peasants with kidnaping, criminal association, and
 assault; they also charged 13 of the 24 with homicide. In addition, members of Peace
 and Justice expelled the people of San Pedro from the town. Following negotiations
 that were assisted by the state government, a "nonaggression" agreement was
 signed on May 8 permitting the peasants to return home. In late May, the authori-
 ties released all 24 detained peasants, 3 of whom claimed to have been tortured by
 police. On May 31, the four widows received compensation from the state govern-
 ment. The CNDH has conducted an investigation, and a report was pending at
 year's end.
 The town of Chenalho, Chiapas state, suffered an increasingly tense political situ-
 ation during the year. Since May, increased tension between PRI su pporters and
 EZLN sympathizers led to the displacement of 6,000 indigenous e  e, the injury
 of at least 35 persons, and the deaths of 16 people. PRD and EZLN sympathizers
 tried to set up a "popular government" in the town, the mayor was alleged to have
 made threats against the parish priest, and a PRI member was ambushed and kid-
 naped on December 17. On December 22, an armed group allegedly or anized by
 the PRI mayor massacred 45 indigenous persons in the nearby village oActeal. At
 President Zedillo's direction, federal authorities opened an investigation headed by
 Attorney General Madrazo and arrested 46 persons in connection with the mas-
 sacre, including the mayor of Chenalho and the state police chief. The CNDH also
 opened an- investigation, and the CNDH president criticized the state government's
 "negligence" in not responding more quickly to reports that the massacre was under-
 way. In response to a CNDH recommendation, the federal Attorney General's office
 broadened its investigation to include senior officials in the Chiapas state govern-
 ment. This investigation continued at year's end. The state governor and his cabinet
 resigned. The Interior Secretary and the Government's chief negotiator for Chiapas
 both resigned following the Acteal massacre.
 According to statistics compiled by the District Attorney's office for Chiapas state
 in 1996, approximately 500 peasants had been killed in the previous 3 years as a
 result of violence in the northern municipalities of Tila, Sabanilla, Salto de Agua,
 and Tumbala. The Fray Bartolome de las Casas Center for Human Rights reported
 that at least 2,000 indigenous families had abandoned their lands for fear of violent
 attacks by the Peace and Justice group.
 Police continued to evict, detain arbitrarily, and destroy the homes of peasant
 leaders in the state of Veracruz. Land disputes in the state, especially those involv-
 ing ranchers and indigenous persons, are the principal cause of such violence. Police
 often fail to investigate killings of peasants by ranchers.
 On April 10, 1996, citizens of Tepoztlan, Morelos, were marching on the "Emiliano
 Zapata route" to Tlaltizapan in order to present a petition to President Zedillo pro-
 testing the planned development of a golf course on communal lands. The police
 stopped the protesters and fired shots; the protesters responded by fleeing and de-
 fending themselves with rocks. In the melee, police shot and killed one protester,
 Marcos Olmedo. The governor of Morelos denounced the shooting, saying that police
 were under standing instructions not to use firearms against demonstrators. Accord-
 ing to the Migel Augustin pro Juarez Center for Human Rights, the police group
 responsible for the shooting has been disbanded. The authorities suspended 60 po-
 lice for abuse of authority and arrested 11 police and 2 high ranking officers for pre-
 sumed responsibility for the killing of Olmedo.
 On July 13, the courts found 28 police officers and 11 state government officials,
 including the former director of operations of the state police, guilty of homicide and
 abuse of authority in the June 28, 1995, slaying of 17 peasants in Aguas Blancas,
 Guerrer. The former state interior department director Esteban Mendoza Ramos
 received 261/2 years in jail. The courts tried, found guilty, and sentenced other offi-
 cials from the state interior department and the state attorney general's office to
 3 years and 3 months   jail for attempting to alter video evidence in order to show
 falsely that the police had reacted in self-defense against armed peasants. The
 courts also sentenced Rosendo Armijo de los Santos, the former undersecretary for
 the state security and highway office, to 5 years for not properly carrying out his
 public duties, and Orlando Soberanis Moreno, former state prosecutor, to 8 months
 for falsifying documents. Four other officials were not sentenced due to constitu-
 tional writs of protection ("amparos").
 There were no new developments in the cases of Raul Salinas de Gortari, brother
 of the former president, and Mario Ruiz Massieu, former deputy attorney general
 who face charges stemming from the assassination of then-PRI secretary general
 Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu in September 1994.
 
 
 There were no new developments in cases pending from 1992-95, involving Gas-
 ton Ayala Beltran, a former state judicial police officer; Othon Cortez Vazquez, the
 alleged second gunman in the March 1994 assassination of PRI presidential can-
 idate Luis Donaldo Colosio; and police officer Jose Antonio Verduzco Flores, freed
 in the beating death of U.S. citizen Mario Amado.
 According to the January-June PRD human rights report, 79 PRD activists were
 killed during 1996, bringing the total number of P RD members killed since 1994 to
 253. The PRD reported 180 cases of human rights violations against its partisans.
 Arbitrary detentions were the most reported crime with 90 complaints, followed by
 homicide, 32 cases; torture, 31 cases; and missing persons, 22 cases. The PRD is
 working with the Secretariat of the Interior and with the CNDH on this issue.
 b. Disappearance.-There were credible reports by the media and NGO's of dis-
 appearances during sweeps by security and military forces in Qaxaca and Guerrero
 in attempts to round up EPR members. The EPR claimed that seven of its members
 have disappeared: Gilberto Romero Vasquez, Gregorio Alfonso Alvarado Lopez,
 Miguel Castro Monllo, Fredy Nava Rios, Benito Bahena Maldonado, and EPR mem-
 bers known as "Gustavo" and "Elsa." The Miguel Agustin pro Juarez Center for
 Human Rights also cited seven disappearances related to anti-EPR sweeps. While
 denying that any individuals had been illegally detained, the Government has of-
 fered to investigate reports of disappearances.
 Since 1990, the CNDH has had a program to investigate disappearances. For the
 May 1996 to May 1997 period, the CNDII reported that it was able to resolve 26
 cases of reported disappearances. Of those cases, it found that 22 of the people were
 alive or there was evidence that they were alive, and the remaining 4 were found
 dead or presumed to be dead. This brought the total cases of presumed disappear-
 ances investigated by the CNDH to 175, of which 115 prsons were found to be liv-
 ing and 40 were found dead or there was evidence that they died.
 The police reportedly kidnaped a journalist in September (see Section 2.a.). Mili-
 tary personnel kidnaped, tortured, and killed a civilian near Ocotan, Guadalajara,
 in December (see Section L.a.).
 According to the Miguel Agustin pro Juarez Center for Human Rights, 20 people
 have disappeared in the northern states of Sinaloa, Baja California, and Chihuahua
 due to actions by narcotics traffickers. Press reports indicated that as many as 100
 people disappeared during the year in the state of Chihuahua. These disappearances
 were also attributed to narcotics traffickers and to corrupt police officers in their
 pay. The PGR appointed a special investigator to look into these disappearances.
 Amnesty International reported that twopeople who disappeared in 1995 still re-
 main missing. On May 24, 1995, the leader of the Peasant Organization of the
 Southern Sierra (OCSS), Gilberto Romero Vasquez, disappeared aWter his organiza-
 tion had presented a series of demands to state authorities. Al also reported that
 in October 1995, Cuauhtemoc Ornelas Campos, a journalist and human rights activ-
 ist, disappeared after receiving anonymous threats for publicly criticizing human
 rights abuses by local officials.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture; however, it continues to be a serious human
 rights problem. Although the Constitution excludes as evidence confessions obtained
 in the absence of the accused's defense attorney, courts have nevertheless continued
 to admit as evidence confessions extracted under torture. Members of the security
 forces continued to torture and abuse detainees. The most commonly used methods
 of torture were threats, beatings, asphyxiation, and electric shocks. Members of the
 security forces also reportedly used torture against members of the EPR and ELZN
 (see Section 1.g.).
 There are persistent reports by NGO's of widespread use of torture by police and
 security forces. The CNDH reported in May that torture dropped from the 17th to
 24th most common type of complaint, and the actual number of complaints of tor-
 ture decreased by 22 percent, with a total of 46 complaints during the year. Of the
 46 complaints, the CNDH referred 21 to state human rights authorities. Of the 25
 cases handled by the CNDH, 1 occurred in 1997, 9 in 1996, 11 in 1995, and the
 rest in prior years. The CNDH has made seven recommendations, which were being
 implemented.
 The CNDH, however, does not maintain statistics on torture complaints made to
 state human rights commissions. Of the 31 states and the Federal District, only Hi-
 dalgo lacks a law prohibiting torture. Poorly trained and equipped to investigate
 crimes, police officers continued to attempt to solve crimes by rounding up likely
 suspects and then exacting confessions from them. Many state human rights com-
 missions received reports of torture allegedly committed by police.
 The authorities punish few officials or torture, which continues to occur mainly
 because confessions are the primary evidence in many criminal convictions. Many
 
 
 574
 victims do not report, or do not follow through on, their complaints against the po-
 lice for fear of reprisals.
 According to Al, at least three people died as a result of torture. In June 25 mem-
 bers of the Amuzgo Indian community of Coachapa, Guerrero state suspected of
 theft, were subjected to beatings, prolonged hanging by the wrists, and semi-asphyx-
 iation by state police to extract a confession. Among them was 16-year-old Aifredo
 Ramirez Santiago, who was hanged by the neck from a tree and beaten on the head
 and body. Al also reported that peasant activists in Guerrero and Oaxaca states
 were tortured to oness tohaing inks with the EPR. Members of the army and
 state police allegedly subjected eight people arrested in July in Guerrero and
 Oaxaca state to beatings, prolongedhanging by the wrists, electric shocks and semi-
 asphyxiation for up to 7 dlays. The authorities charged them with having links with
 the EPR on the basis of statements extracted under torture and held them in prison
 awaiting trial at year's end. Alleged EPR members who were released on December
 5 claimed that they had been psychologically abused while being held.
 In September police apparently abducted, tortured, and killed six youths in Mex-
 ico City; in December military personnel were arrested for torturing and killing a
 citizen near Guadalajara (see Section l.a.).
 At the invitation of the Government, Nigel Rodley, the U.N. Special Rapporteur
 on Torture, visited Mexico August 5-8 to investigate allegations of torture, including
 complaints of mistreatment of alleged members of the EPR and EZLN. Rodley met
 witli many government officials. iHe also met with members of prominent Mexican
 human rights NGO's, including the Human Rights Network (which has 46 member
 NGO's), the Mexican Committee for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights,
 the Francisco de Vitoria Human Rights Center, and the Miguel Augustin pro Juarz
 Center for Human Rights.
 In testimony before Congress on September 10, Attorney General Jorge Madrazo,
 former head of the CNDH, stated that torture and intimidation are a habit with the
 police. Madrazo also highlighted steps being taken to address the problem of corrup-
 tion. He said that, because of widespread corruption and penetration by narcotics
 traffickers, he disbanded the former Institute or Nationa Drug Combat and re-
 placed it with a special prosecutor's office for crimes against health. As part of this
 clean up, the authorities dismissed 270 police officers and held 192 of them for trial.
 In the first 9 months of the year, the Attorney General's office organized 19 training
 course, including 1 for prosecutors. Madrazo also called for new laws to strengthen
 the legal mechanisms for fighting crime, improve training programs, and reform the
 penal system.
 In February then-Mexico City police chief General Enrique Salgado announced a
 plan to professionalize the police force through a training and reassignment pro-
 gram. Following the September incident in the Buenos Aires neighborhood (see Sec-
 tion l.a.) and the related arrest of 32 police and military officers, this program came
 under increasing public criticism. With the December 5 inauguration of Mexico City
 mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, and his statement that active duty military personnel
 would no Ionger serve in Federal District police roles, the military announced plans
 to end this deployment, effectively bringing an end to the training program. The
 mayor named retired army Colonel Roberto Debernardi Debernardi as police chief.
 Early in the Cardenas administration, two lower ranking police officials accused of
 past human rights violations resigned.
 Robberies committed by policemen are common. In a number of cases in northern
 border states, judges, police, and persons posing as attorneys extorted large sums
 of money ($3,000 to $10,000) from tourists to "fix" real or fabricated infractions.
 State human rights commission authorities in Coahuila widely published a toll-free
 telephone number for reporting police abuses, but, according to the Coahuila human
 rights commission, there were few if any such calls.
 Most citizens view the police as corrupt and unhelpful: 64 percent of crime victims
 in Mexico City did not report incidents to law enforcement authorities. According
 to a reliable 1995 poll, 75_percent of those surveyed felt that the justice system was
 riddled with corruption. Police academies in some states, such as Coahuila, Du-
 rango, and Sonora, sought to improve police conduct by offering special courses
 aimed at greater professionalization. However, such progress among the various po-
 lice forces is highly uneven.
 Attorney General Madrazo continued to promote a wide-ranging package of re-
 forms to reduce corruption and promote professionalism among federal police and
 prosecutors. The reform package includes new training and recruitment procedures
 for the PGR, closer supervision of PGR officers, and a reorganization of the PGR's
 structure. It also calls for creation of new units, all of whose members must undergo
 a comprehensive vetting process, including polygraph and drug testing, as well as
 fmancial and background checks. The difficult nature of this process is illustrated
 
 
 575
 by the fact that several hundred of the 1,200 PGR officials dismissed by former At-
 torney General Antonio Lozano have, on the basis of judicial appeals, won reinstate-
 ment in the PGR.
 In some cases police officers dismissed in one state find law enforcement employ-
 ment in another. The CNDH discovered that even when the authorities censured
 some officers in one law enforcement job, they moved on to other positions and were
 subsequently charged agaln with human rights abuses. In an effort to remedy this
 situation, the CNDH publishes lists of censured public servants in its annual report
 and monthly newsletters. In addition, the Government has established a national
 security register to keep track of censured police officers and address this problem.
 Prison conditions are poor. Many prisons are staffed by undertrained and corrupt
 guards and some lack adequate facilities for prisoners and are overcrowded, despite
 an early release program endorsed by the CNDH and legal reforms reducing the
 number of crimes that carry mandatory prison sentences. Prisoners complain that
 they must purchase food, medicine, and other necessities from guards or bribe
 guards to allow the goods to be brought in from outside. Drug and alcohol use is
 rampant in prisons. Frequently, prisoners exercise authority within a prison, dis-
 p lacing prison officials. Influence peddling, drug and arms trafficking, coercion, vio-
 lence, sexual abuse, and protection payoffs are the chief methods of control used by
 rs against fellow prisoners in a form of self-government within the system.
 C   fc   between rival prison groups, often involved in drug trafficking, continued
 to spark lethal violence. According to a study conducted by the CNDH, from March
 1994 to March 1996, over 50 prison riots occurred.
 While the authorities prosecuted a few-prison officials for abusing prisoners, it
 was more common to dismiss them or to charge them with only minor offenses. The
 director of the Mexico City prison system resigned in April, a day after the city's
 Human Rights Commission denounced prison abuses; one of the prison directors
 also resigned.
 The penal system comprises 4 federal penitentiaries, 8 prisons within the Federal
 District, 275 state prisons, and 151 municipal jails, for a total of 438 facilities. Ac-
 cording to the Secretary of Government's program for prevention and social re-
 adaptation, 1995-2000, the prison population has increased annually by 25 percent,
 resulting in the space designed to hold 99,650 prisoners becoming overcrowded. In
 July statistics revealed that the prison population of the Federal District far ex-
 ceeded its capacity. In space for 8,339 inmates, there were 12,598 prisoners, up from
 11,086 in November 1996, an increase of 25 percent. A CNDH study also found over-
 crowding in prisons in the states of Baja California, Sonora, Tamaulipas and
 Michoacan. The national penal system held 109,956 inmates, 10 percent above ca-
 pacity. One new prison, in the state of Mexico, opened in January; four more are
 under construction.
 Although the Constitution calls for the separation of juveniles from older pris-
 oners, men from women, and convicted criminals from prisoners held in custody, in
 practice this article is routinely violated in each aspect. Overcrowding and corrup-
 tion within the prison system results in mixing of these groups. There were reports
 of prison guards raping female prisoners and an informa prostttion ring operated
 by bth prison guards and prisoners between the all-female penitentiary of Tepepan
 and the all-male facility in Reclusorio Sur in Mexico City. Prison officials sometimes
 encourage women to form sexual liaisons with male prisoners and guards. In some
 cases, offcials coerce women into sexual relationships.
 There is one "mixed" prison in Cuernavaca, which offers rehabilitative activities
 such as vocational and recreational workshops. This prison also permits prisoner-
 run restaurants, other facilities, and includes a church inside the prison. The prison
 authorities allow visits from outside the prison, including overnight stays by chil-
 dren of detainees.
 The CNDH has a program to inspect prisons (from May 1996 to May 1997, the
 CNDH made 170 vists to 53 prisons in 27 states) and to investigate prisoner com-
 plaints.
 There is no specific law or regulation regarding the ability of NGO's to visit pris-
 ons. In practice, such prison visits are allowed and are .common. For example, mem-
 bers of the Democratic Lawyers National Front represented prisoners alleged to be
 members of the EZLN and were allowed to visit them in prison. In July the Govern-
 ment agreed to allow the International Committee of the Red Crss (ICRC) to con-
 duct visits to a number of persons held in places of detention (including high-secu-
 rity jails). Between August and September, the ICRC visited 108 people detained
 in 22 prisons. These persons are detained on the basis of their alleged links with
 illegal armed groups such as the EPR.
 d Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-aThe Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention; however, the police continued to arrest and detain citizens arbi-
 
 
 576
 trarily. The law provides that the District Attorney may not detain an accused per-
 son more than 48 hours before presenting the person before a judge, but it makes
 an exception for persons apprehended in the act of committing a crime. In Novem-
 ber 1996, Congress amendedthe Penal Procedures Federal Code to apply this excep-
 tion to acts committed up to 72 hours prior to detention. The Mexican Commission
 for Defense and Promotion of Human Rights strongly criticized this change.
 The Constitution provides that the authorities must try an accused person within
 4 months if the alleged crime carries a sentence of less than 2 years, or within 1
 year if the crime carries a longer sentence. The law requires that prisoners awaiting
 trial be housed separately from those convicted. In practice, judicial and police au-
 thorities frequently ignored these time limits. According to the CNDH and NGO's,
 the authorities often held criminal defendants with convicted prisoners and for
 longer than allowed by law before going to trial
 Arbitrary arrest and detention, often linked to corrupt police, continued to be
 among the most common human rights abuses. The Mexican Commission for De-
 fense and Promotion of Human Rights calculated 23 illegal or arbitrary detentions
 between January and September.   sin     erent criteria, for the period May 1995
 to December 1996, the CNDH eprted 303 findings of arbitrary detention and 36
 cases in which it found that authorities held prisoners incommunicado. The human
 rights commission for the Federal District reported 272 complaints of arbitrary de-
 tention for the period from October 1995 to September 1996. It found the most com-
 mon complaint to be delay in the administration of justice, with 602 complaints. The
 commission was critical of numerous arrest orders in the Federal District being ig-
 nored or unresolved.
 On March 3, the police arbitrarily detained two Jesuit priests in Palenque,
 Chiapas (see Section 2.c.).
 In April 1995, the police arrested Mauricio Franco Sanchez for physically blocking
 efforts to build a golf course in an environmentally protected area in Tepztlan,
 Morelos. In January 1996, a court sentenced Franco to a term of 10 years and 7
 months, but he was released in July 1996. The police also arrested Jose Carillo
 Conde and Gerardo Demesa Padilla, members of the Tepoztlan United Committee
 (CUT), who protested construction of the golf course and held them on charges of
 participating in a murder. Several human rights groups contended that the police
 were really holding these individuals because they protested construction of the golf
 course. Jose Carillo was released in October 1996, together with Fortino Mendoza,
 another CUT activist who had been arrested in October 1995. In September Demesa
 was sentenced to 8 years in prison for being an accessory to manslaughter in the
 death of Pedro Margarto Barragan Gutierrez. He is appealing the sentence. On De-
 cember 11, the CNDH recommended that Demesa be released from prison for lack
 of credible evidence against him. The CNDH also recommended that the local au-
 thorities investigate apparent acts of corruption in handling communal territory and
 that they canceItheproject. In response to local protests, the developers of the pro-
 posed golf course and housing and resort complex canceled the project in April 1996.
 Detention of opposition political activists is neither widespread nor systematic.
 Nevertheless, there were scattered reports of such detentions.
 Judges often failed to sentence indigenous detainees within legally mandated peri-
 ods. For the period from June 1994 to December 1996, the CNDH reviewed 8,661
 files of indigenous persons detained in Mexican jails. The Commission recommended
 the immediate release of 1,727 persons in 1996. By the end of 1996, the authorities
 had released 998 of them; 729 cases were still pending. Of those states with the
 largest numbers of indigenous prisoners, the CNDH reviewed 2,222 cases in Oaxaca,
 and recommended 407 releases, of which 296 have been accomplished; 1,219 cases
 in Veracruz, with 331 recommendations for release and 245 releases; and 639 cases
 in Puebla, with 157 releases recommended, and 61 releases.
 Federal prosecutors continued to adhere to the recommendation by the National
 Indigenous Institute (INI) that they drop charges against first-time offenders ac-
 cused of drug cultivation, as drug traffickers often forced indigenous defendants,
 who do not understand the legal significance of their actions, to grow the crops. The
 INI also supports programs to provide translators for indigenous defendants and to
 assist them in obtaining bail bonds.
 Many detainees report that officials ask them to pay bribes for release before for-
 mal arraignment; many of those arrested report that they are able to bribe officials
 to have them drop charges before they go before a judge. Corruption is rampant
 throughout the system.
 The law does not permit exile, and it is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial-The judiciary is nominally independent; however,
 on occasion it has been influenced by the executive branch. Corruption and ineffi-
 
 
 ciency are problems and are more widespread in some states than others. Judicial
 reforms have begun to address some of these problems.
 The federal court system is composed of 183 district courts, 74 circuit courts of
 appeal, and a Supreme Court. In 1995 President Zedillo proposed and Congress ap-
 proved extensive judicial reform legislation. These reforms included: selecting most
 lower and appellate federal court judges and law secretaries by competitive exami-
 nations; creating an independent judicial council to administer the federal courts
 (except the Supreme Court, which administers itself); and requiring two-thirds of
 the Senate to confirm the appointment of a Supreme Court justice. The reforms also
 provided the Supreme Court with the authority to strike down a law for unconsti-
 tutionality (one-third of the Congress, one-third of a state congress, or the Attorney
 General must ask the Supreme Court to review the constitutionality of a law before
 it can be declared unconstitutional).
 Efforts to implement these reforms continued throughout the year. The judicial
 council created 27 new judicial tribunals and plans to create 20 more; established
 the basis and procedures for selecting new members of the judiciary and for promot-
 ing and transferring current members; conducted reviews of the performance of 48
 judges during their initial 6-year probationary period prior to granting life tenure
 (three did not receive tenure); determined 151 new assignments and 180 reassign-
 ments of judges; hancled 1,025 administrative complaints and found 70 to be well
 based; and reconstituted the institute in charge of training of the federal judiciary.
 Since the creation of the federal judicial council in early 1995 to the end of the
 year, seven judges have been investigated for the alleged protection they granted
 to criminals, including drug traffickers. Some of these judges are accused of having
 abused the ampar (a writ protecting one's constitutional rights) to benefit the ac-
 cused criminals. Other judges face investigations for the lenient sentences they
 handed down in specific cases of serious crimes. The PGR has begun formal legal
 proceedings only in three of the seven cases. In two other cases, the PGR forwarded
 administrative complaints against the judges to the federal judicial council. These
 complaints allege inefficiency in the accomplishment of legal proceedings; and the
 two judges do not face criminal charges. The remaining two judges are being inves-
 tig     or allegedly committing irregularities in the performane oftheir duties.
 The judicial trial system is based on the Napoleonic code and consists of a series
 of fact-gathering hearings at which the court receives documentary evidence or testi-
 mony. In addition, officials may add notarized documents to the official case file
 without authentication. A judge in chambers reviews the case file and makes a final
 written ruling based thereon. The record of the proceeding in not available to the
 public; only the parties and, by special motion, the victim may have access to the
 official file. The Constitution provides for the right of the accused to attend the
 hearings and challenge the evidence or testimony presented, and the Government
 respects these rights in practice. In general, court hearings are open to the public
 and it is ommon to findnot only the accused hut also relatives antdjournalists in
 the court rooms.
 Journalists covering judicial proceedings must rely on statements of attorneys out-
 side the courtroom as to what occurred inside. A judge in chambers reviews the case
 file and makes a final written ruling based thereon. The record of the proceeding
 s not available to the public; only the parties and, by special motion, the victim may
 have access to the official file.
 While there is a constitutional right to an attorney t anll stages of criminal pro-
 ceedig ing hpractice, the authorities often do not assure adequate representation for
 many poor defendants. Attorneys are not always available during the questioning
 of defendants; in some instances a defense attorney will attempt to represent sev-
 eral ciet   utentiutan    b  entering different rooms to certify that he was
 present although he did not actually attend the fulproceedings. In th a e of in-
 igenous defendants, many of whom do not speak Spanish, the situation is often
 worse. The courts do not routinely furnish translators for them a t all stages of
 criminal proceedings, and thus defendants may be unaware of the status of their
 cThe law does not require civil trial of soldiers involved in civil crimes, and the
 military continues to handle such cases. The Constitution provides for military juris-
 diction for crimes or offenses involving any violation of military discipline. In cases
 in which a member of the military commits a crime and is arrested by civil authori-
 ties, the military has the right to immediatel request transfer of the case to mili-
 tary jurisdiction. The Constitution allows civi  authorities to assume jurisdiction
 in cases involving military personnel accused of common offenses. Several NGO's
 complained about the growing militarization of the country and expressed the fear
 that military abuses would not be subject to civil jurisdiction. This remains a subject
 
 
 578
 of ongoing public debate, with some sectors of society in favor of greater use of the
 military to combat crime.
 Some human rights groups claim that activists arrested in connection with land
 disputes and other civil disobedience activities are in fact political prisoners. The
 Government asserts that the system fairly prosecutes those charged in sometimes
 violent land invasions for common crimes, such as homicide and damage to prop-
 erV.
 rt. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the rights to privacy, family, home, and correspondence.
 The law requires search warrants, but there are credible claims that unlawful
 searches =thout warrants are common.
 Police evicted peasants from their homes and destroyed the homes of peasant
 leaders in the state of Veracruz (see Section l.a.).
 In November 1996, Congress passed the federal Law against Organized Crime
 which, among other changes, allows for electronic surveillance with a judicial order.
 The law prohibits electronic surveillance in cases of electoral, civil, commercial,
 labor, or administrative matters.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law In Internal Con-
 flicts.-There were no reported clashes between troops stationed in Chiapas and the
 EZLN during 1997. Negotiations between the EZLN and the Government have not
 pro'ressed since January. The Government contends that it remains committed to
 implementation of the San Andres accords on the rights of indigenous peoples and
 to a negotiated settlement. In September the EZLN organized a peaceful march on
 Mexico City to demand, among other things, implementation of the agreement on
 indigenous rights. A political movement, the Zapatista National Liberation Front
 (FZLN), was launched in September to pursue Zapatista goals through political ac-
 tion. The Government has invited the EZLN to recommence negotiations, but the
 EZLN refused to return to the dialog until the Government takes steps that the
 EZLN believes are necessary to implement the San Andres accords. The Govern-
 ment welcomed the EZLN march on Mexico City and the creation of the FZLN as
 representing a shift from military to political action.
 The military continues to deny any responsibility for abuses committed during the
 early stages of the Chiapas rebellion in 1994. The military authorities who have ju-
 risdiction failed to punish any military personnel or government officials for commit-
 ting abuses, although the CNDH issued an interim report in May 1994 finding that
 there was reason to believe that the military had injured or killed civilians in aerial
 attacks, and that there were summary executions, illegal detentions, and instances
 of torture.
 In January 1994, the army occupied the town of Ejido Morelia in the state of
 Chiapas. The army allegedly took three men into the church where they were tor-
 tured before being taken away. Their bodies were found 3 days later in a nearby
 town. This case was been brought before the Inter-American Commission on Human
 Rights (IACHR). The IACHR made a number of recommendations to the Govern-
 ment in October, which reportedly included that the Government appoint a special
 prosecutor, take legal action against the accused, and make payments to the victims'
 amilies. The Government was given 3 months to respond to the recommendations;
 the authorities have said that they are prepared to punish those responsible.
 In May and June, the EPR launched small-scale attacks against the military in
 Guerrero. Prior to the July 6 elections, the EPR declared a truce. Following the elec-
 tions, an EPR leader told the press that the EPR did not plan to launch attacks
 in the near future because such actions would not command popular support.
 Sweeps conducted by police and military personnel searching for the EPR resulted
 in a number of arrests. Many NGO's expressed concern that the security forces tor-
 tured some of the detainees. There were reports of torture in connection with arrests
 by security forces searching for members of the EPR in the state of Guerrero. Sol-
 diers detained Jose Nava Andrade, a member of the Organization of Towns and Set-
 tlers of Guerrero, in July 1996 and allegedly tortured him in an attempt to force
 him to confess membership in the EPR.
 Amnesty International reported that in July 1996, Hilario Mesino Acosta, an
 OCSS leader in Guerrero, was arrested in Mexico City on charges of participating
 in violent activities. He was allegedly tortured and threatened. Previously, his
 daughters had received death threats after lodging complaints about the Aguas
 Blancas massacre. The CNDH examined the arrest warrants executed for Mesino
 and interviewed him 2 days after his arrest. According to the CNDH, Mesino denied
 that he had been mistreated and was aware of the judicial events leading to his de-
 tention. A CNDH expert verified that Mesino showed no signs of mistreatment.

 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government generally respects these rights in practice.
 Mass media are not subject to formal censorship from any element of government.
 The media environment is complex. The meda are more free and independent
 than at any time in the country's history. Yet, there are more credible reports of
 attacks on journalists in the exercise of their profession than in recent years. Many
 of these attacks are carried out by drug trafficking organizations or by corrupt secu-
 rity personnel in the pay of such groups.
 In the capital and in other major urban centers, the media show a high degree
 of editorial independence. Direct criticism of the Government, especially in print
 media, is severe and commonplace. Television news and public affairs programs are
 no longer the automatic "propaganda services for the President and top officials" de-
 scribed by the Committee to Protect Journalists as recently as 1995. Television pro-
 vided full and generally balanced coverage of all political parties during the 1997
 electoral campaign and continued to do so after the elections.
 A complex set of relationships has developed between the media and the Govern-
 ment over the years. Some elements of that relationship are diminishing; others
 continue to tilt the editorial independence of many news organizations toward the
 Government. The key elements of that system are: coincidence of interest between
 media owners and the Government; broadcast licensing; official advertising (some
 of it disguised as news coverage); a state-run newsprint sales company; and a vari-
 etyof cash and noncash payments to journalists from various levels of government.
 The greatest concentration of official influence is in television. Television broad-
 casters give a contribution of air time-in the form of a 12.5 percent tax on advertis-
 ing revenues-instead of actual cash payments. This system lowers effective tax
 rates of the broadcasters and assures the Government access to this powerful me-
 dium.
 Greater pluralism in government and generational change in media leadership
 are beginning to separate government and media interests at the top. Following a
 prolonged fight for control of the corporation, the new director of the media giant
 Televisa publicly stated his commitment to editorial independence. This was in
 marked contrast to his predecessor's publicly stated pride in being a "soldier for the
 PRI." A court settlement in August of tax fraud charges brought by the Government
 against the owner of one of Mexico City's leading dailies also reflected the gradual
 dissolution of traditionally close interests between media owners and the Govern-
 ment.
 However, the Government still has the power to grant or withdraw broadcast li-
 censes. Media observers have privately alleged that the Government delays issuance
 of broadcast licenses as an implicit control over broadcasters. There have also been
 printed allegations of favoritism by the Government in granting broadcast licenses.
 None of those allegations has ever been proven. Media observers maintain, however,
 that the ability to grant or withdraw broadcast licenses leads to self-censorship in
 some broadcast media.
 The most serious problem during the past year was the increasing number of
 credible reports of attacks on journalists. In May the CNDH revamped its proce-
 dures for monitoring reported attacks on journalists. Rather than wait for formal
 omplaints (which numbered 13 from May 1996 to May 1997), the CNDH began
 opening cased based on media reports, and it contacted the affected parties and oth-
 ers who may have information. This invigorated approach led to 80 new investiga-
 tions between May and the end of the year. Most reports received by the CNDH
 continued to be from outside Mexico City, and most continued to describe violent
 acts or intimidation, rather than murder of a journalist.
 Mexico City media reported that there were 10 homicides of journalists during the
 year in other parts of the country. Attorney General Madrazo publicly committed
 the PGR at the federal level to investigate all murders of journalists, which is sig-
 nificant because homicide investigations are normally the responsibility of state
 level officials. The most widely publicized death of a journalist in the conduct of his
 profession was the July murder of Benjamin Flores Gonzalez, owner and editor of
 the daily newspaper La Prensa, in San Luis Rio Colorado, Sonora. Unknown assail-
 ants shot Flores Gonzalez while he was returning to his office. Flores Gonzalez'
 aer had aggressively overed the drug trade in Sonora, including a story pub-
 ished in May, that reported the disappearanc of a half ton of seized cocaine from
 Federal Judicial Police headquarters in San Luis Rio Colorado. The police arrested
 Rolando Arroyo Palacios, whom they said killed Flores Gonzales on the orders of a
 jailed drug trafficker. Police also arrested Luis Enrique Rincon Muro and Vidal
 Zamora Lara in the killing.
 
 
 580
 In November gunmen using automatic rifles opened fire on the vehicle of Jesus
 Blancornelas, founder and editor of Zeta, a Tijuana weekly. The assailants seriously
 wounded Blancornelas and killed his assistant- one of the attackers was killed.
 Press reports ascribed the attack to narcotics trafickers.
 In June Leonicio Pintor Garcia, a correspondent of the daily El Sol in
 Chilpancingo, Guerrero, was found dead in or near the Ajolotero river. NGO reports
 stated that the body showed signs of torture. In late May, Jesus Bueno Leon, the
 editor of the weekly Siete Dias in Chilpancingo, Guerrero, was found shot in the
 head near the Chilpancingo-Tixtla highway. Bueno Leon reportedly was one of
 seven journalists at Siete Dias being sued for defamation by former Guerrero sec-
 retary of state Ruben Robles Catalan following the publication of reports that tied
 the state governor to a 1995 murder of a local lawyer by police.
 There were no murders of journalists reported in Mexico City. There were, how-
 ever, increasingly credible reports of harassment of journalists who work for na-
 tional media. The Mexico City daily, Reforma, reported that two of its reporters
 were kidnaped and detained on separate occasions in August and September. The
 earlier kidnaping, by unidentified perpetrators, occurred while a reporter was inves-
 tigating the disappearance of a police officer who reportedly had been in the pay
 of drug kingpin Amado Carrillo Fentes. According to reports in Reforms, the sec-
 ond kidnaping was perpetrated by Federal Judicial Police, who questioned the re-
 porter about his sources on several narcotics related stories for several hours before
 releasing him.
 Reputable journalists with other national media institutions have remarked pri-
 vately that they have been summoned to police agencies in Mexico City where they
 were similarly asked about stories they were pursuing, including their sources. The
 journalists did not allege detention or mistreatment, but understood an implicit, po-
 tential threat to their ability to report.
 In response to the increased number of attacks on journalists and heightened at-
 tention by Mexican and international NGO's, on September 18, President Zedillo
 publicly condemned such attacks and instructed the Mexico City attorney general's
 office and the Mexico City police to investigate these acts.
 The Constitution recognizes academic freedom in higher education, and the Gov-
 ernment respects this prevision in practice.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of assembly, and the Government respects this right in practice. The only
 requirement for holding demonstrations is that groups wishing to meet in public
 areas inform local police authorities; public demonstrations are held frequently.
 The Constitution provides for the right to organize or affiliate with political par-
 ties, and the Government respects this right in practice. Opposition and independ-
 ent associations functioned freely without government interference or restriction.
 The Federal Electoral Code recognizes national political associations. Such political
 associations can participate in elections through an agreement with one political
 party but are not allowed to use their names or symbols during the election cam-
 paigns. Private associations do not have legal status until they receive their official
 designation from the Federal Electoral Institute. In November 1996, the IFE recog-
 nized 24 citizen organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for the right to practice the re-
 ligion of one's choice, and the authorities generally respect this right in practice.
 However, local authorities sometimes infringed on this right (see Section 5). The law
 bars clergy from holding public office and from advocating partisan political posi-
 tions.
 The federal Office of Religious Affairs actively promotes religious tolerance and
 held symposiums in July 1996 in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas emphasizing the
 constitutional right of freedom of religion.
 On March 3, in Palenque, Chiapas, two Jesuit priests, Jeronimo Alberto Hernan-
 dez and Gonzalo Resas Morales, were arbitrarily detained. According to witnesses,
 police in civilian clothes and judicial police, supported by local police, removed the
 two priests from their vehicle and transported them to Tuxtia Gutierrez. On the
 way to Tuxtla, the priests report having been beaten by the police. The police had
 no arrest order and did not inform the priests of the reason for their detention. The
 police informed the Fray Bartolome Human Rights Center, by telephone, that the
 "priests were accused of participating in an ambush on March 2 in which two police
 officers were killed and five were wounded. A judge subsequently released the
 priests, for lack of evidence, on March 13.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for the right of free movement, and the Gov-
 ernment does not generally restrict movement of its citizens into, out of, or within
 the country.
 
 
 The law provides protection for foreigners who face political persecution.
 Illegal immigrants rarely file charges in cases of crimes committed against them.
 The authorities generally immediately deport illegal immigrants who come to their
 attention; therefore, a pending case brought by an illegal immigrant is subject to
 dismissal once the immi ant has been deported.
 Until 1995 children who were in Mexico illegally did not have the right to matric-
 ulate in public schools. According to new Education Secretariat guidelines, any child
 may now be registered for public school with a Mexican or foreign birth certificate.
 Implementation of the new guidelines varies widely from state to state, however.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees (JNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.
 With the UNHCR, the Government assisted with the repatriation of Guatemalan
 refugees desiring to return home who had fled their country during the civil war
 in the 1980's and granted others wishing to stay in Mexico official immigrant resi-
 dency status. The Government agrees, in practice, with the principle of first asylum
 and reviews each claim on a case-by-case basis with the assistance of the UNHCR.
 The UNHCR worked with an intragovernmental commission called the Mexican
 Commission for Refugee Assistance in a program to repatriate Guatemalan refu-
 gees. Guatemalan refugees are mostly located in Chiapas (18,000), Campeche
 (10 000) and Quintana Roo (3,000). In 1996 3,973 Guatemalans were repatriated,
 and by July, an additional 1,639 had been repatriated. In addition, the Government
 offered the option to become legal residents to the refugees in Campeche and Quin-
 tana Roo; 85 percent accepted.
 Between January and May Mexico expelled 18,984 Guatemalans, 12,934
 Hondurans, 8,646 Salvadorans, and 547 Nicaraguans. Many of those expelled were
 en route to the northern border with the United States. There were no reports of
 forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right peacefully to change their gov-
 ernment through periodic elections. The PRI dominates politics and has controlled
 the Government since the party was founded in 1929. It has won every presidential
 election since then and has maintained power, in part, by relying on public patron-
 age, use of government and party organizational resources, and, in the past, elec-
 toral fraud. However, the Government no longer restricts the functioning of political
 opponents. Electoral reforms approved in 1996 and implemented in 1997 marked a
 transition from the traditional political system. While the PRI continues to be the
 dominant party, political change is altering the nation's politics, and opposition par-
 ties are gaining strength on both the national and local levels.
 On July 6, elections were held for all 500 seats in the lower house of Congress,
 one-quarter of the Senate, 6 state governors (Campeche, Colima, Queretaro, Sonora,
 San Luis Potosi, and Nuevo Leon), and over 1,000 state and local office holders in
 7 states and Mexico City. The congressional elections were a historic turning point.
 For the first time since the party's founding, the PRI lost its absolute majority in
 the lower house of Congress. In addition, for the first time since the 1920's, the peo-
 ple of Mexico City directly elected the mayor. PRD candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas
 won this race by a clear margin. There were pst-electral disputes in a few states
 including Colima and Campeche, and there was small-scale violence in Chiapas.
 (Ballots were burned in about 90 polling stations, out of over 1,100 in the state and
 over 100,000 nationwide.) The elections were seen by Mexican and international ob-
 servers as largely free and fair and as a significant advance in the democratization
 process.
 As a result of the package of electoral reforms approved by the Congress and
 I       y       Zedillo in 1996, the Federal Electoral Institute (WE), operating
 wit Vful autenomy, organized the federal elections for the Congress and, this year
 only, for the mayor of Mexico City. (In subsequent elections, Mexico City is to have
 its own electoral commission.) The FE implemented extensive onstitutional and
 legislative reforms passed in 1996 to help prevent electoral fraud and to "level the
 playing field" for the political parties by regulating campaign finance, advertising,
 and other measures. The IFE also provided support to state electoral institutes in
 running state and local elections and was instrumental in overhauling electoral dis-
 trict boundaries to reflect demographic shifts.
 Although there is no systematic exclusion of women and indigenous persons, they
 are underrepresented in politics. Women, however, hold numerous congressional
 seats and continue to increase their representation in political offices. At the begin-
 ning of his administration, President Zedillo appointed three women to the cabinet:
 the Comptroller General, the Secretary of Tourism, and the Secretary of the Envi-
 
 
 582
 ronment, Natural Resources, and Fisheries. In addition, after the July elections,
 there were 87 women in the 500-member Chamber of Deputies and 19 in the 128-
 member Senate.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate largely without government re-
 striction, investigating and publishing their findings onhuman rights cases. Govern-
 ment officials are generally cooperative and responsive to NGO views, and the Con-
 ge s has established a citizen participation committee to act as a liaison with
 GO's. In July 1996, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights visited
 Mexico at the invitation of President Zedillo and met with over a hundred human
 rights groups. In August the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture visited
 and met with government officials and members of NGO's. In September the sec-
 retary general of Amnesty International visited Mexico and met with high ranking
 members of the Government including Attorney General Madrazo, as well as with
 members of prominent human rights NGO's.
 However, many serious problems remain. For example, leaders and members of
 numerous human rights NGO's received death threats for criticizing the human
 rights situation in the country. These included members of the Miguel Agustin pro
 Juarez Center for Human Rights (PRODH) in Mexico City; its director, father David
 Fernandez Davalos; and Jose Lavanderos Ynez, Pilar Noriega, Digna Ochoa, Victor
 Brenes, and Enrique Flota, PRODH lawyers representing alleged members of the
 EZLN. Death threats were also received by Araceli Munoz, a member of the Chris-
 tian Action for the Abolition of Torture in Mexico City, and other civil rights activ-
 ists and politicians. For example, in July Leticia Moctezuma Vargas received threats
 because of her involvement in Tepoztlan. Graco Ramirez Abreu, PRD state congress-
 man in Morelos, also received death threats in October for campaigning against
 human rights violations by the police.
 The CNDH has established a program to assist threatened activists in filing a
 omplaint and obtaining protection. After filing an official omplaint, the Govern-
 ment is in a position to offer protective services through the Mexico City attorney
 general's office. For example, beginning in October 1996, the judicial police have
 monitored the offices of the Miguel Augustin pro Juarez Center for Human Rights
 in 24-hour shifts. In addition, at the group's request the Mexico City Attorney Gen-
 eral's office installed a closed circuit fixed camera and monitor, and a video recorder
 to tape the signal and two external views. The Attorney General's office also estab-
 lished a government group to follow up on the investigation, but it had not yielded
 conclusive results by year's end as to who was behind these threats. Moreover,
 NGO's are concernedabut the intrusive nature of the police protection.
 To address human rights abuses, the Government established the CNDH in 1990.
 Between May 1996 and May 1997, the CNDH received a total of 8,509 new cases
 and continued to process the 1,323 cases that carried over from the previous year.
 By May the CNDH had concluded 8,456 of the total of 9,832 cases; 1,376 were in
 various stages of processing.
 For the period from May 1996 to May 1997, the CNDH made 126 recommenda-
 tions to government authorities. Of these, the authorities showed proof of having
 fully complied with 27 and partially complied with 92. The authorities accepted six
 recommendations without showing proof of compliance and six others pending pres-
 entation of proof of compliance. An additional 32 cases were pending. During the
 same period, the CNDI's efforts resulted in the sanctioning of 123 public servants,
 of which 25 were federal employees and 98 were state employees.
 Some NGO's note that the CNDH lacks both autonomy and enforcement author-
 ity. Additionally, some contend that it has become too large and bureaucratic, and
 that the state commissions are ineffectual. In part to address this concern, and also
 to improve its ability to comply with its international human rights obligations, the
 Government installed an interagency commission on human rights on November 6.
 The new commission is made up of the Secretaries of Foreign Relations, Defense,
 Navy, Interior, the Attorney General's office, and the CNDH. The commission is to
 develop a government policy on human rights to establish uniform procedures for
 interaction between government agencies and human rights organizations.
 In March 1995, the Federal District Attorney Generals office announced the open-
 ing of a new subsection for human rights to address abuses in Mexico City, by far
 the most populous jurisdiction. The oice handled an avera e of two complaints per
 day against Federal District police officers, as well as other cases. In December
 1996, the POR also opened an office to strengen communication with NGO's.
 Then-Defense Minister General Antonio Riviello imprisoned General Jose Fran-
 cisco Gallardo Redriguez in November 1993 on a range of charges, including embez-
 
 
 583
 zlement and dishonoring the military. Gallardo claims that the embezzlement
 charges which date back 7 years, had previously been abandoned for lack of evi-
 dence. HIe maintains that military authorities are persecuting him because of an
 academic dissertation calling for the establishment of a military human rights om-
 budsman's office. The army continues to hold Gallardo but has reduced the previous
 inordinately high level of security of his incarceration. The IACHR considered the
 Gallardo case in October 1996 and called for his immediate release and for the Gov-
 ernment to indemniify him for damages suffered as a result of his imprisonment.
 However, he remains in prison. In June his son, Marco Vinicio Gallardo Enriquez,
 who campaigned for his father's release, survived an attack by unidentified individ-
 uals in Mexico City.
 On Apnil 16, two foreign representatives of the International Federation of
 Human Rights (FIDH) arrived at an Acapulco prison to interview people accused of
 having links with the EPR. After examining their documents, the prison director
 discovered the two were in the country on the wrong type of visas, denied them ac-
 cess to the prison, and notified immigration authorities. At 1:00 a.m. on April 1?,
 immigration authorities went to the hotel where the FIDH representatives were
 staying and asked to review their documents. The immigration officers confirmed
 that the FIDH investigators did not have the type of visa required to conduct such
 interviews; rather, they had been issued tourist visas by Mexican consular officers.
 Although the CNDH requested that the representatives be allowed to remain in
 country, and the request was agreed to by immigration authorities, the two rep-
 resentatives were not officially granted this puermission prior to leaving Mexico on
 April 21. In May the CNDH recommended that an investigation be made into the
 be havior of the immigration authorities. As a result of this recommendation, the au-
 thorities disciplined a number of immigration officials and changed policies to avoid
 similar situations in the future.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 chal Status
 The Constitution states that men and women are equal before the law. It also pro-
 vides that education should sustain the ideals of "fraternity and equal rights of all
 mankind, avoidin privileges of race, sects, groups, sexes, or individuals." These pro-
 visions are not effectively enforced.
 Amnesty International cites Mexico as one of the countries in which homosexual
 men and women are most likely to be victims of abuse and violence. A number of
 homosexuals and male prostitutes have been killed in recent years. There was no
 progress in the investigation of the killings of at least 12 homosexuals and 9 male
 prostitutes in Tuxtla Gutierrez between 1991 and 1993. An independent prosecutor
 took over the investigation of the Tuxtla Gutierrez murders in April 1994 but had
 made no progress in solving them by the end of 1997.
 Women.- he most pervasive violations of women's rights involve domestic and
 sexual violence, which is believed to be widespread and vastly underreported.
 Women are reluctant to report abuse or file charges, and, even when notified, the
 ice are reluctant to intervene in what society considers to be a domestic matter.
 e municipality of Chimahuacan, Mexico state, where the average time for police
 action on rape cases is 2 months, is a typical example of the difficulty that rape
 victims experience. This is attributable to police inexperience in handling these
 cases, lack of investigative techniques, and unwillingness to get involved in what
 are often considered domestic affairs.
 In December Congress passed a legislative reform initiative on intrafamily vio-
 lence proposed by the President. The new law has three main objectives: to discour-
 age and punish intrafamily violence, establish protective measures for victims, and
 educate the public. The legislation expanded the crime of rape to include spousal
 rape, involving married or common law couples.
 Under certain circumstances limited to statutory rape of a minor between the
 ages 12 and 18, the Criminal Code provides that a judge may dismiss the charges
 ifmthe persons involved voluntarily marry. In practice, this provision is rarely in-
 voked.
 In Mexico City, during the first 8 months of the year, the Center for Family Vio-
 lence (CAVI) received 8,760 cases and assisted 11,732 people. The CAVI provided
 counseling to 2,684 crime victims. During 1996, the Special Agency for Sexual
 Crimes received 5,643 complaints. Rape was the most reported sexual crime with
 1,693 reported cases, 48.2 percent of the total; followed by sexual abuse, 1,053 cases;
 and attempted rape, 179 cases. The Center for Support for Victims of Sexual Crimes
 provided counseling to 10,822 people in 1996, and in 1,611 cases it provided legal
 support. The Mexico City Attorney General's office provided legal assistance to
 crime victims through a special unit (ADEVI) which was created in 1994. Between
 
 
 584
 January and August, the ADEVI assisted 7,655 people and sent 1,592 cases to the
 appropriate authorities. The ADEVI also helped to obtain $210,583 for compensation
 to some of the victims.
 Although the Constitution provides for equality between the sexes, neither the au-
 thorities nor society ingeneral respect this in practice. The legal treatment of wom-
 en's rights is uneven. Women have the right to own property in their own names
 and to file for separation and divorce. However, in some states a woman may not
 bring suit to establish paternity and thereby obtain child support, unless the child
 was a product of rape or cohabitation; the child resides with the father; or there
 is written proof of paternit.
 The Constitution and labor law provide that women shall have the same rights
 and obligations as men, and "equal pay shall be given for equal work performed in
 equal jobs, hours of work and conditions of efficiency." However, women are gen-
 er~ally paid less and are oncentrated in lower paying occupations. Labor law in-
 cludes extensive maternity protection, including 6 weeks off before and 6 weeks off
 after childbirth, time off or breast feeding in adeqate and hygienic surroundings
 provided by the employer, and, during pregnancy, fill pay and no dismissals, heavy
 or dangerous work or exposure to toxic substances. There are reports that, in order
 to avoid these expensive requirements, some employers deliberately violate these
 provisions by requiring pregnancy tests in preemployment physicals and by exposing
 pregnant women to difficult or hazardous conditions to make them quit; this report-
 edly occurs particularly in the low-wage, low-skill, high-turnover end of the in-bond
 export processing (maquila) industry.
 These reports claim that state and (for health and safety) federal labor authorities
 are unable or unwilling to enforce those provisions. Human Rights Watch/Americas,
 joined by the International Labor Rights Fund, and the (Mexican) National Associa-
 tion of Democratic Lawyers, followed up its August 1996 report on these problems
 by filing on May 15 a submission with the U.S. National Administrative Office
 (AO), under provisions of the NAFTA labor side agreement. The U.S. NAO accept-
 ed the submission for review on July 14. The Government criticized the methodology
 of the Human Rights Watch/Americas study, stressing that only 50 workers in 43
 plants (8 of which had been closed) were interviewed when more than 500,000
 women work in more than 3,000 maquiladoras. Since publication of the report, some
 firms have discontinued the practice of preemployment pregnancy testing and others
 have initiated a review of procedures related to physical examinations for current
 and prospective employees.
 In order to protect women's labor rights, the Ministry of Labor made 23,138 safety
 and hygiene inspections in private factories and public institutions during 1996.
 However, while the Government increased the number of federal inspectors during
 the year and negotiated agreements with an increasing number of state govern-
 ments to expand and better coordinate labor inspections, the number of maquila
 plants far outstripa what state and federal inspectors can handle.
 In 1995 the CNDHfod that the larest number of omplaints against health
 care institutions involved negligence or abuse during childbirth by medical person-
 nel and charges of forced sterilization. It said that the number of such complaints
 had grown, in large part due to women's increased awareness of their rights. The
 Constitution states that all persons have the right to make free, responsible, and
 informed decisions on the number of children they choose to have. The 1984 General
 Health Law provides for criminal action against those who pressure a woman to un-
 dergo sterilization procedures or perform such procedures without the woman's con-
 sent. In a number of cases, charges have been brought against doctors for sterilizing
 a woman or inserting an IUD without her consent. The scope of this problem is dif-
 ficult to quantify, although a number of NGO's and government agencies follow the
 issue, because women may not realize that these procedures have been performed
 on them or may be reluctant to come forward and file a complaint. The CNDH has
 recommended that medical administrators train their staffs to be more aware when
 dealing with such patients. The Government has instituted a number of mecha-
 nisms, including better training and medical review boards, to address the problem.
 In February the Government initiated an antipoverty program called PASE in five
 of nine targeted microregions, designed to try to break the cycle of poverty by tying
 together health, education, and nutrition benefits, with special emphasis on women
 and girls. In August the Government renamed the program Progresa and planned
 to have it active in all 9 microregions in 13 states, in order to reach as many as
 500,000 of the country's poorest families by the end of the year.
 The Government created the National Women's Program to address the needs of
 women and children. According to its 1997 report, 3,876 women received literacy
 training, 3,540 maternity clinics are now open in 17 states serving extremely poor
 areas; and 13,227 family planning classes were given.
 
 
 585
 Children.-Children under the age of 18 make up over 40 percent of the popu-
 lation. While the Government is committed to children's health and education, it
 has failed to allocate sufficient resources to fulfill that commitment. Nine years of
 education are compulsory. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) classifies
 Mexico as "lacking adequate strategies" to combat malnutrition among children, and
 reports that 30,000 children die each year of causes related to malnutrition. Accord-
 ing to UNICEF, the department of the Federal District, and the National System
 for the Integral Development of the Family, in 1995, more than 13,000 children
 lived on the streets of Mexico City, manythe victims of family violence. This was
 a 20 percent increase from 1992. The children themselves often become involved
 with alcohol, drugs, prostitution, and petty thievery.
 While the Government and NGO's conduct a number of programs for street chil-
 dren, corrupt police exacerbate the problem by pressuring children to commit petty
 crimes and extorting profits from them. The CNDH has a program for the protection
 of children's rights, which includes educating children on their rights and reviewing
 legislation to ensure compliance with relevant international conventions.
 As an adjunct to the July 6 elections, IFE and UNICEF organized in the first chil-
 dren's elections ever held in the country. A total of 3.7 million children between the
 ages of 6 and 12 participate. Children voted on which of the nine basic rights en-
 sured by the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child they deem a priority.
 While there is no societal pattern of abuse against children, children's advocates
 reported many individual cases.
 People With Disabilities.-The law requires access for disabled persons to public
 facilities in Mexico City but not elsewhere in the country. In practice, however, most
 public buildings and facilities do not comply with the law. Recognizing that disabled
 persons often suffer employment discrimination, the Federal District instituted a
 tax rebate program in 1996 for businesses employing disabled persons. For the first
 time, in 1996 the public educaton sub-secretariat for the Federal District mandated
 that all pubic and private schools grant access to physically (although not mentally)
 disabled children and that schools make the necessary arrangements (e.g., installa-
 tion of ramps) to facilitate access.
 In late 1996, the CNDH published a pamphlet called "principal rights of people
 with disabilities" and a Braille edition of a handbook called first aid in human
 rights," which was distributed to organizations that work with the blind.
 Since 1995, the CNDH has made 11 visits to five institutions that care for dis-
 abled people and has issued two recommendations. The CNDH has also visited men-
 tally ill prisoners in 92 penitentiaries located in 17 states and has issued 13 rec-
 ommendations in response to their findings.
 Indigenous People. -The indigenous population has long been the victim of dis-
 criminatry treatment. The 1994 Chiapas uprising focused unprecedented attention
 on the demands of that state's indigenous persons for increased economic and social
 rights. Among its basic demands, the EZLN called on the Government to enact
 measures to protect indigenous cultures, provide more opportunity for employment,
 and invest in schools, clinics, and infrastructure projects. The Government, through
 the INI and the CNDH, operates programs to educate indigenous groups (many
 members of which do not speak Spanish) about their political and luman rights,
 and it generally professes respect obr their desire to retain elements of their tradi-
 tional culture. The CNDH organized training courses on human rights for indige-
 nous communities in Chiapas, Hidalgo, Mexico, Michoacan, Oaxaca, Chiapas and
 Nayarit. The courses were taught in the communities' indigenous languages.
 More than 130 NGO's are dedicated to the promotion and protection of indigenous
 rights. Indigenous people do not live on independently governed reservations, al-
 though some indigenous communities exercise considerable, local control over eco-
 nomic and social issues. These communities apply traditional law to resolve a vari-
 ety of disputes, including allegations of crimes. However, these groups remain large-
 ly outside the country's political and economic mainstream, a result of long-standing
 patterns of economic and social development and in many cases their ability to par-
 ticipate in decisions affecting their lands, cultural traditions, and allocation of natu-
 ral resources is negligible.
 Constitutional changes in 1996 expanded the rights of indigenous peoples to elect
 representatives to national office according to traditional sages and customs,"
 rather than standard electoral law.
 The 1992 reforms in agrarian law were expected to promote economic develop-
 ment in the countryside, but indigenous groups generally perceived the reforms as
 intended to break up indigenous communal landoldings and prevent the groups
 from obtaining title to new lands. A 1991 amendment to the federal law requires
 that an interpreter be present at every stage of criminal proceedings against indige-
 nous persons and stipulates that "their customs and traditions shall be taken into
 
 
 586
 account." However, the courts continue to sentence indigenous people without the
 benefit of interpreters. The CNDH had reviewed the cases of 7,823 jailed indigenous
 p ersons and sought the release of 1,887. Of those, 1,069 have been released since
 June 1994, largely through CNDH efforts.
 The General Education Act states that "teaching shall be promoted in the na-
 tional language (i.e., Spanish) without prejudice to the protection and promotion of
 indigenous languages. However, many indigenous persons speak only their native
 languages. Non-Spanish speakers are frequently taken advantage of in commercial
 transactions involving bilingual middlemen, and have great difficulty finding em-
 plo ment in Spanish-speaking areas. Over 50 indigenous languages are spoken.
 though the law provides some protection for the indigenous, and the Govern-
 ment provides indigenous communities support through social and economic assist-
 ance programs, legal provisions and social welfare programs are not sufficient to
 meet the needs of all indigenous persons.
 Religious Minorities.-In the highlands of Chiapas and other indigenous areas,
 traditional leaders sometimes acquiesced in, or actually ordered, the expulsions of
 Protestants belonging rimarily to evangelical groups. In many cases the expulsions
 involved the burmng fhomes and crops, beatings, and, occasionally, killings.
 Progovernment su pporters have accused the Catholic Church in the Chapas dio-
 cese of supporting the EZLN. On November 4, a pickup truck carrying supporters
 of bishop SamuelRuiz on a pastoral visit in northern Chiapas came under fire from
 unknown persons. Three people were wounded but no one was killed. The local au-
 thorities commenced an investigation, which remained open at year's end. On No-
 vember 6, the bishop's sister received an acquaintance at the church office in San
 Cristbal de Las Casas. This acquaintance attacked her with a hammer. The assail-
 aentaly ill. He re-
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the Federal Labor Law (LFT)
 provide workers with the right to form and join trade unions of their choice. About
 30 percent of the total work force is unionized, mostly in the formal sector, where
 about one-half the labor force is employed. This implies a formal sector unionization
 rate nearly twice that high.
 No prior approval is needed to form unions, but they must register with the Fed-
 eral Labor Secretariat (STPS) or state labor boards (JLCA) to obtain legal status
 in order to function. Registration requirements are not onerous. There are credible
 allegations, however, that the STPS or JLCA occasionally withhold or delay reg-
 istration of unions hostile to government policies, employers, or established unions
 or register extortionists or labor racketeers falsely climing to represent workers.
 To remedy this latter problem, STPS officials require evidence that unions are genu-
 ine and representative before registering them.
 Like the Federal Labor Board (JFCA), the JLCA are tripartite. Although trade
 union presence on the boards is a generally positive feature, it can lead to unfair
 partiality in representation disputes; the member from an established union may
 work to dissuade a JLCA from recognizing a rival organization. The matter of trade
 union registration was the subject of follow-up activities in 1996 and 1997, pursuant
 to a 1995 agreement reached in ministerial consultations under the North American
 Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC), the side agreement on labor to the
 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
 Unions form federations and confederations freely without government approval.
 Most unions belong to such bodies. They too must register to have legal status. The
 largest trade union central is the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), tradi-
 tionally a sector of the ruling PRI, but affiliation is individual. The relationship be-
 tween labor organizations and political parties was a topic of much discussion before
 and after the July 6 congressional elections. This issue was to be discussed within
 the PRI before the end of the year, but such a debate did not occur. The Federal
 Employee Union Federation (FSTSE), the Revolutionary Worker and Peasant Con-
 federation (CROC), and most of the separate national unions, smaller confed-
 erations, and federations in the Labor Congress (CT) are also allied with the PRI,
 but a number of them also reviewed the matter of party affiliation. However, several
 are not, including the large teachers' union, which severed its PRI ties several years
 ago, freeing its minority factions to cooperate openly with other parties, particularly
 the PRD. Rivalries within and between PRI-alliedycentrals are strong. There also
 are a few small labor federations and independent unions outside the CT that are
 not allied to the PRI. One is the small, left-of-center Authentic Labor Federation
 (FAT). Most FAT members sympathize with the PRD, but the FAT is independent
 and not formally tied to the PD. In November 160 labor organizations representing
 
 
 587
 workers in the private and public sectors, led by the telephone workers and social
 security workers unions, formed a labor central (National Union of Workers-UNT)
 in competition with the officially recognized CT.
 PRI-affiliated union officers traditionally have helped select, run as, and campaign
 for, PRI candidates in federal and state elections and support PRI government poi-
 cies at crucial moments. This gave unions considerable influence on government
 policies but limited their freedom of action to defend member interests in other
 ways, particularly when this might harm the Government or PRI. The CT, espe-
 cially the CTM, is well represented in the PRI senatorial and congressional delega-
 tions, although their numbers diminished somewhat after the July 6 elections.
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) Conference Committee of Experts
 (COE) has found that certain restrictions in federal employee labor law, adopted at
 FSTSE request, violate ILO Convention 87 on freedom of association, which Mexico
 has ratified. These provisions allow only one union per jurisdiction, forbid union
 members to quit the union, and prohibit reelection of union officials. Agan in 1997,
 the COE and the ILO Committee on Application of Standards (CAS) reiterated their
 criticism and asked the Government to amend these provisions. A 1996 Supreme
 Court decision invalidated similar restrictions in the laws of two states, but the de-
 cision applied only in the specific instances challenged.
 There were developments regarding union representation in the new environment,
 natural resources, and fisheries secretariat, an issue raised again in the CAS debate
 and in a submission under the NAALC (a public hearing was held on December 3,
 1996, bilateral consultations are underway on certain issues raised, and a related
 trilateral seminar was held on December 4, 1997, to discuss international legal
 questions raised as a result of the submission). This secretariat, formed late in 1994,
 merged the small former fisheries secretariat with much larger sections from the
 agricultural and social development secretariats. In early 1995, the fisheries sec-
 retariat union applied to the Federal Employee Labor Tribunal (TFCA) to change
 its name to union of the new secretariat. The TFCA denied the request. The TFCA
 is bipartite, with FSTSE as well as government members. Following the TFCA deci-
 sion, the FSTSE, applying its statutes, convoked a convention, with delegates elect-
 ed by secret ballot, to form a new union and elect its officers. The TFCA recognized
 the new union and withdrew recognition from the old. The new union thus benefited
 from the contractual relationship giving union delegates time off with pay for union
 work. The dissolved union appea ed to a court, wihich upheld the appeal and re-
 turned the matter to the TFC-a. The TFCa restored the fisheries unions registration
 and revoked that of the new union (again upholding the legal provision allowing
 registration of only one union per entity, violating ILO Convention 87). The unregis-
 tered union continued benefiting from time off and dues. The TFCA held a represen-
 tation election ("recount"-see Section 6.b.) for employees to choose by secret ballot
 between the two unions. The fisheries secretariat union lost by a wide margin but
 challenged the validity of the election, charging irregularities, however, the TFCA
 confirmed the election results. Subsequent court rulings in 1997 recognized the fish-
 eries secretariat union's right to function as a union in the new secretariat but con-
 firmed collective bargaining rights for the union that had won the election.
 In April 1996, the Federal District municipal government reached agreement with
 the jailed leaders of the Sutaur-100 union of the bankrupt former public municipal
 bus company Ruta-100. The Government agreed to concede and allow the union to
 operate two of the new private bus companies to replace Ruta-100. The Government
 also agreed to appeal to the courts to release the leaders from jail while Sutaur
 reached a settlement with the former members who had sued it to recover money
 from the union pension and other funds. The union leaders were released on bail
 in July 1996, and the first of the two union enterprises began operating at the end
 of the following month. In August the secretary general and legal advisor of Sutaur
 presented a complaint to the Attorney General alleging that federal police had
 blocked access to buses belonging to the Siglo Nuevo bus company (one of the two
 private companies that replaced Ruta-100), resulting in lost revenue amounting to
 about $15,000 (120,000 new pesos). Despite the resolution of this issue, the compa-
 nies continued to experience financial difficulties.
 The Constitution and the LFT provide for the right to strike. The law requires
 6 to 10 days' advance strike notice, followed by brief government mediation. If fed-
 eral or state authorities rule a strike "nonexistent" or "illicit," employees must re-
 main at work, return to work within 24 hours, or face dismissal. If they rule the
 strike legal, the company or unit must shut down totally, management officials may
 not enter the premises until the strike is over, and the company may not hire strik-
 er replacements. Provisions for maintaining essential services are not onerous. The
 law makes filing a strike notice an effective, commonly used threat, but few strikes
 actually occur, usually to protect a failing company's assets from creditors and
 
 
 588
 
 courts until an agreement is reached on severance pay. On the other hand, informal
 stoppages are a fairly common tactic, but are uncounted in statistics and seldom
 last long enough to be recognized or ruled out of order. The law permits public sec-
 tor strikes, but formal public sector strikes are rare. Informal ones are more fre-
 quent. Informal stoppages by dissident factions of the national teachers' union shut
 down many schools in several states and the Federal District in late May and June,
 and demonstrations disrupted traffic in the capital (but not to the extent that they
 had in 1996), until settlements were reached that included pay for strike days and
 unpaid overtime to make up lost work and complete the school year.
 During the first 11 months of 1997, the JFCA reported that 6,200 strike notices
 were filed and 38 legal strikes occurred in federal jurisdiction, 1,490 notices and 13
 strikes fewer than occurred in the same period in 1996. There were no reports that
 federal or state labor authorities stretched legal requirements to rule strikes non-
 existent or illicit, or used delays to prevent damaging strikes and force settlements.
 The Constitution and the LFT protect labor organizations from government inter-
 ference in their internal affairs, including strike decisions. This can protect undemo-
 cratic or corrupt union leaders. The law permits closed shop and exclusion clauses,
 allowing union leaders to vet and veto new hires and force dismissal of anyone the
 union expels. Such clauses are common in collective bargaining agreements.
 Employer organizations abandoned efforts to push for labor law reform. In effect,
 government, employers, and unions had negotiated reforms through tripartite na-
 tional agreements and collective bargaining at the enterprise level, and through co-
 operation in programs to increase, and compensate for, productivity. With govern-
 ment blessing, afr nearly a year of negotiation, national labor and employer orga-
 nizations agreed in August 1996 on a joint effort to build a new labor culture of mu-
 tual respect and cooperation to boost productivity, wages, and competitiveness. The
 three parties met regularly throughout 1997 to discuss ways and means for carrying
 out the objectives of the agreement.
 Unions are free to affiliate with, and are often active in, trade union internation-
 als.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution and the
 LFT strongly uphold the right to organize and bargain collectively. Interest by a few
 employees, or a union strike notice, compels an employer to recognize a union and
 negotiate, or ask the federal or state labor board to hold a union recognition elec-
 tion. LFT prounion provisions led some employers to seek out or create independent
 "white" or company unions as an alternative to mainstream national or local unions.
 Representation elections are traditionally open, not secret, although this seems to
 be changing. Traditionally, management and union officials are present with the
 presiding labor board official when workers openly declare their votes, one by one.
 Such open recounts are prevailing practice but are not required by law or regula-
 tion. Secret ballots are held when all parties agree.
 As the economic crisis deepened in 1995, the Government, at union insistence,
 agreed to end the system of annual national pacts negotiated by the Government
 and major trade union, employer, and rural organizations, which had voluntarily
 limited free collective bargaining for the past decade. Wage restraints no longer
 exist, except for those caused by the economic recession and difficult situation of
 most employers. The Government and major employer and union organizations met
 occasionally to reaffirm the 1996 Alliance for Economic Growth and agreed on new
 tax breaks or minimum wage increases, but the Government kept its commitment
 to free collective bargaining without guidelines or government interference. Wages
 in most union contracts appeared to keep pace with or ahead of inflation, but most
 workers had not yet regained buying power lost over the past decade. The alliance,
 however, was not renewed in October, as the negotiation shifted to the national
 Conrss, becoming part of the debate on the budget. In that context, the opposition
 PAN introduced a proposal in the Chamber of Deputies that would modify the LFT
 to make changes in the composition and role of the National Minimum Wage Com-
 mission.
 Mexico's record in internal union democracy and transparency is mixed. Some
 unions are democratic, but corruption or authoritarian and strong-arm tactics are
 common in others. A protest of such practices, which was initiated in 1996, involved
 factory committee leaders trying to improve conditions at a U.S.-owned maquila fac-
 tory in Sonora. The committee leaders were fired with the complicity of an allegedly-
 CTM "leader" who had a protection contract. The telephone union, representing the
 fired former factory committee leaders, the Federation of Goods and Services, and
 the Communications Workers of America filed a submission for review by the U.S.
 National Administrative Office, under provisions of the NAALC. The submission
 was accepted by the U.S. NAO for review in late fall of 1996 and a public hearing
 was set for April. The hearing did not take place because an interim agreement was
 
 
 589
 reached between the Government and the complainants. Hearings before a state
 labor board were to take place in Hermosillo, Sonora in August, but were postponed.
 There were indications that the complainants might seek to reopen the case.
 A similar case developed in Tijuana, Baja California, resulting in a disputed elec-
 tion on October 6 for the right to the collective bargaining contract for workers at
 a Korean-owned maquiladora. The contest, between a CROC-affiliated union and
 one associated with the FAT, resulted in a submission to the U.S. NAO, which was
 accepted for review on November 17. Subsequently, talks between the company and
 the workers, mediated by a state government official, stalled in mid-December over
 a union's insistence and the state government's refusal to sign as guarantor of the
 agreement to recognize an independent union to represent workers at the plant. The
 US. NAO scheduled public hearings for February 18, 1998.
 On December 16, 9 unions and 24 human rights NGO's jointly filed a submission
 with the US. NAO in another case involving the freedom of association linked to
 the right to organize unions. This case concerned allegations of strong arm tactics
 by a union affiated with the CTM to intimidate workers so that they would not
 vote in favor of a rival union to represent workers at a plant in La Paz, state of
 Mexico, which manufactures brake systems for motor vehicles.
 The public sector is almost totally organized. Industrial areas are heavily orga-
 nized. Even states with little industry have transport and public employee unions,
 and rural peasant organizations are omnipresent. The law protects workers from
 anti-union discrimination, but enforcement is uneven in the few states with low
 unionization.
 Unionization and wage levels in the in-bend export sector vary by area. Wages
 have been lower in this sector than in most of industry, especially in low technology
 facilities and in the west, but the gap has narrowed and may now be minimal. Some
 observers allege poor working conlitions, inadequate wages, and employer and gov-
 ernment efforts to discourage unionization in this sector. There is no evidence that
 the federal Government opposes unionization of the plants, which tend to be under
 state jurisdiction, but some state and local governments in the west are said to help
 some employers discourage unions.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor, which includes forced and bonded labor by children. There have been no credi-
 ble reports of forced labor for many years, with the exception of abuses of refugees
 and illegal immigrants in Chiapas (see Section 2.d.).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 bans child labor, including forced or bonded labor (see Section 6.c.). The law sets
 the minimum legal work age at 14 years. The activities of those 14 and 15 years
 of age are so restricted as to be uneconomic (no night or hazardous work and limited
 hours). The ILO reported that 18 percent of children 12 to 14 years of age work,
 often for parents or relatives. Enforcement is reasonably good at large and medium-
 sized companies, especially in export industries and those under federal jurisdiction.
 Enforcement is inadequate at the many small companies and in agrculture. It is
 nearly absent in the informal sector, despite government efforts. Most child labor
 is in the informal sector (including myriad underage street vendors), in family-
 owned workshops, or in agriculture and rural areas. The CTM agricultural union's
 success years earlier in obtaining free transport for migrant seasonal workers from
 southern states to fields in the north inadvertently led to a significant increase in
 child labor. The union and employers were unable to convince indigenous farm
 workers to leave their families at home, and many have settled near worksites in
 the north. The union has had some limited success in negotiating with employers
 to finance bilingual education near worksites and in obtaining social security child
 care centers, but it has had difficulty in persuading member families not to bring
 their children into the fields.
 The Federal Government increased the number of obligatory school years from 6
 to 9 in 1992 and made parents legally liable for their children's attendance, as part
 of a reform to upgrade labor force skills and long-term efforts to continue increasing
 educational opportunities for and participation by youth.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Constitution and the LFT provide for a
 daily minimum wage. The tripartite National Minimum Wage Commission (govern-
 mentj labor, and employers) usually sets minimum wage rates each December, effec-
 tive January 1, for the whole year, but any of the three parties can ask that the
 board reconvene during the year to consider a changed situation. In December 1996,
 the Wage Commission adopted a 17 percent increase, based in part on the Govern.
 meat's projection of a 15 percent annual inflation rate for 1997. Organized labor's
 unhappiness with the 17- percent increase (some labor organizations had demanded
 an increase of at least 25 percent) produced some suggestions that the official in-
 crease be challenged in court because it did not meet the constitutional requirement

 to be adequate to cover basic costs of living, including recreation. Labor leaders sev-
 eral times publicly called for an emergency increase in the minimum wage before
 the end of the year, but the Government and employers would not agree to such
 increases. However, during the course of the year, wage and benefit adjustments to
 collective bargaining contracts averaged between 20 and 23 percent.
 In Mexico City and nearby industrial areas, Acapulco, southeast Veracruz state's
 refining and petrochemical zone, and most border areas, the minimum daily wage
 was $3.39 (26.44 new pesos). However, employers actually paid minimum wage
 earners $3.86 (30.14 new pesos) due to a supplemental 14 percent fiscal subsidy
 (negative income tax or tax credit, which the Government refunds to employers).
 These income supplements to the minimum wage, agreed in annual tripartite pacts,
 are for all incomes less than four times the minimum wage, decreasing as wages
 and benefits rise. In Guadalajara, Monterrey, and other advanced industrialized
 areas, the minimum daily wage (before the fiscal subsidy) was $3.14 (24.51 new
 pesos). In other areas, it was $2.87 (22.48 new pesos). There are higher minimums
 or some occupations, such as building trades.
 Few workers (only 14 to 18 percent of the workers covered by social security) earn
 only the minimum wage. Industrial workers average three to four times the mini-
 mum wage, earning more at bigger, more advanced and prosperous enterprises.
 The law and contract arrangements provide workers with extensive additional
 benefits. Legally required benefits include free social security medical treatment and
 pensions, individual worker housing and retirement accounts, substantial Christmas
 bonuses, paid vacations, and profit-sharing. Employer costs for these benefits add
 from about 27 percent of payroll at marginal enterprises to over 100 percent at
 major firms with good union contracts. In addition, employers frequently subsidize
 the cost of meals, transportation, and day care for children, and pay bonuses for
 punctuality and productivity.
 The LFT sets 48 hours as the legal workweek, although with pay for 56 hours.
 Workers asked to exceed 3 hours of overtime per day or required to work overtime
 on 3 consecutive days must be paid triple the normal wage. For most industrial
 workers, especially under union contract, the true workweek is 42 hours, although
 they are paid for 7 full 8-hour days. This is why unions jealously defend the legal
 ban on hourly wages.
 The law requires employers to observe occupational safety and health regulations
 issued jointly by STPS and the Social Security Institute (IMSS), and to pay con-
 tributions that vary according to their workplace safety and health experience rat-
 ings. LFT-mandated joint management and labor committees set standards and are
 responsible for workplace enforcement in plants and offices. These meet at least
 monthly to consider workplace needs and file copies of their minutes with federal
 labor inspectors, who assumed jurisdiction for all such inspections in 1987, sup-
 planting state inspectors and considerably strengthening inspection. The inspectors
 schedule visits largely in response to these workplace committees.
 Individual employees or unions may also complain directly to inspectors or safety
 and health officials. Workers may remove themselves from hazardous situations
 without jeopardizing their employment. Plaintiffs may bring complaints before the
 federal labor board at no cost to themselves. The Federal Government established
 11 special labor arbitration and conciliation boards (in Queretaro, Pachuca, Ciudad
 del Carmen, Zacatecas, Orizaba, Ciudad Juarez, Cancun, Colima, La Paz, Reynosa,
 and Tijuana) to make it more convenient for workers to file complaints and bring
 other actions before the labor court system.
 STPS and IMSS officials report that compliance is reasonably good at most large
 companies. Federal inspectors are stretched too thin for effective enforcement if
 companies do not comply voluntarily and fulfill their legal obligation to train work-
 ers in occupational health and safety matters, although the number of inspectors
 was increased in 1995 and 1997. There are special problems in construction, where
 unskilled, untrained, poorly educated, transient labor is common, especially at many
 small sites and companies. Many unions, particularly in construction, are not orga-
 nized effectively to provide training, to encourage members to work safely and
 healthily, to participate in the joint committees, or to insist on their rights.
 The STSP completed work in 1996 on a comprehensive reform of regulations and
 procedures (resulting from extensive consultations through NAFTA cooperative
 mechanisms) concerning workplace health and safety. The reformed federal regula-
 tions on safety, hygiene, and environment in the workplace went into effect in April.
 The reformed regulations reduced to 168 articles in a single set of regulations what
 previously had been 1,353 articles in as many as six separate sets of regulations,
 some dating from as far back as 1934.
