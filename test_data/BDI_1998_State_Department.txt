 BURUNDI
 President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya was overthrown in a military coup in July
 1996. The regime headed by self-proclaimed interim    President, Major Pierre
 Buyoya, abrogated the 1992 Constitution and the 1994 Convention of Government.
 It promulgated a decree in September 1996 that replaced the Constitution during
 the so-called Transition Period. In April multiparty peace talks resumed in Arusha,
 Tanzania. On June 4, in conformity with an agreement between the Buyoya regime
 and the opposition-dominated National Assembly, the National Assembly adopted a
 Transitional Constitutional Act and a transitional political platform. The Transi-
 tional Constitutional Act supersedes the 1996 decree and the 1992 Constitution. The
 Act changed the structure of government; it eliminated the position of prime min-
 ister, created two vice presidents, removed the National Assembly Speaker from the
 line of presidential succession, and enlarged the National Assembly. The Act placed
 no time limits on the terms of office of the President or the National Assembly. The
 transitional political platform endorses in general terms restoring democracy, cor-
 recting the numerical ethnic imbalance of the army and judicial system, and cre-
 ation of an international tribunal to try crimes of genocide. On June 12, a new Gov-
 ernment was announced. The First Vice President and 10 of the 22 cabinet min-
 isters are members of the predominantly Hutu opposition party FRODEBU. On
 June 20, the President appointed a new Constitutional Court. On July 18, the Na-
 tional Assembly was expanded from 81 members to 121 members, Political parties
 
 
 and the National Assembly operate under significant restraints. The judicial system
 is controlled by the Tutsi minority.
 Buyoya holds power in conjunction with the Tutsi-dominated establishment forces.
 The country has been engaged in a civil war marked by ethnic violence, which in-
 cludes fighting between the Tutsi-dominated army and armed Hutu rebel groups.
 The fighting has caused widespread civilian casualties since the killing of democrat-
 ically elected president Melchior Ndadaye in October 1993.
 The security forces, which are controlled by the Tutsi minority, consist of the
 army and the gendarmerie under the Ministry of Defense; the Judicial Police under
 the Ministry of Justice; and the Documentation Service under the presidency. The
 army and the security services remain committed to protecting the interests of the
 Tutsi minority. The security forces committed numerous serious human rights
 abuses.
 Burundi is poor and densely populated, with over four-fifths of the population en-
 gaged in subsistence agriculture. The small modern sector, largely based on the ex-
 port of coffee and tea, has been damaged by an economic embargo imposed by neigh-
 boring states in 1996. The ongoing violence since 1993 has caused severe economic
 disruption and dislocation. Large numbers of internally displaced persons have been
 unable to produce their own food crops and largely depend on international humani-
 tarian assistance. Government efforts to privatize publicly owned enterprises are at
 a virtual halt. Per capita national income is estimated at less than $200 per year.
 The Government's human rights record remains poor. Citizens do not have the
 right to change their government. Members of the security forces continued to com-
 mit numerous serious human rights violations with impunity. Military forces com-
 mitted extrajudicial killings and, with their superior firepower, the armed forces
 committed the most widespread abuses. Armed troops killed both armed rivals and
 unarmed civilians, including women, children, and the elderly. Military forces mas-
 sacred unarmed civilian Hutus. Despite Buyoya's avowed intention to end abuses
 by the military forces, the Government largely was unable or unwilling to prevent
 them, and perpetrators generally were not punished. The continuing lack of account-
 ability for political and extrajudicial killings and ethnic violence, and continued im-
 punity for those responsible for the 1993 coup attempt and the ethnic massacres
 that followed have significantly contributed to national insecurity. There continued
 to be numerous disappearances. There were credible reports that security forces tor-
 tured prisoners. Prison conditions remain life threatening. Arbitrary arrest and de-
 tention and lengthy pretrial detention are problems, and there were reports of in-
 communicado detention. The court system suffers from a lengthy backlog. The dys-
 functional justice system could not address the country's problems effectively be-
 cause of its lack of independence, its inefficiency and administrative disruption, and
 the ethnic partiality of its officials. Authorities infringed on citizens' privacy rights.
 The Government controls nearly all the media. The Government restricts- freedom
 of assembly and does not permit political demonstrations. The Government restricts
 freedom of association and places some restrictions on freedom of movement. Inci-
 dents of ethnically motivated destruction and extrajudicial killing occurred through-
 out the country. Legal and societal discrimination against women continue to- be a
 problem; violence against women also occurs. The Twa (Pygmy) minority remains
 marginalized economically, socially, and politically. The Government cannot protect
 the rights of children or prevent discrimination against the disabled. There were
 some instances of forced labor.
 Hutu rebel forces committed numerous serious abuses, including massacres of
 both Hutu and Tutsi civilians.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Amnesty International estimates
 that since October 1993 approximately 200,000 persons have been killed in ethnic
 violence. An international relief organization estimated that approximately 900 per-
 sons per month were killed during the first 9 months of the year. According to an
 international human rights organization, the number of civilians killed during the
 year was about the same as in 1997.
 On January 4, soldiers reportedly killed 15 persons in the Mubone section of
 Kabezi commune, Bujumbura Rural province.
 On January 7, according to an international human rights organization, following
 a rebel attack on military vehicles that resulted in the deaths of four soldiers, sol-
 diers attacked the Kirekura section of Rubizi zone in Mutimbuzi commune,
 Bujumbura Rural province, and killed 16 civilians.
 
 
 On January 17, according to an international human rights organization, soldiers
 attacked the Burima section of Mutambu commune, Bujumbura Rural province, and
 killed 25 civilians. The majority of the victims were women and children, many of
 whom were killed in their homes.
 On March 21, according to an international human rights organization local mili-
 tary forces ordered civilians to leave the Sagadaro section of Isale commune,
 Bujumbura Rural province. When the civilians arrived at that commune's market-
 place, soldiers encircling the marketplace fired upon them, killing and wounding a
 number of persons.
 On May 11, according to an international human rights organization, soldiers
 fired on civilians in an internally displaced persons' camp located near a military
 position in Kayanza province, killing six civilians.
 On September 4, soldiers reportedly killed six children in an attack on a house
 in Isale commune, Bujumbura Rural province.
 On November 3, soldiers reportedly killed 200 persons in Mutambu, Bujumbura
 Rural province. Military authorities arrested three military unit leaders, who re-
 mainedin prison at year's end. According to an international observer, no one was
 formally charged.
 On December 11, soldiers reportedly killed 15 persons in the Mubone section of
 Kabezi commune, Bujumbura Rural province.
 Burundian citizens were involved in military actions on both sides of the armed
 conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo during the year.
 The Government still has not identified or brought to justice the persons respon-
 sible for the June 1996 killing in Cibitoke province of three expatriate employees
 of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The three persons accusedof the
 1995 killings of Italian religious workers still have not been brought to justice.
 According to an international human rights organization, as of the end of October,
 the criminal courts had initiated trials of several hundred defendants in cases relat-
 ed to the 1993 ethnic massacres that followed the killing of former president
 Ndadaye. Foreign lawyers provided under United Nations' auspices helped defend
 some of the accused. The courts handed down 290 sentences in these trials. Of
 these, 55 persons were sentenced to death; 175 others were given prison sentences;
 60 were acquitted. No death sentences were carried out during the year. Many other
 persons remained in detention for these massacres (see Section 1.d.). According to
 Amnesty International, more than 260 persons have been convicted and sentenced
 to death since February 1996. The six executions that were carried out in 1997 were
 the first civilian executions since 1982.
 On January 1, following an attack on Bujumbura airport, various sources reported
 that over 200 civilians were killed in the nearby village of Rukaramu, Bujumbura
 Rural province. The available evidence indicates that although the army was re-
 sponsible for some of the deaths, rebels killed most of the civilians.
 On January 7, according to an international human rights organization, rebels
 massacred 45 civilians in the commune of Mabayi, Cibitoke province.
 On February 10, according to an international human rights organization, rebels
 attacked the Minago section of Rumonge commune, Bururi province. They killed 32
 civilians, and wounded 20 others. The majority of the victims were women and chil-
 dren.
 Hutu rebels killed Hutu civilians for refusing to pay "taxes" to the rebels.
 On April 22, according to the national news service, rebels killed 26 civilians in
 Isale and Mugongomanga communes, Bujumbura rural province.
 On August 13, rebels reportedly killed seven persons in Mutambu commune,
 Bujumbura rural province.
 On September 2, rebels reportedly killed 17 persons and wounded 17 others in
 Murata commune, Kayanza province.
 On October 27, rebels killed 26 persons and wounded 25 others in Kanyosha com-
 mune, Bujumbura Rural province.
 On December 2, rebels killed 60 internally displaced persons and wounded 31 oth-
 ers at a camp in Gihanga commune, Bubanza province (see Section 2.d.).
 According to an international observer, the number of land mine incidents de-
 clined. There were 16 confirmed land mine incidents during the year, compared with
 47 such incidents in 1997.
 b. Disappearance.-Human rights groups reported that abductions and disappear-
 ances were common, and took place throughout the year. Disappearances were the
 result of both ethnic and political rivalries. Reliable numerical estimates are not
 available.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Transitional Constitutional Act prohibits these abuses; however, members of
 the security forces continued to torture and otherwise abuse persons.
 
 
 According to an international human rights organization, the rape of civilians by
 members of the security forces is common in and near internally displaced persons
 camps, which are located in close proximity to security forces' bases. There were no
 known prosecutions of members of the security forces for these abuses, according to
 the organization.
 There were numerous reports of rapes of civilians by rebels.
 Conditions in state-run prisons were life threatening and characterized by severe
 overcrowding and inadequate hygiene, clothing, medical care, food, and water. A
 total of about 10,000 inmates are housed in facilities built to accommodate a maxi-
 mum of 3,600 persons. Prisoners must rely on family members to provide an ade-
 quate diet, and officials acknowledged that digestive illness was a significant prob-
 lem among the prisoners. Diseases such as dysentery and malaria reached epidemic
 levels in some prisons. Deaths of prisoners from disease and malnutrition increased
 approximately 10 percent over the previous year's level, according to an inter-
 national observer. Female prisoners sometimes were housed in the same cells as
 male prisoners.
 United Nations human rights monitors were permitted to visit prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest and
 detention; however, security forces arbitrarily arrested and detained persons. The
 law places no limit on the length of pretrial detention. Presiding magistrates are
 authorized to issue arrest warrants. Police and gendarmes can make arrests without
 a warrant but must submit a written report to a magistrate within 48 hours of any
 arrest. A magistrate can order the suspect released or confirm the charges and con-
 tinue detention, initially for 15 days, then subsequently for periods of 30 days as
 necessary to prepare the case for trial.
 The law requires arrest warrants. The police must follow the same procedures as
 magistrates, but have detained suspects for extended periods without announcing
 charges, certifying the cases, or forwarding them to the Ministry of Justice as re-
 quired. There were numerous instances of arbitrary arrest. Bal was permitted in
 some cases. According to a human rights organization, incommunicado detention ex-
 ists although the law prohibits it.
 The disruption of the political process and the general level of insecurity severely
 impeded the judicial process. According to an international human rights organiza-
 tion, there are almost 10,000 pretrial detainees; they constitute 84 percent of the
 prison population.
 Former president and Parena party leader Jean Baptiste Bagaza was freed from
 house arrest in early March after the military court that tried him decided that it
 lacked jurisdiction in the case. Bagaza was placed under house arrest in March 1997
 for plotting to kill President Buyoya and possession of illegal weapons. The military
 court referred Bagaza's case to the Supreme Court. On October 1, the Supreme
 Court ruled that the military court did have jurisdiction. The military court has not
 taken action in response to the Supreme Court's ruling. Bagaza departed the coun-
 try voluntarily in April and has not returned.
 An international human rights organization estimates that the authorities hold
 from 500 to 1,000 political detainees.
 The law prohibits exile, and the Government has not used forced exile as a means
 of political control. However, many persons are in voluntary exile in Belgium,
 Kenya, Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and other countries. Many sen-
 ior officials keep their families outside the country. A number of officials of the gov-
 ernment of deposed president Sylvestre Ntibantanganya fled the country in 1996
 and have not returned.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Transitional Constitutional Act provides for
 an independent judiciary, but in practice the judiciary is not independent and is
 dominated by Tutsis. According to an international human rights organization,
 Hutus accounted for only 5 percent of the country's 638 judges. Most citizens as-
 sume that the courts promote the interests of the dominant Tutsi minority; mem-
 bers of the Hutu majority believe that the judicial system is biased against them.
 The judicial system is divided into civil and criminal courts with the Supreme
 Court at the apex. The military forces have a separate judicial system.
 Citizens generally did not have access to civilian and military court proceedings.
 Defendants are in theory presumed innocent and have the right to appeal. While
 defendants have a right to counsel and to defend themselves, few have legal rep-
 resentation in practice. The civil court system functioned, although the lack of a
 well-trained and adequately supported judiciary constrained expeditious proceed-
 ings. Besides the frequent lack of counsel for the accused, other major shortcomings
 in the legal system include a lack of adequate funding and trained personnel and
 an outmoded legal code. Many citizens have lost confidence in the system's ability
 
 
 to provide even basic protection. The vast majority of those arrested on criminal
 charges since October 1993 remain in custody awaiting trial.
 There are some clearly identifiable political prisoners, according to an inter-
 national human rights organization. Charges brought against defendants in non-
 political crimes are sometimes politically motivated.
 On October 2, the Supreme Court began deliberations in the trial of 79 persons
 accused of participation in the October 1993 coup and k ng of former president
 Ndadaye. Among the accused are several senior past and present members of the
 military forces. Serious judgment of these defendants appears remote.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Transitional Constitutional Act provides for the right to privacy, but according to
 reports, the authorities generally do not respect the law requiring search warrants.
 Security forces are assumed to monitor telephones regularly.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-There are no restrictions imposed on the press
 by the Transitional Constitutional Act; however, the regime owns the only news-
 paper and the two major radio stations._
 The government-owned Le Renouveau, which is published 3 times per week, is the
 only newspaper that appears regularly. Other newspapers, including at least one op-
 position newspaper, appear irregularly. Newspaper readership remains limited; lit-
 eracy is about 50 percent. Political tracts and news sheets continue to circulate.
 These represent a variety of political viewpoints, sometimes of an extremist nature.
 On March 25, security forces confiscated copies of L'Aube de a Democratie, a
 monthly newspaper that supports the Tutsis. On March 27, these forces closed the
 NetPress, an independent news service that had printed an account of the confisca-
 tion. Both resumed publication in November.
 The number of newspapers remained at about its 1997 level.
 There were a number of instances in which security forces harassed foreign jour-
 nalists.
 Many citizens listen to the two government-owned radio stations for information.
 One station broadcasts in the Kirundi language, the other in French and Swahili,
 with limited programming in English. There is one independent radio station, Radio
 tmwizero, which is financed by the European Union. It broadcasts in French and
 Kirndi. Citizens also receive the British Broadca ng Corporation, Voice of Amer-
 ica, and other international broadcasts. In addition, Radio France International
 began broadcasting on the F.M. band from Bujumbura in August. According to an
 internan  tinlse e       ntine radio station operated by Burundian Hutu
 rebels broadcast briefly fron the Democratic Republic of Congo early in the year.
 No laws or regulations limit academic freedom. Although no persons at the Uni-
 versity of Burundi were persecuted for what they published or said, the University,
 which is Burundi's only institution of higher learning, remains primarily a
 monoethnic Tutsi institution.  bA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government restricts free-
 dom of assembly. The Transitional Constitutional Act permits political demonstra-
 tions; however, the Government enforced a ban on all demonstrations.
 The Government restricts freedom of association. In March the Government ar-
 rested members of the Parena political party; in April and in July, it arrested mem-
 bers of the Uprona party. The Transitional Constitutional Act permits political par-
 ties to operate; however, the Government places restrictions on them, particularly
 on those that oppose government policies.                       -'
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Transitional Constitutional Act provides for freedom
 of religion, and the Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within thie Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Transitional Constitutional Act provides for these rights; however,
 the Government has in some instances restricted citizens' foreign travel for political
 reasons. The Government states that the restrictions are for legal, not political, rea-
 sons.
 In March the Government announced that the legal proceedings against National
 Assembly speaker Leonce Ngendakumana had been dropped for lack of evidence.
 Since that time, the Speaker has traveled abroad. Since 1996 the Government had
 prevented the Speaker from leaving the country because he was under investigation
 for alleged involvement in the ethnic massacres following the 1993 coup attempt.
 Despite the economic embargo imposed by neighboring countries, citizens contin-
 ued to be able to travel in and out of the country.
 Travel is possible in many parts of the country. However, armed rebel activity,
 particularly in parts of Bubanza, Bujumbura Rural, Bururi, Cibitoke, and Makamba
 provinces, makes travel perilous.
 
 
 The remaining forced regroupment camps were closed by the Government, accord-
 ing to international observers. However, over 550,000 citizens, or 9 percent of the
 population, have been displaced, some for as long as 6 years. For those in the camps
 for internally displaced persons, some farming is possible, although only with the
 permission of the military authorities. Serious ealth, water, and malnutrition prob-
 lems exist in many camps. Persons in the hills without a camp pass are considered
 to be rebels and were killed or wounded by government soldiers, according to a
 number of sources.
 Hutu rebels sometimes kill Hutus who remain outside the camps, according to an
 international human rights organization.
 According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), during the first
 9 months of the year, about 11,000 refugees were repatriated to Rwanda, Tanzania,
 and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In addition, according to the UNHCR, about
 300,000 Burundian refugees, most of them Hutu, remain in Angola, Cameroon, the
 Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tan-
 zania, and Zambia. Some of these persons fled as early as 1972, and many fled fol-
 lowing the killing of former president Ndadaye in 1993. Some fled the country dur-
 ing the year, but the UNHCR is unable to estimate their number.
 Repatriates have been the victims of abuses by the- Government and the rebels.
 According to the UNHCR, because of the ongoing civil war there are over 550,000
 internally displaced persons in 15 of the country's 16 provinces. Although the sol-
 diers assigned to guard duty in these camps provide a measure of protection to
 camp inhabitants, they sometimes commit human rights abuses against them. Rape
 of civilians by members of the security forces in and near internally displaced per-
 sons' camps reportedly is common (see Section 1.c.). On December 2, rebels killed
 60 internally displaced persons and wounded 31 others at a camp in Gihanga com-
 mune, Bubanza province (see Section l.a.).
 Camp inhabitants often are required to perform labor for soldiers without com-
 pensation (see Section 6.c.).
 On some occasions, the Government also has persecuted displaced persons. How-
 ever, it permits humanitarian assistance to reach displaced persons and promotes
 their return and resettlement. On occasion it compelled displaced persons to return
 to dangerous conditions.
 The law include provisions for granting refugee 'or asylee status in accordance
 with provisions of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its
 1967 Protocol.
 The Government has approved first asylum in recent years. However, on October
 24, the Government refused first asylum to five persons from the Democratic Repub-
 lic of Congo and returned them to their country, where they feared persecution.
 According to the UNHCR, there are approximately 20,000 citizens of the Demo-
 cratic Republic of Congo living in Burundi, many of whom claim asylum. Following
 the outbreak of fighting in that country in August, an additional 5,000 Congolese
 refugees and 2,500 Burundian repatriates entered Burundi.
 Rwandans who fled the 1994 ethnic massacres in Rwanda and were registered of-
 ficially as refugees in Burundi by the UNHCR all departed by 1997; no Rwandan
 refugees registered with the UNHCR remain. Those refugees who migrated earlier,
 some as early as 1959, number about 200,000 persons and are not registered offi-
 cially with the UNHCR. These refugees largely have been integrated into Burun-
 dian society.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government. The Transitional Con-
 stitutional Act makes no provision for elections. The 1992 Constitution and 1994
 Convention of Government both were suspended by the Buyoya military regime that
 assumed power on July 25, 1996 in a bloodless coup. On that date, the regime dis-
 solved the National Assembly and banned political parties. In 1996 Buyoya an-
 nounced the restoration of the National Assembly and political parties with certain
 restrictions.
 The National Assembly is dominated by the FRODEBU opposition party.
 On June 4, following a multiparty conference in Arusha, Tanzania, the National
 Assembly and the Government entered into a partnership agreement. The National
 Assembly adopted the Transitional Constitutional Act and a Transitional Political
 Platform. The Act changed the structure of government by eliminating the position
 of prime minister, creating two vice presidents, one Tutsi and one Hutu, removing
 the National Assembly speaker from the line of presidential succession, and enlarg-
 ing the National Assembly. The Act places no time limits on the terms of office of
 
 
 the president or the members of the National Assembly, although both are described
 as in transition for a 3-year period.
 The Transitional Political Platform endorses in general terms the restoration of
 democracy and correction of the ethnic imbalances in the army and the judicial sys-
 tem. It also calls for the creation of an international tribunal to try crimes of geno-
 cide.
 On June 12, a new Government was announced in which the First Vice President
 and 10 of the 22 cabinet ministers are Hutu members of the FRODEBU party. Al-
 though the new Cabinet strikes an overall ethnic balance, members of the Tutsi eth-
 nic group hold the key Ministries of Defense, Interior, Justice, and Finance.
 Under the 1992 constitution, deposed president Ntibantunganya was to have re-
 mained in office until 1998, when legislative elections had been scheduled. The last
 elections to fill the Assembly were held in June 1993. The Transitional Constitu-
 tional Act stipulates that the National Assembly consists of parliamentarians elect-
 ed in 1993 who sat in the previous National Assembly, plus 40 new members-28
 members of civil society appointed by the President and one representative each (se-
 lected by their respective parties) from all 12 officially recognized political parties
 not represented previously in the Assembly.
 Since not all those elected in 1993 still are alive or remain in the country, the
 vacant seats were filled by substitutes from the same political party as the original
 parliamentarian. Many of the 40 new seats were filled by Tutsi supporters of the
 Government.
 The Act also gives the President the authority to declare a state of emergency by
 decree after consulting with the President of the National Assembly, the National
 Security Council, and the Constitutional Court.
 There are no legal restrictions on the participation of women or indigenous people
 in elections or politics. In practice, however, both women and the ethnic Twa (Pyg-
 mies) are underrepresentd in government and in politics. Women hold I of 22 cabi-
 net seats (in the previous government women held 2 of the 24 cabinet seats) and
 in 1993 were elected to 9 of 81 seats in the National Assembly. However, one of
 the nine women later was killed.
 The expansion of the National Assembly and the filling of vacant seats raised the
 total number of female Parliamentarians to 16. One of the nine members of the Su-
 preme Court and three of the seven members of the Constitutional Court are
 women. Although Twa constitute about 1 percent of the po ulation, there are no
 Twa in the Cabinet; however, one Twa was appointed to the National Assembly dur-
 ing the year (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human rights groups received varying degrees of cooperation from govern-
 ment ministries; however, local military authorities restricted access to some areas.
 Iteka continued to operate and publish a newsletter on the human rights situation.
 Amnesty International and the U.N. Special Rapporteur for Human Rights for
 Burundi visited during the year. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights
 has an office in Burundi; however, the work of human rights organizations was
 hampered by insecurity in the countryside.
 Citing security concerns, local military authorities refused access to some areas
 of the interior to journalists, human rights workers, and international relief officials.
 Militant extremists threatened the lives of those investigating human rights viola-
 tions.
 The Transitional Constitutional Act adopted in June calls for an international
 commission of inquiry to identify large-scale crimes ("crimes massifs") committed in
 the country since independence and an international criminal tribunal to judge
 those persons accused of genocide (see Section 3).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Transitional Constitutional Act explicitly provides for equal status and pro-
 tection for all citizens, without distinction based on sex, origin, ethnicity, religion,
 or political opinion. However, the Government failed to enforce effectively all the
 Aces provisions. Hutus continue to perceive, correctly, that there is discrimination
 against them by the-Tutsi-dominated Government.
 Women.-Violence against women occurred, but there is no documentation of its
 extent. Wives have the right to bring physical abuse charges against their hus-
 bands; in practice, they do so only rarely. Police normally do not intervene in domes-
 tic disputes, and the media rarely report incidents of violence against women, in-
 cluding rape. There were no known court cases dealing with the abuse of women.
 
 
 Women face both legal and societal discrimination. There continue to be explicitly
 discriminatory inheritance laws and discriminatory credit practices. Although by
 law women must receive the same pay as men for the same work, women are far
 less likely to hold mid-level or high-level positions. In rural areas, women tradition-
 ally perform hard farm work, marry and have children at an early age, and have
 less opportunity for education than men.
 Children.-The lawprovides for children's health and welfare, but the Govern-
 ment cannot address the needs of children adequately. In particular it cannot care
 for the large population of orphans resuting in part from the violence since 1993.
 Many of the victims of massacres were children. The Government provides elemen-
 tary education at nominal cost through grade 6; about 60 percent of school-age chil-
 dren are enrolled. It also provides subsidized health care for all family members.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government has not enacted legislation or other-
 wise mandated access to buildings or government services for persons with disabil-
 ities. The rudimentary economy effectively excludes the physically disabled from
 many types of employment.
 Indigenous People.-The Twa (Pygmy) minority remains marginalized economi-
 cally, socially, and politically. Most Twa continued to live in isolation, uneducated,
 and without access to government services, including health care. In general the
 Twa remain outside the political process.
 NationallRaciallEthnic Minorities.-The principal national problem continued to
 be ethnic conflict between the majority Hutus and the minority Tutsis. The Tutsis
 historically have held power and still control the military forces; they dominate edu-
 cated society. The 1996 coup deposed president Ntibantunganya, a Hutu, and re-
 placed him with Major Buyoya, a Tutsi.
 Ethnic discrimination against Hutus, who constitute an estimated 85 percent of
 the population, affects every facet of society, but most strikingly higher education
 and certain branches of the Government such as the armed services and the judicial
 system. The President and the Tutsi-dominated army retain their dominance in de-
 cision-making and have not initiated genuine power sharing.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Labor Code nominally protects the rights of
 workers to form unions, although the army, gendarmerie, and expatriates working
 in the public sector are prohibited from union participation. Most union workers are
 urban civil servants.
 According to the Confederation of Free Unions of Burundi (CSB), an umbrella
 trade union, 60 percent of the 80,000 formal private sector employees are unionized.
 All employees in the public sector except those involved in activities related to pub-
 lic security are unionized.
 Since gaining its independence from the Government in 1992, the CSB, has de-
 pended financially on a system of checkoffs, as have local unions. In 1995.'a rival
 umbrella trade union, the Confederation of Burundi Unions (COSEBU), was found-
 ed. COSEBU and the CSB represented labor in collective bargaining negotiations
 in cooperation with individual labor unions during the year.
 Unions are Tutsi-dominated, reflecting the fact that it is Tutsis who dominate the
 formal sector of the economy. The unions also have been strong supporters of the
 Government.
 The Labor Code permits the formation of additional unions or confederations out-
 side the CSB. When settling disputes in which more than one labor union is rep-
 resented, the law stipulates that the Minister of Labor must choose the union rep-
 resenting the greatest number of workers to participate in the negotiations.
 The Labor Code provides workers with a restricted right to strike. The restrictions
 on the right to strike and to lock out include: All other peaceful means of resolution
 must be exhausted prior to the strike action; negotiations must continue during the
 action, mediated by a mutually agreed upon party or by the Government; and 6
 days' notice must be given. The law prohibits retribution against workers who par-
 ticipate in a legal strike, and this provision is upheld in practice.
 Unions are able to affiliate with international organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code recognizes
 the right to collective bargaining, formerly acknowledged only by ordinance. Since
 most workers are civil servants, government entities are involved in almost every
 phase of labor negotiations.
 Public sector wages are set in fixed scales in individual contracts and are not af-
 fected by collective bargaining. In the private sector, wage scales also exist, but indi-
 vidual contract negotiation is possible.
 The Labor Code gives the Labor Court jurisdiction over all labor dispute cases,
 including those involving public employees. Negotiations are conducted largely

 under the supervision of the tripartite National Labor Council, the Government's
 highest consultative authority on labor matters. The Council represents government,
 labor, and management and is presided over and regulated by the Minister of Labor.
 The Labor Code prohibits employers from firing or otherwise discriminating
 against a worker because of union affiliation, or activity. This right is upheld in
 practice.
 There are no functioning export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits the performance
 of forced or compulsory labor by adults and children. Forced labor takes place in
 internally displaced persons' camps, but it is not known to occur elsewhere. The sol-
 diers guarding internally displaced persons camps ofen require camp inhabitants
 to cook,fetch water, chop wood, and perform other chores witout compensation.
 Rebel soldiers also require peasants to perform uncompensated labor.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The
 Labor Code states that children under the age of 16 cannot be employed by "an en-
 terprise" even as apprentices, although it also states that they may undertake occa-
 sional work that does not damage their health or interfere with their schooling. In
 practice, in rural areas children under age 16 do heavy manual labor such as trans-
 porting bricks in daytime during the school year.
 The minimum age for military service is 18 years, but -there are some child sol-
 diers in the army.
 Children are prohibited by law from working at night, although many do so in
 the informal sector. Children are obliged by customx and economic necessity to help
 support their families by participating in activities related to subsistence agri-
 culture, in family-based enterprises, and in the informal sector. The law prohibits
 forced and bonded labor by children, and the Government enforces this prohibition
 effectively (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The formal minimum wage for unskilled work-
 ers is $0.40 (145 francs) per day in the cities of Bujumbura and Gitega and $0.35
 (120 francs) in the rest of the country,' with a graduated scale for greater skill levels.
 This amount does not allow a worker and family to maintain a decent standard of
 living, and most families rely on second incomes and subsistence agriculture to sup-
 plement their earnings. A 1997 survey of day-labor wage rates in nine provinces by
 an international organization revealed that actual wages ranged upward from $0.30
 (109 francs) per day.
 Unionized employees, particularly in urban areas, generally earn significantly
 more than the minimum wage. Public sector wages are set by agreement between
 the Government and either the CSB or COSEBU. Foreign workers are protected by
 law and are not subject to discrimination.
 The Labor Code stipulates an 8-hour workday and a 40-hour workweek, except
 in cases where workers are involved in activities related to national security. Sup-
 plements must be paid for overtime. The Labor Code establishes health and safety
 standards, requires an employer to rovide a safe workplace, and assigns enforce-
 ment responsibility to the Minister oL abor. However, the Ministry does not enforce
 the code effectively. Health and safety articles in the Labor Code do not address di-
 rectly workers' rights to remove themselves from a dangerous work situation.
