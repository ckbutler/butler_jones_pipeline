 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 Since independence in October 1979, St. Vincent and the
 Grenadines has retained the parliamentary system of government
 it inherited from the United Kingdom. Democratic institutions
 and respect for the rights of the individual are well
 established. After defeating the incumbent St. Vincent Labor
 Party in 1984 elections, James F. Mitchell and his New
 Democratic Party won all 15 seats in the Parliament in general
 elections held in May 1989. Although some concern was voiced
 about the absence of any parliamentary opposition, the
 elections were judged to be free and fair.
 The Royal St. Vincent Police is the only security force in the
 country. The Coast Guard serves under Police command, and a
 small Special Service Unit (SSU) with some pa;amilitary
 training has been established within the police force. The
 force, which is controlled by and responsive to the civilian
 government, maintains traditions of professionalism which
 place a high value on respect for human rights.
 One of the poorer countries in the region, St. Vincent has a
 very young population, a relatively high rate of illiteracy,
 and serious unemployment problems. After several major
 setbacks in recent years (primarily due to poor weather), the
 nation's economy, centered on the vital banana industry, has
 largely recovered. Banana exports boomed during 1988 and the
 first half' of 1989, but diversification to other export crops
 had only limited progress.
 The country's human rights record remained good in 1989.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial
 killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment are prohibited by the Constitution,
 and there were no reports of such practices.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 According to the Constitution, persons detained for criminal
 offenses iust be provided legal representation and have their
 cases reviewed periodically. The Government strictly adheres
 to these provisions.
 With regard to forced or complusory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for public trials before an
 independent and impartial court. Criminal defendants are
 
 
 733
 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 entitled to select their own legal counsel; alternately,
 counsel may be provided by the court. Defendants are presumed
 innocent until proven guilty and can appeal cases to a
 regional high court system and ultimately to the Privy Council
 in London.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no reports of arbitrary search and seizure or other
 government intrusions into the private life of individual
 citizens in 1989. The Constitution prohibits such actions.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the
 press. The Government does not censor or otherwise interfere
 with the operation of the press. There are two major
 newspapers and numerous smaller, partisan publications; all
 are privately owned, and most are openly critical of the
 Government's policies. In 1988 the government-owned radio
 station canceled a program which the Government considered
 provocative; however, the station, with the Government's
 approval, agreed to reinstate the program late in 1989.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are provided for in the Constitution and
 respected in practice.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 All religions are free to practice and proselytize.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 These rights are provided for by law and honored in practice.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Notwithstanding the New Democratic Party's clean sweep of all
 15 parliamentary seats in the May 1989 elections, St. Vincent
 still has a genuine multiparty political system, with at least
 four active parties. Although the "first past the post"
 system tends to mask the degree of support for various
 contenders, in the last election the opposition garnered over
 30 per cent of the vote. Constitutionally, elections must be
 held at least every 5 years, by secret ballot, with universal
 suffrage.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Opposition political groups and the Vincentian press
 occasionally comment on human rights matters of local
 concern. The Government is responsive to public and private
 inquiries on its human rights practices. Until late 1989, the
 
 
 734
 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 small Caribbe.an-wide human rights monitoring group CARICARE
 was based in St. Vincent. However, the brganization moved to
 Trinidad for better access to transportation and communication
 facilities.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under law
 regardless of race, sex, or religion, and the Government
 adheres to this provision. This year the Government took a
 significant step forward in terms of wage scales for women,
 adopting for the first time in a new minimum wage law the
 concept of equal pay for equal work.
 Violence against women occurs in St. Vincent but does not
 appear to be characteristic of Vincentian society, according
 to such sources as the director of St. Vincent's National
 Council of Women, several government officials, and local
 lawyers who handle such cases. The Vincentian newspaper also
 reports all court cases and known incidents of violence.
 Penalties for violent crimes against women are identical to
 acts of assault perpetrated against men. For rape, depending
 on the magnitude of the offence and the age of the victim, the
 penalty is generally 10 or more years in prison. However, the
 House of Assembly in 1989 was considering legislation
 specifically addressing penalties for violent acts against
 women. During the year, there were two convictions for rape,
 as well as several others for assault against women. Although
 some victims of such violence, especially domestic violence
 such as wife beating, are reluctant to report it or to press
 charges, in the past few years women have been increasingly
 willing to report such incidents to the police and the
 National Council of Women. The Governhent's Ministry of
 Education, Youth, and Women has a Women's Desk which assists
 the National Council of Women with seminars, training
 programs, and public relations. The Government provides some
 funding for the National Council of Women and has been
 supportive of radio call-in programs dealing with women's
 issues.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 By law, Vincentians have the right to form unions, organize
 employees and strike; laws of association are generally
 respected in practice. Unions are independent and personal
 and property rights of trade unionists are given full
 protection under the law. With the partial recognition of the
 St. Vincent union of teachers this year, the overall
 proportion of the unionized labor force has increased slightly
 from the approximately 15 percent level in 1988. Unions may
 form or join federations or'confederations. Unions are free
 to affiliate and do affiliate with international labor bodies,
 and both the Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade
 Unions and the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions have affiliates in St. Vincent.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There are no legal obstacles to organizing unions; however,
 employers are not legally bound to recognize a particular
 union as an exclusive bargaining agent. The law prohibits
 antiunion discrimination by employers against union members
 
 
 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 and organizers. Fairly effective mechanisms exist for
 resolving complaints. In 1989 the National Workers Movement
 achieved a recognition agreement with one foreign-owned firm
 after a brief strike and the personal intervention of the
 Prime Minister. At the same time the Public Service Union has
 not yet attained recognition because it still has not reached
 the necessary 50-percent membership of civil service
 employees. There are no sectors or areas, including export
 processing zones, where union organization and collective
 bargaining are legally or administratively discouraged or
 impeded.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is illegal in St. Vincent and does
 not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 By law 15 years is the minimum working age; this provision,
 which is monitored and enforced by the Ministry of Labor's
 Labor Inspection Office, is generally respected in practice.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The workweek is 40 hours in 5 days. Workers are guaranteed a
 minimum annual vacation of 2 weeks. Minimum wages, which are
 set by law for economic sectors, were raised substantially in
 1989. The main impact has been in the small manufacturing
 sector, where daily rates almost doubled from $3.85 to $7.40.
 This was the first increase in the minimum wage since 1982.
 To date the impact on employment has been slight; several
 firms have reduced their work force, but only one company has
 closed due to the higher wage bill. Many minimum wages are
 not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for
 workers and their families, but most workers earn more than
 the minimum. Informal arrangements covering occupational
 safety and health do exist, but the Government has made little
 progress in converting these into law.
