 NAMIBIA
 Namibia is a former Germany colony occupied and administered
 by the Republic of South Africa since 1915, with a League of
 Nations mandate from 1920-1966. Today, South Africa illegally
 administers Namibia through an appointed Administrator General
 who exercises executive power. He has the authority to issue
 proclamations with the force of law. Under the Administrator,
 or "first-tier" central government level, there are:
 'second-tier" authorities--separate ethnic governing bodies
 representing each of the 10 officially designated population.
 groups except the Bushmen--who exercise semiautonomous
 authority in areas determined by the Administrator General;
 and *third-tier" authorities, such as municipal governments
 and village management boards, who are limited to providing
 local services. Not all the ethnic authorities have equal
 power, and under this three-tier system, whites receive a
 disproportionate share of resources. Official commissions
 have criticized this three-tier structure for corruption and
 inefficiency.
 Just over a million persons live in Namibia, more than half of
 them in two provinces along the northern border with Angola:
 Ovamboland and Kavango. The Ovambo ethnic group comprises 47
 percent of Namibia's population. Even so, the old colonial
 boundaries divide the Ovambo. Almost a third of them live in
 southern Angola. Namibia's northeastern corner receives
 plentiful rainfall, but during only one season. Elsewhere,
 the country is generally arid; the Namib desert covers the
 southwestern region and the entire western coast.
 The judiciary in Namibia consists of two overlapping systems:
 one for whites, 'westernized" blacks, and persons of mixed
 race; the other for indigenous Africans. Wide-ranging
 security legislation largely parallels that enacted in South
 Africa.
 The denial of the right to exercise self-rule in Namibia
 continues. In 1966, the United Nations revoked South Africa's
 mandate over Namibia, originally granted by the League of
 Nations in the aftermath of World War I. However, South
 Africa has refused to relinquish its jurisdiction, even after
 the International Court of Justice in 1971 upheld U.N.
 authority over Namibia, determined that South Africa's
 presence there was illegal, and stated that South Africa was
 obligated to withdraw its administration from Namibia
 immediately.
 In 1978, the five Western nations of the United Nations
 Security Council worked out a proposal for Namibian
 independence with South Africa, neighboring states, and
 SWAPO--the South West Africa People's Organization--which has
 been fighting a guerrilla war with South Africa since 1966.
 The proposal was presented and approved as United Nations
 Security Council Resolution 435. It calls for the cessation
 of all hostilities, free elections under the supervision of
 the United Nations, and the phased withdrawal of South African
 armed forces.
 Negotiations since 1978 have focused on issues connected with
 the implementation of the U.N. Plan, e.g., agreement in 1981
 on assurances regarding U.N. impartiality in supervising
 elections in Namibia. Since 1983, the principal issue has
 been the position of South Africa that it will not agree to
 implement the U.N. independence plan for Namibia until it has
 
 
 311
 NAMIBIA
 a satisfactory commitment on the withdrawal of Cuban troops
 from neighboring Angola. In November 1984, the Angolan
 Government made a formal proposal on Cuban troop withdrawal
 within the context of an overall regional settlement,
 including the implementation of Resolution 435 on Namibian
 independence. South Africa has responded with proposals of
 its own. The U.S. has been playing a mediating role in order
 to facilitate an agreement resulting in the implementation of
 Resolution 435.
 Meanwhile Namibia continues to experience low-level guerrilla
 conflict with insurgents of SWAPO's military branch, the
 People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), fighting the South
 African Defense Forces (SADF) and the South West Africa
 Territorial Force (SWATF). SWAPO draws its strength
 principally from within the Ovambo people. The bulk of the
 insurgency and counter-insurgency effort occurs in Ovamboland
 and Kavango, but sporadic violence erupts throughout the
 country.
 Namibia's economy relies principally on mining, farming, and
 fishing. Tourism is an emerging revenue-earner. The white
 minority controls each of these sectors, with the exception of
 traditional agriculture, and much of the revenue generated has
 made its way back to the Republic of South Africa in the form
 of corporate profits and stockholder dividends. However, the
 South African Government has viewed Namibia as a major drain
 on its budget.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Charges that South African police and security forces commit
 murder continue to be made by lawyers, journalists, and
 political figures, as well as SWAPO. A leader of the Namibian
 Christian Democratic Party called a news conference in late
 August and named five residents who, he said, had been killed
 by SADF/SWATF forces in Kavango. A number of clergymen,
 journalists, and the Bar Council of South-West Africa have
 also made accusations of murder against Koevoet, the special
 South African police unit assigned to track SWAPO in the
 northern operational area. South African authorities say that
 they investigate each allegation and prosecute offenders if
 the necessary evidence exists. Some witnesses are, however,
 reportedly reluctant to come forward, for fear of retaliation
 by security forces.
 The SADF blamed SWAPO forces for 28 murders between January
 and June 1984. SADF records cite the dates, times, and
 locations of each incident. A spokesman for the SADF said
 that such incidents had greatly decreased in the past several
 years. According to its records, 91 civilians had been killed
 by land mine or assassinations in 1983, compared with over 100
 each in the years 1982 and 1981.
 In support of its contention that SWAPO has changed to a
 policy of indiscriminate mining of roads, government forces
 report that SWAPO land mines killed 33 civilians from
 January-August 1984. Black leaders recognize that mining is
 often indiscriminate but note that some people believe such
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 21
 
 
 312
 NAMIBIA
 casualties are an unfortunate but acceptable byproduct of
 etforts to hit defense force targets.
 The level of insurgent attacks on urban areas increased in the
 operational area during 1984. Mechanically detonated limpet
 mines and occasional mortar attacks on populated areas
 resulted in a number of deaths and injuries and considerable
 property damage. One small device exploded in Windhoek itself
 with little or no damage.
 b. Disappearance
 Disappearances continue to be a regular occurrence in
 Namibia. The Government habitually withholds information on
 individuals it detains under security legislation, making it
 difficult for families to locate missing relatives. This
 blurs the distinction between disappearances and detentions,
 at least temporarily.
 South African security forces figures list 34 civilians
 abducted by SWAPO in the first 10 months of 1984 and 278
 persons during all of 1983. The SADF claims that SWAPO relies
 on such abductions to provide recruits for its military wing,
 but that the organization is abandoning the practice because
 of concern for its domestic image. SWAPO maintains that its
 recruits join voluntarily.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 A number of internal Namibian political leaders, as well as
 some clergymen, report that security forces in the operational
 area, and Koevoet in particular, employ ruthless methods to
 extract information and discourage sympathy for SWAPO.
 Suspected SWAPO agents, it is said, undergo brutal treatment
 from their interrogators, and SWAPO guerrillas seem never to
 be brought to trial. They are either killed, interned under
 very harsh conditions, or join the security forces--usually
 Koevoet.
 Police and military insist they investigate all allegations
 but that victims are required to step forward and press
 charges. Critics respond that victims are too afraid to
 testify against elements they believe will exact retribution.
 Indeed, in a November 1983 court case, a police officer
 refused to testify against Koevoet, claiming that he feared he
 would be killed in retaliation.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Administrator General's proclamation AG-9 designates
 "security districts' in Namibia where authorities have the
 right to detain individuals indefinitely, and without
 explanation or trial, for renewable 30-day periods. This
 proclamation is reinforced by other security legislation, such
 as AG-26 which permits detention for indefinite periods.
 Security districts include Windhoek and certain areas to the
 nortn, among them Ovamboland and Kavango. This legislation is
 used relatively often and indiscriminately, and the Government
 often refuses to disclose even the names of those it has
 detained. On June 9, 1984, the Government took into custody
 37 leading members of SWAPO's internal organization who had
 gathered for a barbecue to celebrate the earlier release of 54
 detainees from an internment camp in Namibia. The move came
 
 
 313
 NAMIBIA
 during then Prime Minister P.W. Botha's European tour and was
 well publicized as a result. The 37 reportedly were held in
 solitary confinement for several days, in 5 different
 detention camps as much as 300 kilometers apart, before being
 released on their own recognizance. The Government later
 dropped all charges.
 A better known use of AG-9 involved the Keikanachab camp
 outside the city of Mariental, where until 1984 the Government
 held 146 prisoners, including 14 Angolans, most of whom had
 been captured in a raid on SWAPO bases near Cassinga, Angola,
 in 1978. In March, 3 prominent clergymen were among a group
 of applicants who brought suit against the authorities to
 obtain the release of 37 prisoners they had been able to
 identify. The Government was able to have the suit summarily
 dismissed, using a section of the South African Defense Act.
 But o. May 24, the Angolans and 55 of the other Mariental
 detainees were released. On October 11, the camp's only woman
 detainee was released, and on October 18, 74 of the known 75
 remaining prisoners were released in Ovamboland where they had
 been flown to undergo an orientation course on how society had
 changed since their internment. Military officials said the
 men no longer posed a threat to security. One man, Petrus
 Haimbodi, was not released, though he was transferred out of
 Keikanachab. The authorities described Haimbodi as a *trained
 SWAPO guerrilla" who still represented a security threat.
 Another unidentified man, one of the original detainees, is
 apparently not at Mariental but is unaccounted for.
 Other Namibians remain in detention, including Immanuel
 Moongo, who was detained under AG-9 on September 6, 1983, and
 Boas Mwendelili, reportedly detained on the same day. The
 Government declines to provide detailed information on him or
 other detainees, including their precise whereabouts. The
 Government repeatedly refused to allow attorneys access to the
 Mariental detainees.
 Some detainees are released and placed under restricted
 conditions, as under the South African Internal Security Act.
 Such restrictions can vary with each individual but usually
 prohibit meetings with more than four other individuals and
 entail strict curfew hours. Restricted persons must be home,
 alone, between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. There are no available
 statistics on the numbers of persons affected by this
 practice. A SWAPO Vice President, Nathaniel Maxwilili,
 remains under restriction in Walvis Bay. He received
 permission to attend the May 1984 meeting in Lusaka of SWAPO,
 the Administrator General, and parties in the Multi-Party
 Conference.
 According to the Department of Justice, 21 Namibians are still
 imprisoned in the Republic of South Africa on Robben Island,
 which is reserved for political prisoners. In April, the
 South African Government released Andimba (Herman) Toivo Ja
 Toivo, a cofounder of SWAPO, from Robben Island, where he had
 been imprisoned for 16 years. Following his release, he was
 reelected secretary general of the party. In June, the
 Government released 15 other Namibian prisoners from Robben
 Island. Almost all had been serving sentences of 8 to 20
 years after being found guilty of violations of the Terrorism
 Act.
 In September 1983, the Administrator General announced that a
 commission of inquiry would be established to make
 
 
 314
 NAMIBIA
 recommendations on the 'adequacy, fairness, and efficacy of
 legislation pertaining to the internal security of Namibia.,
 The Commission gathered evidence throughout the country in
 1984. Its sessions have been in camera, however, and it is
 not known when the Commission's final report will be released.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Those persons detained under AG-9 and other pieces of security
 legislation have no recourse to the courts. The South African.
 Government, as noted, effectively blocked a suit on behalf of
 37 Mariental AG-9 detainees by resorting to the Defense Act.
 That Act enables the authorities to quash any court action by
 issuing a certification barring continuation of the trial.
 Only two criteria are required: 1) it must be in the national
 interest to discontinue the proceeding; 2) the certificate
 must be issued in "good faith" for the purpose of prevention
 or suppression of terrorism in an operational area (i.e., area
 of insurgency).
 With this exception, persons brought to court can expect a
 hearing based on the legal merits of their case. They have
 access to effective counsel, and charges against them are
 clearly stated at the time of arraignment. All cases are
 tried in civilian courts since no state of war has been
 formally declared.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Politically active Namibians, including journalists,
 clergymen, and political figures, report that surveillance by
 the authorities is routine, whether of their mail, telephone
 lines, or casual conversations. AG-9 confers virtually
 unlimited powers of search and seizure on security forces in
 security zones. In the operational area, invasion of the home
 is said to be commonplace. Visiting clergymen report that
 their vehicles have been stopped and all occupants forced to
 undergo body searches. They say even religious pamphlets have
 been confiscated. Throughout Namibia, the provisions of
 security legislation take precedence over other legal
 requirements for warrants to search private homes.
 In a 1971 advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice
 found that South Africa's administration of Namibia *based on
 grounds of race, color, descent, or national or ethnic origin"
 was a 'denial of fundamental human rights' and *a flagrant
 violation of the purposes and principles of the United Nations
 charter."
 In 1977, the appointment of Judge T. Marthinus Steyn as
 Administrator General resulted in the easing of apartheid in
 Namibia. The Immorality and Mixed Marriages Acts were
 repealed, pass laws were abolished, and the restrictions on
 toe movement of labor were greatly relaxed. There is
 noticeably less segregation in most parts of Namibia than in
 South Africa. Still, de facto segregation endures. Some
 white toughs forcibly discourage non-white use of a swimming
 pool in a largely white residential area of Windhoek. A
 barber shop in downtown Windhoek discourages black clientele.
 Although restaurants and hotels are officially open to all
 races, the right of equal admission is often not enforced in
 less than deluxe establishments.
 
 
 315
 NAMIBIA
 Furthermore, in the areas of most direct importance to the
 majority of the population--schools and hospitals--services
 are still supplied by separate ethnic second-tier
 governments. The effect is that whites with a much higher tax
 base have access to first-rate hospitals and an underutilized
 teacher training college, while various black groups obtain
 distinctly inferior and overcrowded services. In addition,
 some facilities directly administered by the South African
 Government, such as the railroads, are still segregated.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 South Africa's stringent press laws extend to Namibia. They
 greatly restrict reporting on a wide variety of matters such
 as prisons, military affairs, detentions, energy, and security
 affairs. Opinion and editorial writing is less restricted,
 and even published comment that is favorable to SWAPO is
 tolerated. Within the legal parameters, the Namibian press
 has regularly embarrassed the Government with reports of
 malfeasance and corruption. One newspaper in particular, the
 Windhoek Observer, was renowned for its vigorous and
 independent reporting on human rights violations. The
 Government banned specific issues and, on August 15, a
 committee of the South African Directorate for Publications
 banned all future editions of the Observer, effectively
 closing it down. The committee's grounds were that the
 Observer had violated sections of the Publications Act making
 it unlawful to publish material which is "indecent or obscene
 or offensive to the public morals," or material which is
 "prejudicial to the safety of the state, the general welfare,
 or the peace or good order." Several weeks later, the South
 African Publications Appeal Board unbanned the newspaper, but
 warned its publishers that some of the newspaper's material
 was "on the verge of a contravention of the Publication Act.'
 The Observer has now adopted a more cautious editorial
 policy. Its outspoken political editor Gwen Lister was
 demoted and, after many of the staff quit in protest, she
 resigned. In December she was charged with violation of the
 Post Office Act and the Secrecy Act, when she showed members
 of the press a top secret letter from the police in Pretoria
 to the postmaster in Windhoek ordering surveillance of her
 mail. She had discovered the letter in her postal box. As of
 mid-December, her case had not yet come to trial.
 Since the Observer banning, the Government has raised the
 security deposit required of all newspaper publishers from
 $10,000 to $20,000. The deposit effectively discourages new
 newspapers from being launched and also tends to inhibit
 publishers from edging too close to the boundaries of Namibian
 journalism, for fear of forfeiting their deposits.
 All publications banned in South Africa are also banned in
 Namibia, and the possession of such literature is grounds for
 prosecution. A Namibian journalist appeared in a South
 African court in May 1984 under charges brought after South
 African airport police discovered that she was carrying
 publications which were on the banned list. She was
 subsequently acquitted May 7, using the defense that since so
 many publications were banned, it was not possible to know
 which ones could be legally held. The magistrate said
 prosecutors had not proven that she knowingly committed a
 crime.
 
 
 316
 NAMIBIA
 Although South Africa's censorship law extends to Namibian
 territory, its enforcement by the Namibian Attorney General is
 somewhat less stringent than in South Africa.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The 1981 "Prohibition and Notification of Meetings Act,"
 Administrator General Proclamation AG 170, places restrictions
 on political parties' meetings and requires political parties
 to abjure violence or the taking up of arms to effect
 political change. According to this law, meetings are not
 prevented in advance, but prosecutions can result from
 violations. The number of actual prosecutions is unknown.
 In addition, leaders of a breakaway faction of the Southwest
 Africa National Union (SWANU) complained that in late 1984
 tneir party members had been stopped and harassed by the
 security forces while en route to meetings. They report that
 their members were questioned about their support of one set
 of SWANU leaders over the leaders who advocate membership in
 the Multi-Party Congress, which has the support of the South
 African Government.
 Namibia's six labor unions are all registered and all
 nominally non-racial, although only the mine workers union has
 a sizable black membership. Only the mine workers union and
 the municipal workers union, which is basically for white-
 collar workers, can be considered functioning employee
 organizations. The mine workers union, however, is represented
 in only one of the three mining firms. As in South Africa,
 strikes in Namibia are legal, but the machinery for handling
 disputes is so cumbersome that it is never used. Strikes are,
 therefore, invariably of the wildcat variety. Black labor
 militancy is not evident. Most large-scale employers, even in
 the fishing industry, use migrant workers who live in
 compounds controlled by management. This arrangement,
 combined with the employers' extremely paternalistic attitude
 toward the workers, contributes to workers' relative passivity.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Namibians enjoy full freedom of religion. Most are
 Christians. Sects represented include Lutherans, Roman
 Catholics, Anglicans, and a number of other religious
 denominations.
 Many clergymen, however, complain that the authorities harass
 them, because the Government believes they favor SWAPO and
 because of their statements critical of the continued South
 African presence in Namibia. Clergymen report that, during
 visits into the operational area, their vehicles have been
 stopped, every occupant, including clergymen, searched, and
 printed materials of a purely religious nature confiscated.
 The Lutheran Church figures prominently in reports of
 harassment. The Church has charged that on August 2 an
 eyewitness observed members of the South African Defense Force
 (SADF) planting a land mine outside their mission hospital at
 Onipa in the operational area. The authorities say the police
 found a detonator buried on the hospital grounds, but they
 deny that the SADF had placed it there.
 Non-Namibian church groups opposed to South African occupation
 and administration visit regularly. The South African Council
 of Churches completed a fact-finding tour of Namibia in early
 
 
 317
 NAMIBIA
 October. In July, the South African Government initially
 refused to issue passports to three Namibian church officials
 who wished to attend the Lutheran World Assembly in Budapest,
 but ultimately granted a travel document to one. The military
 conscription system, fully activated in October, makes no
 provision for conscientious objectors.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Pass laws have been abolished in Namibia, so movement within
 the country is much freer than in South Africa. In the
 northern operational area, however, curfews and checkpoints
 severely restrict freedom of movement. In addition, the fear
 of land mines and SWAPO violence also restricts travel in this
 area. One journalist said he drives only after 10 a.m. and
 before 4 p.m., after the roads have been swept for mines and
 before the approaching twilight lends cover to guerrillas.
 No ethnic groups have been resettled in recent years. In
 November, the 900 members of the Riemvasmakers Community
 petitioned the Administrator General to be resettled in
 northern Namibia from their current home in Damaraland. The
 petition said their livestock had been killed off by drought
 and wild animals, and they were finding it increasingly
 difficult to find jobs. The Riemvasmakers fled from Namibia
 to the Cape Province at the turn of the century. They were
 resettled in Damaraland in 1974.
 In early June 1984, the paramount chief of the Herero ethnic
 group said progress had been made during talks with the
 Government on the possible resettlement of 30,000 Hereros
 living in Botswana. Chief Kuaima Riruako held talks in
 Windhoek with the Administrator General regarding these
 Hereros, many of whom trace their ancestry to Hereros forced
 out of South West Africa after the failed Herero uprising in
 1904-1905 against the German administration.
 In August, the press reported on government plans to convert
 into a nature conservation area some 6,000 square miles in
 which a part of the Bushman ethnic group, the Ju/Wasi,
 maintain a traditional way of life. Critics of the Government
 denounced the move as a harsh and unnecessary encroachment on
 the Ju/Wasi's traditional culture and economic existence.
 They noted that the Ju/Wasi had been deprived in 1970 of 70
 percent of their land, and that many have been forced to exist
 on the fringes of modern society, dependent upon handouts from
 the Government and on remittances from those relatives who
 have cash-paying jobs. The Government responded that the
 conservation area contains rare species and that the
 conversion of the area would provide jobs for the Bushmen,
 while still permitting them to use their own methods for
 gathering food. As of November, a final decision on the
 conservation area had not been made.
 Travel abroad is strictly controlled by government
 authorities. By law, all who leave South Africa or Namibia
 must have a passport or 'travel document.' The Government
 often declines to issue such documents to Namibians suspected
 of pro-SWAPO leanings, or who are officially associated with
 SWAPO. SWAPO leader Andimba Toivo Ja Toivo was issued an
 *open* passport, which enabled him to travel anywhere, after
 traveling frequently on a more restricted travel document.
 
 
 318
 NAMIBIA
 All persons entering South Africa or Namibia must have a
 passport and visa unless they can prove to be Namibian or
 South African by law or descent.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The right of citizens to change their Government is
 non-existent in Namibia. The Administrator General wields
 full executive power. Nevertheless, despite the application
 of security restrictions to control political activity as
 noted above, significant political activity continues. SWAPO
 has an internal wing that is cautiously active in Windhoek.
 There are some 44 political organizations in Namibia, several
 of which have only a handful of members. The organizations
 range from modern parties to traditional groups based on
 ethnicity. Two key groups--a breakaway faction of the
 Southwest Africa National Union (SWANU) and the Damara
 Council--have formed a political alliance with SWAPO, which
 they call the "Patriotic Front."
 The announcement this year that all Namibians would be
 required to enlist for military service, which could require
 that they fight to maintain South African rule, caused a
 widespread outcry. The status of the registration drive was
 unclear as of mid-December, after questions were raised about
 its legal basis. Some 14,000 men were already registered,
 many under threat of firing by their employers. There was no
 official announcement that registration would cease.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Critics of the human rights situation in Namibia make regular
 trips there. In October, a delegation of bishops from the
 South African Council of Churches made a fact-finding tour of
 Namibia, which included a visit to the northern area where
 insurgency and counterinsurgency actions are most active.
 Their report has yet to be issued, but there are indications
 that it will be critical of current South African policy. The
 closing of the Windhoek Observer, an important source of
 information on allegations of human rights violations, was
 widely attributed to its critical reporting on controversial
 issues, including human rights. Amnesty International in its
 1984 report (covering 1983) noted the detention without trial
 of political detainees and the allegations that some of them
 were tortured and ill-treated. In its 1984-85 Report, Freedom
 House rates Namibia *not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The population of Namibia is roughly 1.07 million: 7 percent
 white and 93 percent black. The population growth rate was 3
 percent in 1984. Life expectancy at birth is approximately 61
 years, and the infant mortality rate (1984) is 112.3 per 1.000
 live births. Calorie supply as a percentage of requirements
 was 95.75 percent in 1977, the most recent year for which data
 ate available. Literacy figures (1983) are 100 percent for
 whites and 28 percent for blacks, with school attendance 100
 percent for whites and 16 percent for blacks. In 1982, per
 capita gross national product was about $1,935, with
 distribution of income heavily skewed in favor of the white
 population.
 
 
 319
 NAMIBIA
 Western culture predominates among Africans living in urban
 areas and among the many migratory workers. But in the more
 isolated rural areas traditional society remains relatively
 intact. Many of the differences in the quality of life are
 due to the administration of important government services,
 particularly health and education, by the ethnically based
 second-tier governments. This inefficient system of
 government perpetuates qualitative and quantitative
 differences in government resources and services provided to
 white and black Namibians.
 Namibia enjoys a sophisticated and extensive physical
 infrastructure. A modern economy, in which most whites
 participate and which produces most of the wealth, co-exists
 with a traditional, subsistence, agriculturally based economy,
 which supports most of the labor force. A large majority of
 the blacks are in the subsistence economy, although many
 blacks are employed in the modern sector, mainly at lower
 levels. Both sectors of Namibia's economy are based heavily
 on natural resources, i.e., fishing, mining, and farming,
 which were battered during 1984. Large sections of Namibia's
 waters are overfished by foreign fleets which operate
 unlicensed and unchecked. Mineral prices and revenue are
 depressed, and massive capital infusions are needed to
 overhaul the mining infrastructure. Namibians fear that their
 natural resources are being depleted by South African and
 other foreign firms. Profits from entrepreneurial ventures
 are transferred outside the country, whether in the form of
 stockholder dividends or direct corporate transfers. New
 investment is impeded due to uncertainty over Namibia's
 future. Many of the whites, who control the modern economy,
 including South African civil servants, have a limited
 commitment to Namibia's future. Most have assets and
 potential jobs outside the country--often in South
 Africa--which they can fall back on should circumstances
 require their leaving Namibia.
 An estimated 70 percent of the population rely on subsistence
 farming in the traditional sector, and another 10 percent on
 modern commercial farming. Both sectors have been affected by
 the current drought, which is considered the worst since World
 War II and has resulted in hunger in a number of areas,
 including Kaokoland in the northwest.
 South Africa has, according to government officials,
 guaranteed more than $90 million in loans in 1984 alone and
 provided more than $325 million annually in direct aid to
 Namibia. Namibia also derives about $75 million annually from
 the South African Customs and Excise Union.
 Women face considerable discrimination in Namibia, under both
 South African law and local tradition. There is no clear and
 consistent policy on which dictates are invoked in any given
 circumstance. Under traditional rural custom, the woman is
 usually the ward of either her father or, if she is married,
 her husband. She is never independent. Women in higher
 socio-economic groups reportedly elude such straight
 categorization, but even in the modern sector, some married
 women complain that they are unable to borrow money or own
 property without their husband's approval. Women tend to be
 subject to salary discrimination as well. One leading female
 political figure said in October that women's political groups
 seem to be emerging, though they are very much in the nascent
 stage.
