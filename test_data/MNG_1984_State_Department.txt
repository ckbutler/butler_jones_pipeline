 MONGOLIA*
 Mongolia, or the Mongolian People's Republic, is a rigidly
 controlled Communist state. Only the Mongolian Communist
 Party, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP), is
 permitted to function. The leadership of the country is
 vested in a 10-person Politburo of the MPRP Central Committee
 headed by 58 year old Jambyn Batmonh. Nominally, the People's
 Great Hural, or national assembly, enacts the basic laws of
 the country. It meets for three days once each year. Between
 sessions, the Council of Ministers (cabinet), appointed by the
 Hural, issues current legislation. The Great Hural appointed
 Dumaagiyn Sodnom Chairman of the Council of Ministers on
 December 12, 1984.
 The Soviet Union dominates Mongolia politically and
 economically. The Mongolian state is modeled on the Soviet
 system, and MPRP leaders travel to Moscow for consultations
 often. The Soviets guarantee their influence by stationing
 approximately five combat divisions on Mongolian soil. As in
 the political arena, Mongolian economic life is shaped by the
 Soviet Bloc: 95 percent of Mongolia's foreign trade is
 conducted with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Soviet
 involvement in the Mongolian economy is largely exploitative,
 particularly in the area of mining and mineral exporting. The
 Mongolian economy remains heavily agricultural with an
 emphasis on live animals and animal products.
 Little information is available concerning the internal
 treatment of Mongolian citizens. There are no known domestic
 Mongolian opposition groups. Much of what information is
 available comes from the Mongolian regime. The few resident
 diplomats and occasional visitors to Mongolia are mainly
 limited to the capital city of Ulaanbaatar. Travel to other
 parts of the country is restricted.
 It is known, however, that Mongolian life and society are
 highly regimented. Few Mongolians are authorized to travel
 outside the Soviet Bloc countries. No political opposition to
 the ruling Communist Party is permitted. Freedoms guaranteed
 to the individual under the Mongolian Constitution, including
 speech, demonstration, and assembly, can be exercised only to
 'strengthen the socialist state system." In effect,
 individual civil and political liberties do not exist and
 there is nothing to indicate that this situation is likely to
 change in the foreseeable future.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There is no information available concerning political killing
 by the government.
 *The United States has never recognized nor has it had
 diplomatic relations with the Mongolian People's Republic, and
 thus does not have direct access to human rights information
 there. It is difficult, therefore, to comment authoritatively
 on specific conditions in this country.

 b. Disappearance
 Though there is no reliable information available concerning
 disappearance; high governmental officials occasionally
 disappear from public view and no information is released
 concerning their fate.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 We have no information available concerning this subject.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There is no information available on this question.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Current civil and criminal codes stipulate the right of the
 accused to judicial process, a legal defense, and public trial
 *except as stipulated by law.* Closed proceedings are
 permitted in the case of crimes against the state. As the
 civil code places a heavy emphasis on this category of crimes,
 and since the MPRP controls all legal systems, those accused of
 such crimes are unlikely to receive a fair trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There is no information available concerning the application
 of these rights by Mongolian authorities. The right to
 privacy of person, home, and correspondence is guaranteed in
 the Constitution. Travel, as well as job and residence
 changes, are decided in accordance with economic needs as
 determined by the state. It is highly doubtful that this
 right is honored when it conflicts with the interests of the
 state.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Mongolian Constitution provides for freedom of speech, but
 specifies that the exercise of individual rights must be to
 'strengthen the socialist state system.* Actions deemed by
 the party to fall outside this parameter would likely result
 in arrest and detention. Criticism of the Government is not
 tolerated. Discipline is exercised through various
 government-controlled organizations, notably the People's
 Control Organization, extending down to the neighborhood
 committee level. The press is state-owned and strictly
 controlled by the Government. It serves primarily as a
 propaganda tool. Non-Communist foreign media representatives
 are generally not allowed into the country. Academic and
 artistic life is also tightly controlled in accordance with
 government policy.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of demonstration and assembly are guaranteed by the
 Constitution, but in practice only government-authorized
 organizations are permitted to assemble and the only
 demonstrations allowed are carefully orchestrated by
 government authorities. A wide variety of organizations,
 including professional and trade unions, exist, but all are
 controlled and directed by the Government to promote its
 policies. Mongolia is a member of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO).

 C. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion exists in theory, but religious activity
 is strictly controlled through an Office of Religious Affairs
 attached to the Council of Ministers. Religion no longer has
 a significant part in the lives of most Mongolians. The
 Buddhist church, a central force in Mongolian life prior to
 the establishment of the Communist Government, has been
 reduced to a few showcase monasteries and a handful of monks.
 They serve primarily as propagandists and as showpieces for
 tourists. Religious figures do not hold high positions in
 government.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Until recent years, few Mongolians traveled abroad. Foreign
 travel usually has been permitted only for official purposes,
 but government-sponsored education abroad has become
 increasingly common. As many as 40,000 Mongolian youth go to
 the Soviet Union yearly for short training programs. Yet,
 almost all travel abroad remains restricted to Soviet Bloc
 countries. There is no known emigration from Mongolia. No
 Mongolians are known to have requested repatriation to
 Mongolia.
 All Mongolians over 16 years of age must have internal
 passports and must obtain permission from the Security Bureau
 in order to travel within the country. Attempts to change
 jobs or residences must be approved by both the Security
 Bureau and the People's Control Organization.
 Although the 1978 Constitution guarantees the right "to reside
 in the territory of the MPR' to foreign citizens, Mongolian
 authorities began a systematic expulsion of ethnic Chinese,
 most of whom reside in and around Ulaanbaatar, in May 1983.
 Many of the six to seven thousand ethnic Chinese in Mongolia
 were evidently offered a choice between resettlement in the
 barren northern part of the country or expulsion to China.
 The Mongolian authorities claimed the expellees had no formal
 occupation and/or did not abide by Mongolian law, despite the
 fact many of them had been living and working in Mongolia
 since the 1950's.
 By late September 1983, over two thousand Chinese had returned
 by train to the People's Republic of China. Many of the
 expellees were reported to have been stripped of their
 personal property by the Mongolian customs authorities before
 being allowed to cross the Chinese border.
 The expulsions continued in 1984, though apparently at a
 reduced rate. Some estimates place the number of Chinese who
 left Mongolia in 1984 at approximately 1,000. If these
 estimates are correct, then nearly half of the Chinese
 population in Mongolia has been forced to leave the country by
 the authorities. Although the Mongolian People's Republic has
 reportedly moderated its oppressive expulsion practice
 somewhat, and no longer confiscates the possessions of
 departing Chinese, the authorities still appear determined to
 expel or widely disperse the entire Chinese community.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party does not tolerate
 political groups outside its control. The Party is
 established on the Soviet model with a narrow pyramid of power
 topped by Party General Secretary Batmonh. In August 1984,
 Batmonh replaced his predecessor, Yumjaagiyn Tsedenbal, who
 was said to have acquiesced in the decision. Most observers
 attribute Tsedenbal's replacement to health considerations and
 believe the move was sanctioned if not inspired by Moscow, and
 will result in no significant domestic or foreign policy
 changes. Nothing has been heard of Tsedenbal since his
 replacement.
 Lower-ranking members of the MPRP have no real ability to
 influence the decisions of their superiors. Elections are
 held at regular intervals, but only one candidate is listed
 for each office. Many elections result in a 99.9 percent
 turnout. Winning candidates regularly receive 99.9 percent of
 the vote. Although there is no officially espoused policy of
 minority discrimination, there is little evidence of any
 minorities occupying elite party or government positions.
 Universal suffrage is official policy.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 There have been no known opportunities for outside
 investigators to examine human rights practices. It is highly
 unlikely that Mongolian officials would permit such an
 investigation by any outside authority or organization. There
 in no known organization dedicated to the protection of human
 rights in Mongolia. The Amnesty International 1984 Report did
 not contain an entry for Mongolia. It categorized that
 country among those on which there was insufficient
 information to allow an entry. Freedom House's 1984-85 report
 listed it as 'not free.*
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 World Bank and Mongolian Government statistics tend to confirm
 Mongolian claims of some improvement in the standard of
 living. Mongolian figures indicate that there were 22.4
 physicians per 10,000 population in 1982 and that the infant
 mortality rate had declined to 47.8 per 1,000 live births in
 1984. Life expectancy at birth rose from 52 years in 1960 to
 65.3 years in 1984. Education has been a high priority since
 the mid-1950's. Mongolian Government statistics show the
 total number of students per 10,000 persons increased from
 1,375 in 1960 to 2,758 in 1980. There appears to be little
 sexual, racial or religious discrimination in education.
 According to the World Bank, the adjusted primary school
 enrollment ratio for males in 1981 was 107 and that for
 females was 102. The Government claims universal literacy
 within Mongolia. The seventh five-year plan (1981-85)
 continues to encourage the learning of the Russian as the
 primary foreign language in the Mongolian educational system.

 The percentage of calories available for consumption relative
 to nutritional needs reached 11 percent in 1982 according to
 the World Bank. Gross national product per capita in 1979 was
 Us $780.00. Population figures in 1984 show 1,860,000 people
 in Mongolia. The population growth rate slowed slightly from
 2.9 percent in the 1960's and 1970's to a 1984 figure of 2.7.
 Despite the substantial rise in the Mongolian standard of
 living over the last fifty years, the country remains extremely
 backward. The majority of the population is still engaged in
 agriculture, primarily herding. National economic growth is
 severely limited by an inefficient and over-centralized
 bureaucracy and a centrally-run economy subordinated to the
 Committee for Mutual Economic Assistance, a Soviet-dominated
 organization. These combine with a lack of resources, extreme
 geographic isolation, and a severe climate to keep the quality
 of Mongolian life poor by international standards.
 The official policy of the Government is to accord equal rights
 to women. According to Mongolian government statistics, the
 percentage of women in the workforce rose from 30 to 46 percent
 between 1960 and 1980. While few women occupy positions of
 responsibility in the Government or in the MPRP, it is reported
 that they hold high professional positions in institutions such
 as hospitals.
