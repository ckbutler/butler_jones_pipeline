 THE GAMBIA
 The Gambia's tradition of political tranquility and its
 enviable human rights record were put to a severe test
 when an attempted coup d'etat by self-proclaimed Marxist-
 Leninist elements convulsed the country from July 30 through
 the first week of August. Although the bloody uprising was
 eventually put down with the assistance of Senegalese
 troops, the government was forced to declare a state of
 emergency and has detained over 900 persons.
 In a savage and increasingly indiscriminate attack, the
 plotters sought outside support, freed criminals from
 prison and distributed arms to the populace. The govern-
 ment's response reflected concern for human rights consider-
 ations, although there were undoubtedly lapses in the heat
 of battle. The sheer numbers involved have swamped the tiny
 government's efforts to move as fast as it would like in
 processing the cases of the detainees. President Jawara
 stated publicly that the events had "not diminished in any
 way whatsoever my own and my government's commitment to
 democracy and respect for human rights overseas.* The
 emergency regulations have given the government very broad
 authority, which is reinforced by the presence of outside
 forces (Senegalese) under a mutual defense treaty. The
 Gambia and Senegal have ratified a treaty of confederation.
 Plans presently call for a combined army and police force
 with an eventual monetary union. Both nations, however,
 will retain sovereignty. It is not clear what effect, if
 any, the proposed confederation will have on observance of
 human rights in The Gambia.
 Already a poor nation, The Gambia suffered economically
 from the summer's events, potentially most heavily in
 the tourism field. However, favorable seasonal rains after
 many years of drought augur well for the 85 percent of the
 work force on farms and should permit continued progress
 toward the social and economic development mandated by the
 government's planning. A number of countries have contri-
 buted generously to The Gambia's relief programs following
 the uprising.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The constitution specifically states that *no person shall
 be subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading punishment."
 This prohibition is respected and enforced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Inhuman or degrading punishment is proscribed by the consti-
 tution. Gambian law prohibits capital punishment; execu-
 tions, summary or otherwise, are nonexistent. Sentences,
 fines and imprisonment are uniformly administered based on
 the severity of the crime committed. Minimum and maximum
 security prisons are internally segregated on the basis of
 sex alone. Although those detained during and after the
 July/August fighting were initially subjected to severe
 
 
 99
 conditions, the government has moved to bring conditions
 into line with acceptable standards. Representatives of the
 local branch of the Red Cross accompanied by physicians have
 visited the detainees, and the government has announced that
 interested persons are free to visit them.
 c. Disappearances
 There is no record, past or present, of persons being
 abducted, secretly arrested or held in clandestine detention
 by official or quasi-official security forces or by elements
 whose activities are condoned by the Gambian Government.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There is no record in recent years of persons being arrested
 or detained without due process of law. The right of habeas
 corpus is implicit in the constitution and is respected.
 The emergency powers regulations in force give the government
 broad latitude to detain persons suspected of acts prejudicial
 to public safety or order and indeed permit the police to
 hold such persons up to 14 days without a detention order.
 Detainees are, however, free to exercise their right to
 legal counsel.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The constitution guarantees everyone charged with a criminal
 offense a fair hearing within a reasonable period of time
 before an independent and impartial court. The defendant is
 presumed innocent until proven guilty and informed, in a
 language clearly understood, of the nature of the offense
 charged. He is given adequate time and facilities for
 preparation of his defense, permitted the right to legal
 counsel, granted the right to cross-examination of witnesses,
 and where necessary the free assistance of an interpreter.
 The Gambian judiciary is independent of the executive, and
 there is a right of appeal to a higher court.
 Under the emergency powers regulations, the judiciary is
 given broad latitude in the conduct of trials. A quasi-
 judicial review tribunal is considering the cases of the 900
 detainees for recommendation of possible prosecution. The
 process is slow, with only 20 persons cleared and released
 by the end of September. On September 24, the government
 announced that it would establish five courts as a special
 division of the supreme court to be made up of attorneys
 from other Commonwealth countries. These would try those
 detainees-who are prosecuted. The government has sent out
 delegations to several anglophone countries to recruit
 judges in order to expedite the trial process for the coup
 detainees and ensure impartiality of the trials.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution provides adequate safeguards to protect the
 individual's right to privacy. No person may be subjected
 to search, seizure of his property or arbitrary entry into
 his home without warrant. Exceptions are made only on the
 basis of (1) voluntary consent of the individual, or (2) a
 clearly demonstrated public need (i.e., defense, public
 safety, public order, public morality, public health).

 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The Gambia has a good record in granting and protecting the
 individual's rights to these basic freedoms. The emergency
 powers regulations, however, prohibit the publication of
 items or use of slogans or other demonstrations of sentiment
 likely to incite or cause disaffection or alarm or be pre-
 judicial to public safety, public order, or the maintenance
 of essential services or supplies. This rather sweeping
 formulation, and the requirement that public meetings be
 cleared in advance with the police, have as a practical
 matter helped block open criticism of the government.
 Gambians may form or belong to trade unions or other
 associations for the protection of mutual interests.
 Article 13 of the constitution, which is observed in practice,
 protects the individual's right to freedom of conscience,
 thought and religion, freedom to change religion or belief,
 and the freedom, either alone or in community with others,
 to practice and propagate religious beliefs. No person is
 compelled to take an oath which is contrary to the individual's
 own religion or belief. Also, no person attending any
 educational facility is compelled to receive instruction or
 attend any ceremony which contravenes his religious tenets.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 In general, there are no restrictions on movement into, within
 or out of The Gambia, although a police clearance is now
 required before departure. All citizens are immune from
 expulsion from the country. There are occasional internal
 police checkpoints to check documents.
 Small numbers of refugees have entered The Gambia from other,
 more drought-stricken regions of the Sahel. Language, tribal
 and ethnic similarities have facilitated their rapid integration
 into The Gambian agricultural sector.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Gambia is a parliamentary democracy based on a function-
 ing multiparty system. Elections are expected next in the
 spring of 1982. Under current conditions, in which, for
 example, two members of the parliamentary opposition are
 among those detained, the strictures of the emergency powers
 regulations reduce political activity to a virtual standstill.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Proud of its excellent record in the human rights field, the
 government has been highly sensitive to scattered foreign
 media allegations about conditions under the emergency
 powers regulations. President Jawara has stated that outside
 groups can visit the detainees.

 4. -conomic and Social Circumstances
 There is no intentional discrimination in The Gambia con-
 cerning access to health, education and other services.
 Indeed the .government is seeking to reduce economic and
 social disparities.. But The Gambia is a poor country (GNP is
 about $250 per capita), heavily dependent on the vagaries of
 Sahelian agriculture (which accounts for 55 percent of the
 GDP), and substantial rural-urban differences persist.
 The rural population (85 percent) remains comparatively
 disadvantaged in economic and social terms, with an estimated
 40 percent below the absolute poverty line. Although the
 situation is improving, women are underrepresented in
 the miniscule modern sector and in educational opportunities.
 The Gambia is making efforts to upgrade education, particu-
 larly in rural areas, with an emphasis on vocational training.
 Despite an adjusted.primary school enrollment ratio of 37
 percent (50 percent of males, 24 percent of females) where
 facilities exist, the total adult literacy rate is only an
 -estimated 10 percent.
 Life expectancy at birth has risen to 41, while the population
 growth rate remains over two and one-half percent. There is
 concern-for public-health-precautions and the average
 nutritional level is high.
