 MAURITIUS
 Mauritius is a small, densely populated island country with a
 fully functioning parliamentary democracy modeled after that
 of Great Britain. Mauritius is governed by a Prime Minister,
 who currently heads a coalition government, a Council of
 Ministers, and a Legislative Assembly. A Governor General,
 with largely ceremonial powers, represents Queen Elizabeth II,
 the titular head of state. Elections at national and local
 levels take place at regular intervals. There are five major
 political parties with wide-ranging ideologies, and several
 smaller parties. Executive power has changed hands twice in
 the last 4 years through fair and orderly elections supervised
 by an independent commission. Municipal elections in 1985 in
 Mauritius' five largest cities returned the main opposition
 party to power in three of five cities.
 Mauritius has no military forces and depends on the
 paramilitary 700-man Special Mobile Force and the 240-man
 Police Riot Unit for internal security. These forces, under
 the command of the Commissioner of Police, are apolitical,
 well-trained, and backed in times of unrest by a general duty
 police force of approximately 4,000 men.
 Mauritius has a mixed economy, based on sugar production,
 tourism, and textiles, with a strong private sector. In 1985,
 the economy continued its recovery, registering a 4 percent
 growth rate and creating of some 12,000 jobs. Mauritius
 maintained readjustment policies in line with guidelines from
 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.
 Political and civil rights, including the freedoms of speech
 and press, are protected under the Mauritian Constitution and
 exercised in practice. There are 290 labor unions which enjoy
 considerable freedom in contract negotiations and within the
 political arena, although their right to strike is limited by
 law. Religious freedom is respected in this society which has
 large Hindu, Christian, and Moslem populations. Mauritius'
 independent judiciary administers a legal system patterned on
 the British model. Since independence in 1968, there have
 been no reports of political killings, disappearances,
 torture, or degrading treatment of prisoners.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings in 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports of disappearance of persons in
 Mauritius for political causes.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture and inhuman punishment are prohibited by law, and
 there have been no reports of degrading treatment or
 punishment. There have been reports of overcrowding in local
 prisons, a condition which the Government is striving to
 
 
 217
 MAURITIUS
 overcome through the allocation of additional resources for
 the prison sector.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There have been no reports of arbitrary arrests or detention
 since the early. 1970's, when some opposition politicians and
 trade union leaders were jailed, accused of creating chaos.
 Habeas corpus exists in practice, and a person can be held
 only for brief periods without being charged. Bail is
 commonly granted. Exile is legally prohibited and not used as
 a form of punishment. The Constitution prohibits any form of
 forced or compulsory labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Mauritius' judicial system, modeled on that of Great Britain,
 consists of a Supreme Court with appellate powers and a series
 of lower courts. Final appeal may be made to the Queen's
 Privy Council in the United Kingdom. There are no political
 or military courts. The legal system has a good record of
 providing fair, public trials to those charged with crimes.
 Defendants have the right to private or court-appointed
 counsel. The judiciary is also charged under the Constitution
 with ensuring that new laws are consistent with democratic
 practice. In January 1985, a government commission chaired by
 a former supreme court justice investigated charges of fraud
 and corruption against several government officials. The
 commission exonerated the officials, but the opposition
 accused the commission chairman of bias and challenged the
 commission findings in the Supreme Court. The cases are still
 being adjudicated.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home is guaranteed by law and generally
 respected in practice. The search of personal property or
 premises is allowed only under clearly specified conditions by
 court order or by police decision if an illegal act has been
 committed. Police conform to well-established procedures in
 performing their duties. There have been allegations that the
 Government's intelligence apparatus occasionally opens mail,
 carries out wiretaps, and exercises surveillance of local
 opposition leaders and other major figures.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freudom of speech and press is protected by the Constitution
 and by local tradition. Sixteen privately owned daily and
 weekly newspapers present varying political viewpoints and
 freely express partisan views. Newspapers are subject only to
 the legal constraints of libel laws. There is one television
 station and one radio station, both government-controlled,
 broadcasting in five languages. These stations are reasonably
 objective in news and entertainment presentation, although
 opposition politicians occasionally accuse the stations of
 political bias in their news coverage. In March 1985, the
 Parliament passed an act which made it a felony to charge
 without proof in speech or print that a government minister
 was corrupt in exercising official functions. The first
 offense brings a $600 fine; the second, 3 years in prison.
 No one has been prosecuted under this law.
 
 
 MAURITIUS
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Mauritians enjoy the right to form associations, including
 political parties, trade unions, and religious organizations.
 Mauritius has a multitude of such private organizations.
 Political, cultural, and religious assemblies are
 commonplace. Although police permission is required for
 holding demonstrations and mass meetings, such permission is
 rarely refused. May Day rallies held in 1985 by all major
 political parties attracted a total of 75,000 supporters.
 Mauritius has an active and widespread trade union movement.
 Almost 300 unions represent 90,000 workers, more than
 one-fourth of the work force. Unions are free to organize
 workers in all sectors, including the export processing zones
 (EPZ) which employ about 40,000 workers. Unions can press
 wage demands, establish ties to domestic political parties and
 international organizations, and address political issues.
 One leading federation actively supports the main opposition
 party. The largest confederation, the Mauritian Labor
 Congress, is a member of the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions. Unions in theory have the right to
 strike. Nonetheless, in labor disputes the Industrial
 Relations Act requires a prestrike 21-day cooling off period
 followed by binding arbitration, which has the effect of
 circumventing most strikes. Some labor leaders have expressed
 concern over the elimination in January 1985 of minimum wage
 rates for male workers in the EPZ, and the unwillingness of
 some new EPZ investors to fully recognize their unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no official state religion in Mauritius. Hindus,
 Christians, Moslems, Tamils, Buddhists, and others openly
 practice and teach their religions and proselytize without
 prejudice. All religious institutions receive state subsidies
 in proportion to their membership. There is no
 state-sanctioned discrimination against any ethnic or
 religious community.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on full freedom of movement within
 the country, foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation.
 There have been no reports of abuses in these areas.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Mauritius is governed by a freely elected, unicameral
 legislative assembly, with executive direction coming from a
 Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister. The
 parliamentary opposition leader enjoys a special status in the
 legislative assembly. A Governor General, appointed on the
 advice of the Prime Minister, represents Queen Elizabeth II,
 who is also Queen of Mauritius. While the role is largely
 ceremonial, the Governor General has the right to designate
 the person to try to form a new government following
 parliamentary elections or a parliamentary crisis.
 Parliamentary, municipal, and village council elections are
 held at regular intervals. Voting and running for office are
 open to all citizens 18 years of age and over. In Parliament,
 8 of the 70 members are appointed via a complex "best loser"
 
 
 219
 MAURITIUS
 system designed in part to ensure that all ethnic groups are
 adequately represented. Political parties often match the
 ethnicity or religion of their candidates to the composition
 of particular electoral constituencies. There have been
 allegations that certain groups, including Muslims, are
 underrepresented in the civil service.
 In December 1985, municipal elections took place in the five
 largest cities in Mauritius. The elections were supervised by
 an independent commission and were preceded by intense
 campaigning, including regular public rallies. In the end,
 the opposition retained control of three of the five municipal
 governments.
 Women in Mauritius participate in all types of political,
 business, and social activities, and a few hold important
 positions. Nonetheless, only 4 of the 70 members of
 Parliament and 1 of 19 ministers are women.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude.Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no known reports of requests by international
 organizations to investigate human rights violations in
 Mauritius. Amnesty International maintains two branches in
 Mauritius. There are several local human rights groups which
 address the internal situation in Mauritius without government
 intrusion. Amnesty International in its 1985 report noted
 that the first execution (for murder) in over 23 years
 occurred in 1984 after an appeal to the Privy Council was
 rejected.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Mauritius is a relatively prosperous island state with a
 population of just over 1 million and a 1983 per capita income
 of $1,160. The Mauritian economy is based on sugar
 production, textile manufacture, and tourism. A strong
 private sector works hand-in-hand with the Government and with
 state-owned enterprises. After economic difficulties in the
 early 1980s, Mauritius has made a sustained recovery, based in
 part on policies designed to limit government interference in
 the economy, to encourage industry and tourism, to diversify
 agriculture, and to restructure the sugar sector. Foreign
 assistance from bilateral and multilateral sources, including
 the IMF and World Bank, has also contributed to rapid
 recovery. More than 12,000 new jobs were created in 1985, and
 unemployment fell to about 17% by the end of the year. Gross
 domestic product grew by 4 percent.
 Medical care is available to all Mauritians through an
 expanding network of free government hospitals and clinics.
 The system emphasizes basic health needs and preventive care.
 Those requiring complex treatment must travel abroad. Faced
 with one of the world's highest population densities,
 Mauritius has stressed mother-child health care and family
 planning. The population growth rate has declined rapidly
 during the past two decades, and the 1985 rate is 0.9
 percent. Infant mortality has fallen equally fast to about 25
 per 2,000 live births. Life expectancy at birth is more than
 67 years. Malnutrition is not a serious problem, with latest
 figures showing calorie supply exceeding nutritional
 requirements by 17 percent. Access to safe water in both
 rural and urban areas is virtually universal.
 
 
 220
 MAURITIUS
 Mauritius places a high priority on education, with the
 education ministry receiving the largest allocation in the
 1985/86 budget: about $36 million. Education in both English
 and French is free and accessible to all through secondary
 school. Enrollment in primary school is universal. Adult
 literacy is 79 percent (1980 figure). The nation's only
 university teaches a technical curriculum to 400 students.
 Other secondary school graduates must go abroad for university
 education.
 Conditions of employment in Mauritius, including wage and
 leave conditions, are generally sufficient to afford an
 acceptable standard of living for workers in the agricultural,
 service, and manufacturing sectors. A maximum workweek of 45
 hours is allowed, and children below the age of 14 cannot be
 legally employed, although scattered cases of child labor have
 been reported. The Government mandates minimum wage increases
 each year based on inflation. It also operates an
 unemployment insurance program and a social security fund,
 although an effective social safety net does not yet exist.
 Mauritius has stringent health and safety legislation which
 requires, inter alia, that a full-time health and safety
 inspector be present at all major industrial and agricultural
 work places. This legislation is being updated with the
 assistance of the International Labor Organization.
 The Mauritian Government has sought to improve the status of
 women. Recent amendments to laws ranging from emigration to
 inheritance have removed sexually discriminatory sections. An
 interministerial committee headed by the Minister of Women's
 Rights and Family Affairs (a woman) was formed in April to
 remove remaining discrimination from local laws and
 practices. Some inequality remains, however, including a
 prohibition against women serving on juries. The Ministry of
 Women's Rights and Family Affairs receives one of the smallest
 ministerial allocations: just $300,000 in 1985/86. While
 women are highly sought for employment in manufacturing
 plants, they tend to occupy the less skilled and lower paid
 positions and are particularly susceptible to layoffs during
 economic downturns. The average industrial salary for women
 is about 30 percent less than that of men.
