 COMOROS
 Located in the Mozambique Channel between East Africa and
 Madagascar, the Federal and Islamic Republic of the Comoros
 comprises three islands and claims a fourth, Mayotte, which is
 governed by France. Until his assassination in November 1989,
 President Abdallah, backed by the presidential guard, presided
 over a de facto one-party state. Following his assassination,
 some 25 European mercenaries who had served as officers in the
 presidential guard briefly became the ruling authority until
 French troops arrived to stabilize the situation.
 Early in 1990, opposition politicians returned from exile, and a
 wide spectrum of political leaders and eight political parties
 contested presidential elections in two stages. The acting
 President, Said Mohamed Djohar, emerged the winner in the second
 round. His defeated opponent, Mohamed Taki, refused to accept
 the results and departed the country for several months. Though
 allegations of fraud and tampering with ballot boxes were made
 by opposing political parties, most outside observers, including
 representatives from the Organization of African Unity,
 concluded that these instances did not decisively alter the
 results. Following his inauguration on March 20, 1991, the new
 President vowed to promote full democracy and became leader of a
 coalition of five parties, naming some former opposition figures
 to ministerial positions.
 French military advisors assisted the new Government in
 restructuring and reducing the regular military and police
 forces. In 1991 the security forces came under effective
 civilian control.
 Agriculture dominates the economy, but the Comoros is running
 out of arable land, and soil erosion on the steep volcanic
 slopes is exacerbating the problem. Revenues from the main
 crops--vanilla, essence of ylang-ylang, and cloves--continued to
 fall. Comoros is part of the French Franc Monetary Zone and
 depends heavily on France for budgetary support and technical
 and security assistance.
 The human rights situation has improved significantly since
 1989, but progress slowed in 1991 with the postponement of both
 legislative elections and revision of the Constitution to
 establish firmly a multiparty system. This slower pace of
 change was due in part to cabinet changes, the distraction of
 natural disasters (volcanic activity), and an attempted coup
 d'etat in August involving Supreme Court figures. Efforts to
 institutionalize democratic practices and the protection of
 human rights continue to be hampered by the lack of internal
 security arrangements and poor economic conditions.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no confirmed reports of such killing in 1991.
 However, the case of Said Mlindre, a member of presidential
 candidate Taki's political party who died in 1990 while in
 government custody, continued to be raised by the political
 opposition. The Government maintains he died of natural causes,
 while his family alleges torture and poisoning. A doctor who
 attended Mlindre on the night of his death testified he was
 unable to determine whether the death was natural or inflicted.

 COMOROS
 He said he lacked the means to perform an autopsy, and the
 family insisted on immediate burial. No new information was
 developed in 1991.
 -b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were no substantiated reports-of torture or other cruel,-
 inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment in 1991. However,
 various opposition newspapers and human rights groups maintained,
 that Said Mlindre and others detained in August 1990i- including
 a journalist, had been tortured.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In 1991 there'were no known cases of arbitrary arrest or
 detention, although the circumstances surrounding the detention
 of Said Mlindre and other Taki supporters had not been fully
 clarified. After Djohar's election in-March 1990, there were
 clashes in early April between security forces and opposition
 supporters. Eighteen'of those involved were arrested and held
 without.charge. Fourteen were released in September and the
 remaining four in October without coming to trial.4 The law
 provides for a detained person to be charged.within 48 hours,
 but this procedure was not followed in the case of Mlindre and
 the others arrested in 1990.-
 Numerous opposition political figures, who had been abroad in
 exile during the Abdallah period, returned to the Comoros in
 early 1990 to participate in the presidential elections.
 Mohammed Taki, who remained in self-imposed exile for most of
 1991, returned to the Comoros at the end of the year.
 e. Denial'of Fair Public Trial
 The 1978-Constitution provides for the equality of all citizens
 before the law and the right of all accused to defense counsel.
 The Comorian legal system applies Islamic law and an inherited
 French legal code. Most disputes are settled by village elders
 or by a civilian court of first instance. In regular civil and
 criminal cases, the judiciary is largely independent, and trials
 are public. However, in national security cases observed since
 1990, suspects were never brought to trial. Most were
 subsequently freed, but only after a period of detention of up
 to 1 year. The Supreme Court has the power to review-the
 decisions of lower courts, including the Court of Appeals.
 National security cases --involving attempts to destabilize the
 country or overthrow the Government by violent means-are
 handled in the regular court system.
 In 1991 the only important national security case involved
 members and supporters of the Supreme Court.who attempted a
 "legal coup d'etat" by declaring the President unfit for
 office. They invoked articles of the Constitution which would
 install the President of the Supreme Court as head of state.
 The attempt failed, and six persons, including Supreme Court
 President Ahmed Talidi, were placed under house arrest and
 awaited trial at year-'s end. The President has stated that he
 is willing to drop their case; however, the former, head of the
 Supreme Court still insists he should be head of state.

 COMOROS
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for the inviolability of home and
 property. There were no known cases of arbitrary interference
 with privacy or correspondence in 1991.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedoms of expression, thought,
 and conscience. In contrast to the experience under the
 Abdallah regime, these freedoms were generally respected during
 1991. Comorians discussd and criticized the Government and its
 leading personalities openly. A wide spectrum of political
 views were aired in roundtable discussions leading up to the
 1992 presidential elections. Radio broadcasts from Mayotte and
 two French television stations are received on parts of the
 islands without interference. Satellite antennas are popular,
 and amateur radio licenses are easily obtained.
 The print media continue to enjoy a significant degree of
 openness, and several small independent newspapers are now
 published. The semiofficial newspaper, which became a weekly,
 publishes articles critical of some government policies. Lack
 of funds and illiteracy are the biggest obstacles to wider
 publication and distribution of the newspapers. Foreign
 journals and newspapers are available, as are books from
 abroad. The Paris-based Indian Ocean Newsletter and Lettre de
 Comores, which are often highly critical of the Government,
 arrive through the international mail without interference.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association. Under the late president Abdallah, Comorians were
 circumspect about organizing public political gatherings, and
 political groupings kept a fairly low profile. All of this
 changed in 1990 and 1991 as new political parties were formed,
 old ones were resurrected, and numerous rallies and assemblies
 took place with a minimum of governmental interference. No
 political parties have been banned. At the'end of the year,
 there were approximately 18 political parties.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 An overwhelming majority of the population is Sunni Muslim. The
 Constitution holds Islam to be the "wellspring of the principles
 and rules which guide the State and its institutions." The
 State upholds the right of non-Muslims to practice their faith,
 and there are churches for the small Catholic and Protestant
 populations. Christian missions work in local hospitals and
 schools, but by local custom they are not allowed to proselytize.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on'travel within the country or
 abroad, and exit visas are freely granted.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens now have the right to change their government through
 peaceful means. No less than 14 political groups were
 
 
 COMOROS
 represented in the roundtable discussions held prior to the 1990
 elections; 8 of these fielded candidates for the elections. The
 candidates issued platforms of varying ideological positions,
 which were published in the semiofficial newspaper. In the
 second round runoff, Said Mohamed.Djohar defeated Mohamed Taki
 by gaining 55 percent of the votes.
 At the end of 1991, the-Government consisted of a coalition of
 five parties..- The 1978 Constitution was being rewritten to give
 legal status to a multiparty system and to provide for other
 fundamental rights. After the presidential election in early
 1990, it was envisioned that a new constitution could be quickly
 written and ratified and that-legislative elections could take
 place in the fall of that year. However,-the dates were
 constantly postponed because of political, procedural, and
 economic problems. Some parties insisted that the elections
 should take place before the referendum on the constitution.
 Further, the August 1991 coup attempt set'back the.political
 reform timetable because of the prominence of the people and the
 institution involved and the lack of established procedures to
 guide the process (see Section-l.e.). Legislative elections
 must take place before March of 1992 as the legislators' terms
 expire in that month.-
 Traditional social, religious, and economic institutions also
 importantly influence the country's political life. Interisland
 rivalries have been a persistent and growing factor. Village
 notables and Muslim religious leaders tend to dominate local
 politics.     -
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation. of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 .An organization called the Comorian Association for the Rights
 of Man was established in May 1990. It has been active in
 pursuing human rights causes, including the Said Mlindre case,
 with no interference from the Government. This Association has
 exerted pressure on the Government to free those prisoners -
 detained for probable political reasons but who have not been
 charged with national security violations--with the exception of
 those Supreme Court members currently under house arrest. The
 Association tends to focus publicly on women's rights and on
 raising the minimum wage.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution formally provides for the equality of citizens
 regardless of race, sex, or religion. Nevertheless, within
 Comorian society, men have the dominant role. In theory, women
 have the right to vote and participate in the political process
 as candidates, but tradition has been a powerful force in
 discouraging women from direct participation in politics.
 Change in the status of women is most evident in the major
 towns, whete women are finding increasing employment
 opportunities in the small paid labor force and generally
 receiving wages comparable to those of men in similar work.
 However, school enrollments for females'are well below those for
 males. In August the first Comorian woman was appointed to a
 high government position: Sittou Raghadat Mohamed was named
 Secretary-of State for Population and the Condition of Women. A
 Comorian Women's Federation, formed in late 1989, aims to
 assemble and propose a family bill of rights. Women are not
 required to wear a veil. Property rights do not disfavor women;
 for example, the house the father- of the bride traditionally
 
 
 84
 COMOROS
 provided to the couple at the time of their marriage remains her
 property, even in the case of divorce.
 Violence against women, including wife beating, occurs.
 However, medical authorities, the Women's Federation, and the
 police believe that violence against women is rare, partly
 because of the nonviolent nature of Comorian society. The
 Government has not addressed this issue specifically, and there
 are no studies or statistics available to help determine the
 extent of the problem. In principle, a woman can seek
 protection through the courts in the case of violence, but in
 reality the issue would most likely be addressed within the
 extended family or at the village level. Female circumcision is
 not known to be practiced in the Comoros.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution allows workers to form unions and to strike,
 but these rights only became a reality in 1990 aad 1991 with the
 association of some workers into unions. Farming on small land
 holdings, subsistence fishing, and petty commerce make up the
 daily activity of most of the population. Hence, the wage labor
 force is small (less than 2,000 excluding government
 employees). For the first time in 1990, however, groups of
 teachers, civil servants, and dock workers--which in previous
 years formed temporary associations to press their
 demands--formed into unions for purposes of collective action.
 In 1991 there were work stoppages and slowdowns by all three
 groups. The Government did not interfere with these actions,
 but the basic issues of low or late wages remained unsolved
 because of the country's financial and economic problems.
 Unions are free to join in confederations and to associate with
 international bodies, although given the nascent state of union
 development these rights have not yet been exercised.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Laws do not prohibit antiunion discrimination or protect
 collective bargaining, which is still in its infancy in the
 Comoros. Labor legislation, to the extent that it exists, is
 found mainly in the Labor Code, which is not rigidly enforced.
 The Labor Code does not address collective bargaining. The
 private sector sets wages by informal employee/employer
 negotiations. Public workers' wages are set by government
 policy through the Ministries of Finance and Labor. Economic
 rather than political impediments stand in the way of a more
 active role by labor organizations. Unofficial unemployment
 figures exceed 70 percent. There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is forbidden by the Constitution and
 not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Labor Code defines 15 years as the minimum age for the
 employment of children. The Ministry of Labor is lax about
 enforcing this provision. Child labor is not an issue due to
 the lack of employment opportunities for adolescents and young
 adults. Children generally help with the work of their families
 in the large subsistence farming and fishing sector.

 COMOROS
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is a legislated minimum wage, but it is barely adequate to
 cover basic human needs. However,, most workers also have access
 to some subsistence agriculture or -fishing and receive support
 from the extended family The hours of work in any one job
 rarely exceed 35 hours' per week. The Government periodically
 reminds employers to respect the Labor Code, which guarantees a
 day off per week, plus'a month of paid vacation per year, but
 does not set a maximum workweek. Overall, there are very few
 standards set by the Ministry of Labor. As there is virtually
 no manufacturing, little attention has been given to health and
 safety standards in this sector.
