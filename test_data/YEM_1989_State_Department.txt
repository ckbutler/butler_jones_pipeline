 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 The military and a core of senior, experienced technocrats
 have dominated the key sectors of government in the Yemen Arab
 Republic (YAR) since the 1962 revolution which overthrew the
 theocratic Imamate. The central Government in Sanaa continues
 to expand its authority to all parts of the country, but
 tribal leaders in isolated areas are reluctant to surrender
 their traditional prerogatives, such as tax collecting and
 mediating disputes. Tribal conflicts and blood feuds
 occasionally spill into the major cities, and tribesmen in
 rural areas often carry automatic weapons.
 Colonel Ali Abdallah Salih has been President since 1978; his
 two immediate predecessors were assassinated-within 8 months
 of each other. He was elected to a third 5-year term in July
 1988 by the new Consultative Assembly, which has specific
 oversight powers including giving or withholding confidence in
 the Prime Minister and his Cabinet. President Salih sets
 government policy and relies on. technocrats to administer the
 Government and on the military and security services to keep.
 him in power. In 1989 the Consultative Assembly played an
 increasingly assertive role, questioning ministers closely on
 expenditures and operations of their ministries. While
 meeting in Aden on November 30, President Salih and Secretary
 General al-Bidh, representing the ruling party of the
 Peoples's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY), ratified a 1981
 draft constitution for a unified Yemeni state. The two
 leaders agreed to submit the constitution.to the legislative
 authorities of the YAR and PDRY for ratification within 6
 months and then to the Yemeni people for approval in a
 referendum during the following 6 months.-
 Internal security is largely maintained by the central
 National Security Organization (NSO), whose 'gents have broad
 discretion, especially when national security matters are
 believed to be involved, to detain citizens for questioning,
 search their homes, and monitor their activities, telephone
 conversations, and correspondence.
 The YAR is a poor country with 9 million people and a
 rudimentary physical and social infrastructure.- Oil revenue
 in 1989 was expected to compensate partially for the drastic
 decline in the official remittances received from YAR
 nationals working abroad, a decline which began in 1983.
 Import controls and currency controls, imposed in 1986, remain
 in place. The economy is basically a free-market economy,
 although the Government-controls a wide array of prices,
 especially in the cities. The small size of proven oil
 reserves makes rapid development, such as the Gulf countries
 have experienced, unlikely.
 Civil liberties remain broadly restricted, with no significant
 change from previous years. Major human rights concerns
 include abuse of prisoners and detainees; arbitrary detention;
 lack of fair trial in security cases; restrictions on freedom
 of speech and press, assembly, and association; and the right
 of citizens to change their government. However, the
 Consultative Assembly's review and criticism of government
 policies and actions have led to increased public discussion
 of government policies. There is informal and some
 institutionalized discrimination against Yemeni citizens with
 a non-Yemeni parent. Tribal and traditional social customs
 tend to restrict women's role in the public side of society.

 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no confirmed reports that government forces
 executed individuals for political reasons. In a covertly
 circulated pamphlet, the underground leftist opposition group,
 the National Democratic Front (NDF), accused the Government of
 having killed 250 NDF followers since 1982, including 3
 members of the military, shot in Sanaa in December 1987, who
 were allegedly associated with the NDF. In its 1989 Report
 coverifig 1988, Amnesty International (AI) described the
 killing of ï¿½he three as "apparently politically motivated."
 b- Disappearance
 Occasionally Yemenis "disappear" as a result of being detained
 secretly by the NSO. Most of these detainees are eventually
 released.
 c- Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although the Constitution, the National Charter, and Yemeni
 law proscribe physical torture, security officials reportedly
 resort with impunity to force or the threat of force to
 extract information from detainees. Most informed Yemenis
 believe that the.NSO engages in torture on occasion. The
 Yemeni legal code is based on Islamic Shari'a law, which calls
 for such punishments as stoning for adultery; however, these
 penalties are rarely imposed. Flogging of convicted drunkards
 is occasionally administered in public. AI received reports
 in 1987 that some prisoners, including children, are manacled
 for protracted periods of time. There continue to be credible
 reports that in some cases prisoners' hands had been chained
 to their necks and ankles.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There were continuing reports of arbitrary arrests. Detainees
 were held-without charge for extended periods despite
 constitutional limits on the time police may hold a suspect
 without judicial concurrence. Persons are sometimes detained
 without charge while third parties negotiate the payment of
 tribal law fines or "blood money" by the detainee's relatives
 to the victim or victims* relatives. Established procedures
 which allow prisoners to notify relatives and lawyers are
 seldom observed, especially in cases of arrests by NSO
 officials. When foreigners are arrested, consular
 notification is late-or nonexistent.
 I  .
 The Constitution prohibits expulsion of Yemenis from the
 .country. *Political dissidents have occasionally gone into
 self-imposed-exile or accepted government positions overseas
 -to escap possible problems at home.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are three principal court systems: Shari'a, Commercial,
 and State Security. The Sharila (Islamic) courts have
 
 
 1611
 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 jurisdiction in all cases outside the domain of the other two,
 although there is some overlap in commercial law cases. The
 Sharila courts, viewed within their traditional Islamic
 context, appear to be fair and impartial. If the defendant is
 taken to trial, he is informed of the charges against him at
 the conclusion of the police investigation. The judge
 actively questions witnesses. Attorneys are allowed to
 counsel their clients but are not permitted to address the
 court or examine witnesses. Litigants in Commercial Courts
 can generally expect a fair and open trial with legal counsel,
 although tribal ties and bribery are said to play a role in
 some judicial proceedings. Defendants in the Shari'a and
 Commercial Courts enjoy the right of appeal and generally open
 court sessions. The Shari'a and Commercial Courts are largely
 independent of the executive, but all decisions, as in the
 State Security courts, are subject to presidential review and
 confirmation.
 The State Security Courts are convened by the President to try
 specific cases of espionage or other antigovernment activity.
 Rights normally afforded the accused may be suspended in
 security cases. The State Security Courts were not known to
 have convened in 1989. AI reported in 1989 that five persons
 were sentenced to death in 1985 and another in 1989 on charges
 of murder relating to alleged killings said to have taken
 place in clashes between the NDF and government forces before
 1982. Al reported the six, all believed to be members of the
 NDF, returned to the YAR in response to a mid-1982 amnesty
 said to allow all members of the NDF to return without fear of
 persecution. Al also noted lack of procedural safeguards in
 their trial.
 The number of political prisoners is difficult to estimate,
 but there are probably fewer than 50 long-term detainees.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 National security forces routinely search homes, monitor
 telephones, read personal mail, and otherwise intrude into
 private matters when national security is believed to be
 involved. Automobiles are routinely stopped and searched and
 the identification of the occupants demanded at intersection
 checkpoints throughout the country, especially at night.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Restrictions exist on free speech but are largely confined to
 the urban areas because the Government.has only limited
 control in the countryside. Some Yemenis believe that they
 may experi-ence difficulty if they are overheard criticizing
 the Government by.national security agents.
 The Information Ministry owns and operates the radio and
 television stations, as well as the major newspapers. The few
 privately owned (nondaily) newspapers do not voice views
 contrary to the Government's, nor are they permitted to
 criticize government policies or personalities. Complaints
 about government bureaucracy and the implementation of
 government policy (e.g., import and foreign-exchange controls
 and social services) are permitted.
 
 
 1612
 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 The Government removes articles from Yemeni -publications which
 its censors deem inappropriate. There is also considerable
 self-censorship. The weekly newspaper published by Muslim
 fundamentalists enjoys more independence than most
 publications, but it also refrains from direct criticism of
 senior government personalities.
 Several foreign publications, including English language
 newspapers and magazines, are available in the cities, but
 those containing material deemed offensive are withheld from
 distribution. Arabic-language newspapers and magazines
 published outside the YAR are screened for articles on Yemeni
 domestic politics, and some were not permitted to reach the
 newsstands. In the past, the Government has suspended
 publishing licenses for extended periods to punish independent
 publishers.
 Self-censorship is also practiced at Sanaa University, whose
 professors and senior administrators must receive NSO
 clearance before being hired. Most professors, including the
 many expatriates, do not complain about government
 interference in their courses or curriculum development.
 Student organizations independent of the Government are not
 permitted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although ostensibly legal, demonstrations are rare. In
 November 1988, .there were violent demonstrations in the
 southern province of Taiz in response to the killing of at
 least one civilian following an altercation with a soldier.
 Also, some Yemeni interest groups such as grape farmers
 demonstrated before the Consultative Assembly and were
 received by the Assembly chairman. Because political parties
 are illegal, the Government's view is that there can be no
 antigovernment rallies or demonstrations. Some activist
 Muslim clergymen, however, preach politics, local and
 international, under the pretext of delivering a sermon after
 Friday prayers.
 Registered organizations, such as professional groups, are
 allowed to invite outside speakers to lecture on their
 official premises so long as their speeches do not conflict
 with government policies.
 Contact between Yemenis and foreigners is selectively
 monitored by the NSO. All government ministries and major
 organizations have NSO representatives on their staffs.
 Invitations and requests for appointments from diplomats
 to senior government officials must be sent through the
 Foreign Ministry, although contacts with businessmen and
 parliamentarians are routine. Yemenf visitors to foreign
 embassiestare sometimes questioned by NSO gate guards, The
 overall effect is to discourage contact between Yemenis and
 foreigners, although nondiplomatic personnel--for example,
 officials working on aid projects--generally enjoy good access
 to their Yemeni colleagues.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the state religion and is professed by virtually all
 Yemenis. Members of the Zaydi (Shi'a) sect historically have
 
 
 1613
 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 enjoyed greater political influence than those followers of
 the Shafili (Sunni) school of jurisprudence, although this
 distinction is often more geographical and tribal than
 sectarian and is becoming blurred. The two Islamic
 communities coexist with little friction and have fewer
 doctrinal differences than do the Shi'a and Sunni communities
 in some neighboring countries. Islamic associations with ties
 to pan-Islamic organizations enjoy a degree of freedom,
 including the right to operate schools largely independent of
 the national school system. Radical Islamic revival is not a
 major force in the YAR, although the influential and
 well-organized Muslim Brotherhood campaigns for the respect of
 traditional Yemeni values.
 Civil servants swear an oath to Allah, and Consultative
 Assembly members must, according to the electoral law, be
 "good" Muslims. In practice, the "good" Muslim rule is only
 applied to Yemenis, generally leftists, whom the Government
 wants excluded on political grounds. A willingness to swear
 the oath to Allah (and to the Yemeni nation and revolution)
 normally suffices. Although the Constitution does not
 explicitly refer to equal rights for non-Muslims, it does say:
 "The State has no right to impose distinctions in human rights
 due to religion or color or sex or language or natural origin
 or profession." Accordingly, the prison code provides for
 freedom of religious practice in prisons.
 Almost all of the once substantial Yemeni Jewish population
 has emigrated to Israel, but 1,000 to 1,500 remain, mostly in
 rural areas in the north. There are no synagogues, but Jews
 are permitted to practice their religion, including religious
 instruction, in private homes. The Government makes a point
 of ensuring that no impediment to this right exists. Although
 religious materials are not published in Hebrew in the YAR for
 the small resident Jewish community, the Government has
 allowed foreign Jewish groups to distribute Hebrew-language
 religious materials and religious articles such as
 phylacteries and prayer shawls.
 There are no indigenous Christian Yemenis. Foreign
 Christians, like Jews, are permitted to conduct private
 services, but churches are not allowed. Foreign clergy are
 not allowed to proselytize, but some teach or work in social
 services.
 d. Freedom of Mlovement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Many Yemenis historically have sought employment abroad. The
 Government does not restrict emigration, partly in recognition
 of the importance to the economy of foreign remittances.
 Procedures for obtaining passports and the necessary exit
 visas are sometimes onerous, especially for Yemeni men who
 have not completed their military service. Yemeni citizens,
 whether Jews or Muslims, are not allowed to travel to Israel.
 There are no internal travel restrictions for Yemenis,
 although numerous checkpoints exist on major roads.
 Foreigners must register and receive permission to travel
 outside the capital. An American tourist was detained in 1989
 for traveling to areas outside the capital without permission.
 As the result of an agreement in 1988 between the YAR and the
 PDRY to permit citizens of each country to enter the other by
 presenting only their national identity card, the border
 between the two countries is basically open to Yemenis for
 
 
 1614
 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 the first time in the history of the acrimonious YAR-PDRY
 relationship. Many PDRY citizens have taken advantage of this
 accord to visit relatives in theYAR;-the traffic-from north
 to south continues to be relatively light.
 Of those southerners who fled after the 1986 coup in Aden,
 approximately 60,000 remain in the north. In 1989 perhaps
 as many as 5p000 southerners returned to the PDRY, while
 approximately the same number of wives and children from the
 south joined their male relatives in exile in the north.
 There are about 1,100 Eritrean refugees from Ethiopia at a
 camp near the coastal town of al-Khawkha. Several thousand
 more are scattered throughout the country. The Government
 closely monitors all political activity by the PDRY and
 Eritrean refugees. Many of the Palestinians who arrived from
 Lebanon in 1982-83 have left;-the remainder live in a camp
 near Sanaa and are closely'watched by the NSO. The movement
 and activity of the Palestinians is restricted. Palestinians
 have not assimilated into Yemeni society largely due to the
 conservative tribal nature of the society.
 Section 3 -Respect~for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to-Change Their Government
 Political parties-are banned, and in practice citizens are
 unable peacefully to change the Government. There were
 contested seats during the 1988 Consultative Assembly
 elections, but-zcandidates were not allowed openly to oppose
 the President or the .Nativnal Charter. The President has the
 final .word on all key decisions, appoints ministers, and
 chooses directly ox indirectly the members of various
 consultative bodies. In-principle, the Consultative Assembly
 could have accepted President Salih's resignation in July 1988
 and chosen to elect someone else as President. In practice
 there was little, if any, likelihood that this would happen.
 The Consultative Assembly, 128 of whose.159 members were
 elected (31 were appointed by President Salih), has the power
 to ratify government legislation and appointments and-to give
 or withhold its confidence to the-Prime Minister and the
 Cabinet.- in the 18 months since it was elected, the Assembly
 has asserted its prerogatives by having the Government amend
 its basic program to restrict aaceptance of foreign loans,
 .prohibit tax increaser, and specify.a numher of development
 projects. In. 1989 the Assembly rejected onezmajor loan which
 the Government had-strongly urged be approved. Assembly
 members subjected the Government's proposed budget figures to
 intense scrutiny andquestioning. 'The Assembly also reviewed
 internationil agreements, including Arab Cooperation Council
 agreements. The Consultative Assemibly -replaces the previous
 presidentially appointed Constituent Assembly.
 Although the Government maintains that no political opposition
 groups exist in the YAR, and-that everyone supports the
 -National Charter, there are distinct groupings-in the
 Assembly: rightists, leftists, government supporters,
 traditional tribesmen, technocrats, and Muslim
 traditionalists. Their political agendas overlap but are not
 identical. Campaigning in 1988 took the form of pamphlets,
 posters, and rallies; criticism of rival candidates was not
 permitted. The actual polling was orderly, and vote counting,
 by all accounts, was honest.
 
 
 1615
 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government permitted one international organization, the
 International Committee of the Red Cross, to investigate
 prison conditions in 1989. Otherwise, the Government has
 generally not permitted organized groups to investigate local
 cases of possible human rights violations. However, in its
 1989 Report, covering 1988, AI noted that it had addressed
 appeals on behalf of political prisoners and raised other
 matters with the YAR Government, and that it had "received
 regular responses."
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Jews usually live in relative harmony with their Muslim
 neighbors. While there have been reports that Yemeni Jews are
 unfairly treated, persecuted, and eager to emigrate to Israel,
 there has been no confirmation of discriminatory actions by
 the Government directed against Yemeni Jews, and there were no
 reports in 1989 of incidents involving government-inspired or
 condoned harassment. Violent incidents do occur periodically,
 however, especially in the countryside. The Government makes
 consistent efforts to protect the largely rural, isolated
 Jewish community, both at the local level and, when necessary,
 through the intervention of senior officials in Sanaa. Still,
 government control over areas where the Jews live is by no
 means complete, and disputes must often be resolved within the
 framework of the existing tribal structure. Jews in tribal
 areas are disadvantaged in that they cannot rely on the threat
 of tribal retribution to deter attacks. Jews travel freely
 within Yemen. A few Jews recently traveled abroad to Arab
 countries for medical treatment. Travelers to the YAR have
 been able to meet with members of the Jewish community.
 A substantial number of Yemeni citizens with a non-Yemeni
 parent do not enjoy the full range of their constitutional
 rights. These people, known as muwallidin, face both
 institutionalized and informal discrimination. For example,
 Sanaa University, which is administered by the Government,
 advertises openings for teaching and senior administrativa
 positions with the stipulation that both parents of applicants
 must be Yemeni citizens. The same is true for applicants to
 the YAR's military academy. The two-Yemeni parent rule is not
 strictly enforced at Sanaa University, however.
 Discrimination against muwallidin is not universal or
 pervasive. Many senior government officials and at least one
 minister are muwallidin. There is no information that
 muwallidin are arbitrarily arrested or imprisoned. Although
 some muwallidin have their status indicated in their Yemeni
 passports, there are no known travel'restrictions against them.
 Restrictions on women are largely imposed by culture and
 tradition rather than law. In 1988 the Government ratified a
 1981 International Labor Organization (ILO) agreement
 mandating equality of opportunity and treatment in the
 workplace for men and women. The Government publicly opposed
 the efforts of some conservative tribal leaders and Muslim
 traditionalists to prevent women from registering to vote in
 the July 1988 elections; government media reiterated the
 constitutional right of women to participate in the
 elections. On the other hand, five women who applied to the
 
 
 1616
 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 electoral commission for certification as candidates were
 pressured by the Government to withdraw their applications to
 appease Muslim traditionalists, and they did so.
 Women now work in the midlevels of several ministries and also
 in banks and other businesses. Yemen's largest factory group
 employs women on the same pay scale as men, and women there
 have risen through the ranks to lower management positions.
 This same group, however, has a policy of only employing
 single or divorced women; in principle, the group would accept
 a written statement of nonobjection from the husband of a
 married woman, but reportedly none has ever been presented.
 Women may own property.
 Societal pressures often force women to defer to the guidance
 of male colleagues and the general supervision of male
 relatives. Women seeking exit visas are frequently asked to
 demonstrate that male relatives pose no objections to their
 travel. Education for women in significant numbers began only
 at the end of the civil war in 1970. The literacy rate for
 women is approximately 2 percenti but the Government is trying
 to expand their educational opportunities, including at the
 university level where about 20 percent of the students are
 female. However, staffing shortages and other problems
 continue to hinder the development of education in general.
 Societal pressures, especially in the rural areas, as well as
 the demand for their labor, frequently limit the opportunities
 of women for education.
 A form of female genital mutilation, clitorectomy, is
 practiced in the coastal region of the YAR (the Tihama),
 especially among Yemenis of African origin. The extent of the
 practice of clitorectomy is unknown. While some individual
 government health workers in the Tihama actively discourage
 clitorectomy, there is no government directive or guidance
 against the practice. Cqnservative social mores prevent
 public discussion or government acknowledgment of this
 practice. Wife beating and other physical abuse of women
 occasionally occurs in Yemeni families, but again it is a
 subject rarely discussed. In cases of abuse, the woman victim
 usually seeks recourse to her male relatives to pressure the
 perpetrator to stop the abuse. The victimized woman can seek
 a legal remedy in court, but social traditions usually impel
 women and their male relatives to seek mediation to stop the
 abuse. If mediation or outside pressure fails, the victimized
 woman may return and live with her male relatives.
 YAR family law is dominated by tribal customs and local
 traditions influenced and modified by Islpmic (Shari'a) law.
 Polygamy is allowed under Islamic law and occasionally
 practiced in the YAR. The institution of dowry payments,
 whether the Islamic "mahr" paid by the husband to the wife
 upon divorce or tribal customary payments made by the groom to
 the bride's family or to the bride, is widespread. The amount
 of payments is steadily increasing in spite of government
 attempts to limit the amount. Divorce is common, as is
 remarriage.
 A government-sponsored women's association exists to promote
 female education and civic responsibilities.

 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Under the YAR labor code, a union may be set up by 100 or more
 workers upon application to and approval by the government
 authorities. The labor code prescribes a single union system
 with one union committee per enterprise, one union branch per
 locality, one general union per economic sector, and one
 national umbrella organization, which is the Yemeni Trade
 Union Confederation. Government employees and some categories
 of farm workers are excluded from union membership. According
 to the labor code, unions are prohibited from engaging in any
 political activity, and their financial records are subject to
 government oversight. Trade unions are reported to be under
 heavy NSO influence and have not been known to challenge the
 Government.
 Labor-related legislation neither allows nor disallows
 strikes, but union-sanctioned strikes do not occur. There
 have been occasional wildcat strikes, but no reports of
 government or employer harassment of wildcat strikers or their
 leaders and no prosecutions.
 The Yemeni Trade Union Confederation is affiliated with the
 International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and the
 Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions. The
 YAR ratified the ILO's Convention 87 on Freedom of Association
 and Convention 98 on Collective Bargaining in 1976.
 In 1989, as in previous years, the ILO Committee of Experts
 extensively criticized numerous provisions of the labor code
 which conflicted with the requirements of Conventions 87 and
 98. However, the ILO Committee noted the Government's current
 efforts to amend the labor code to bring it into conformity
 with international conventions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Although the YAR labor code calls on employers to treat
 workers correctly, it does not contain provisions to ensure
 worker protection against acts of discrimination by employers,
 nor does it provide a legal framework for a free collective
 bargaining system. There is no bargaining, and there are no
 collective agreements in force. There is no export processing
 zone in the YAR.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There are no reports of forced or compulsory labor, which is
 forbidden by the YAR Constitution.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There is no minimum age for employment of children, but
 compulsory education requirements, when enforced, would have
 the same effect. In general, however, these requirements are
 ignored. Child labor, sanctioned by family custom, is
 common. Labor by minors aged 12 to 14 is regulated, however,
 by the Labor Code.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Labor
 The rights of workers are enunciated by law, but labor
 regulations are not strictly enforced. The Ministry of Labor,
 
 
 1618
 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 upon a formal complaint by a worker of an employer violation
 of the labor code, investigates the complaint and seeks
 restitution for the worker from the employer if the complaint
 is found valid. Enforcement of the labor code is more
 prevalent against employers of large numbers of expatriate
 workers and against foreign employers of Yemeni workers.
 Hiring often depends on family and tribal connections and
 there is no minimum wage. The prevailing daily wage for
 unskilled workers is about $15, which allows a very modest
 standard of living for a worker with a family. YAR legal
 codes prescribe a maximum 8-hour workday (6 during Ramadan),
 but some workshops operate 10- or 12-hour shifts without
 penalty.
 Local production is largely based on agriculture and cottage
 industries. While working conditions are sometimes harsh,
 consistent with the prevailing subsistence economy,
 the Government has set general safety requirements for larger
 concerns and occasionally checks to see if they are being
 observed.
