 URUGUAY
 Uruguay is a constitutional republic with an elected president, a bicameral legis-
 lature and an independent judicial branch. In November 1994, former President
 Julio Maria Sanguinetti won a narrow election victory. He began his 5-year term
 in March 1995.
 The Interior Ministry administers the country's police departments and the prison
 system and is responsible for domestic security and public safety. The police contin-
 ued to commit human rights abuses.
 The economy is a mixture of private and state enterprises and is heavily depend-
 ent on agricultural exports and agroindustry. The Government respects private
 property rights. The economy contracted 2.4 percent in 1995, but estimated growth
 or 1996 was 1.0 percent. Annual per capita income was about $5,767 in 1995.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law
 and judiciary generally provide effective means of dealing with instances of individ-
 ual abuse. However, there were problems in some areas, principally continued police
 abuse and mistreatment of detainees, and poor prison conditions. Low pay and con-
 sequent lack of professionalism in police ranks continue to be a problem. Court
 cases sometimes last many years, resulting in lengthy pretrial detention. Other
 problems include continued societal discrimination against women and the black mi-
 nority, violence against women, and one case of abridgment of freedom of the press.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 An earlier case resurfaced in June when the authorities identified a body, discov-
 ered in 1995 buried at a beach resort, as that of Eugenio Berrios, a Chilean chemist.
 He had disappeared from Chile in 1992 after he was called to testify concerning the
 assassination of former Chilean Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier. Berrios report-
 edly entered Uruguay illegally under protective military custody. He was last seen
 alive on November 15, 1992, when he showed up at a Canelones police station
 claiming that he had escaped from his captors. The police claimed that they re-
 turned Berrios to the custody of military officers. The Canelones chief of police de-
 stroyed the police station records and later had to resign because of that action. The
 Ministry of Interior conducted an internal investigation and determined that Berrios
 left for Brazil the day after the incident. The case was ignored until August 1995,
 when the p residents of ruguay and Chile both agreed that the matter would be
 placed in the hands of the Uruguayan court, thus reopening the case.
 b. Disappearance.-Ther were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 There were substantial calls for investigation into past disappearances, despite
 the 1985 amnesty which was confirmed by a 1989 plebiscite. in April a Senator
 whose father was tortured and killed in Argentina in 1976 called on the Govern-
 ment to investigate the fate of those who had disappeared in Uruguay. Also in April,
 a former navy officer acknowledged to the press that he had 'acted inhumanely" but
 asserted that had not killed anyone nor known about the fate of those who had dis-
 appeared. He said that he assumed full responsibility and called on others to do the
 same. This was followed in May by a silent march in honor of the disappeared per-
 sons in which 50,000 people participated.
 The press and a number of opposition political leaders called for an official inves-
 tigation under the Amnesty Law, which obliges the executive branch to investigate
 cases of citizens who were detained and then disappeared. The Government and the
 traditional parties supported the military's insistence that there be no investigation
 and argued that the 1989 plebiscite resolved the issue. Since the return to democ-
 racy, three administrations have consistently refused to open official investigations
 into the fate of those who disappeared under the military regime.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits brutal treatment of prisoners, but the police continued
 to commit abuses. The Ministry of Interior did not receive any accusations of pris-
 oner abuse or torture under the Sanguinetti administration, which replaced al the
 prison authorities.
 The judicial and parliamentary branches of government are responsible for inves-
 tigating specific allegations of abuse. A recently formed internal police investigative
 unit, staffed by attorneys, receives complaints from any person concerning possible
 noncriminal police abuse of power. While the courts seldom convicted and punished
 law enforcement officials for such abuse in the past, such prosecutions are occurring
 more frequently: For e xample, a tribunal upheld the prosecution of four police offi-
 
 
 573
 cers (who were disciplined but not sent to prison) involved in the August 1994 Filtro
 hospital demonstrations in which police killed 1 person and injured 50. The court
 stated that the police had committed excesses and that their use of firearms was
 not justified. In a separate case, a court convicted and sent to prison two officers
 accused of robbing a bill collector.
 Police officers charged with less serious crimes may continue on active duty; those
 charged with more serious crimes are separated from active service until the court
 resolves their cases. A Ministry of Interior report stated that 440 police officers on
 active duty had a prior criminal record; of those, 232 had committed crimes while
 on duty. The 1995 Public Security Law, now completely implemented, requires a
 proportional use of force by the police and the use of weapons only as a last resort,
 in accordance with United Nations codes regarding the use of force.
 Conditions in prisons end juvenile detention facilities remain poor but not life
 threatening. As part of the new Pubic Security Law, a ommission formed to study
 prison onditions end update legislation on penal institutions to bring them into
 compliance with international standards presented its report to the Government in
 June. It criticized the treatment of prisoners as contrary to minimal U.N. standards;
 cited overcrowding, lack of staff training, corruption, and physical violence as prob-
 lems; and recommended the immediate closure of seven pena institutions.
 The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution requires the police to
 have a written warrant issued by a judge before making an arrest. The only excep-
 tion is when the police apprehend the accused during commission of a crime. The
 Constitution also provides the accused with the right to a judicial determination of
 the legality of detention and requires that the detaining authority explain the legal
 grounds for the detention. Police may hold a detainee incommunicado for 24 hours
 efore presenting the case to a judge, at which time the detainee has the right to
 counsel. It is during this 24-hour period that police sometimes abuse prisoners, occa-
 sionally resulting in forced confessions.
 A 1980 law stipulates that police confessions obtained before a prisoner appears
 before a judge end attorney (without the police present) have no validity. Further,
 should a prisoner claim that he has been mistreated, by law the judge must inves-
 afford a lawyer, the courts appoint a public defender. If the
 crime carries a pnalty of at least 2 ears in prison, the accused person is confined
 during the judge's investigation of the charges unless the authorities agree to re-
 lease the person on bal. This seldom happens. As a result, a pproximately 93 per-
 cent of allpersons currently incarcerated are awaiting a final decision in their case.
 Because   ?the slowness of the judicial process, the ength of time prisoners spend
 in jail before being sentenced may exceed the maximum sentence for their crime.
 Human rights groups claim that the uncertainty as to how long one will be impris-
 oned is a factor creating tension within the country's prisons.
 The Government does not use forced exile as a means of punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial .-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice.
 Supreme Court heads the judiciary system and supervises the work of the
 lower courts. A parallel military court system operates under a Military Justice
 Code. Two military justices sit on the Supreme Court but participate only in cases
 involving the military. Military justice applies to civilians only during a state of war
 or insurrection.
 Trial proceedings are usually based on written arguments to the judge, which are
 not routinely made public. Only the prosecutor and defense attorney have access to
 all documents that form part of the written record. The courts introduced oral argu-
 ment in 1990, but individual judges use it at their option. Most judges choose to
 retain the written method, a major factor slowing down the judicial process. There
 is no legal provision against self-incrimination, and judges may compel defendants
 to answer any question they pose. The defense attorney or prosecutor may appeal
 convictions to a higher court, which may acquit the person of the crime, confirm the
 conviction, or reduce or increase the sentence.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the right to privacy, and the Government generally re-
 spects constitutional provisions and safeguards in practice.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, but the authorities may abridge these rights if persons are deemed
 to be inciting violence or "insulting the nation.
 
 
 574
 All elements of the political spectrum freely express their viewpoints in both print
 and broadcast media. Montevideo alone has 8 daily newspapers and 6 important
 weeklies; there are also approximately 100 other weekly and a few daily newspapers
 throughout the country. Montevideo has one government-affiliated and three com-
 mercial television stations. There are about 110 radio stations and 20 television sta-
 tions in the country.
 A 1989 law stipulates that expression and communication of thoughts and opin-
 ions are free, within the limits contained in the Constitution, and it outlines meth-
 ods of responding to "inexact or aggravating information." The law calls for 3
 months' to 2 years' imprisonment for "knowingly divulginq false news that causes
 a grave disturbance to the public peace or a grave prejudice to economic interests
 of the State" or for "insulting the nation, the State, or their powers." The authorities
 use this law intermittently to set and enforce certain limits on freedom of the press.
 The Government closed a radio station after an August 1994 riot; it remains
 closed, and the authorities never brought specific charges against the station or its
 owners.
 In May a court sentenced the director and the editor of a leftist daily to 2 years
 in prison on charges of offending the honor of a head of state (the President of Para-
 guay). The judge based the sentence on the national press law and the Constitution
 rather than on whether or not the information in the newspaper was correct. The
 two were later conditionally released from jail, but the case is still pending. The sen-
 tence drew the attention and criticism of human rights groups around the world.
 In October a judge rejected another case involving a libel suit filed by a former
 president, on the grounds that freedom of the press was an essential pillar and in-
 dispensable condition of democracy.
 A June decree requires the Government's prior authorization for the import of
 newsprint. The Inter-American Press Association urged the Government to repeal
 this decree, calling it a "serious threat to the preservation of freedom of the press,"
 inasmuch as it stipulates prior government authorization and grants the power to
 establish quotas.
 The national university is autonomous, and the authorities generally respect aca-
 demic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice.
 The Government grants refugee status in accordance with the 1951 U.N. Conven-
 tion Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1961 Protocol. The Government
 gants asylum only for political crimes as set forth in the 1928 Treaty of Havana,
 the 1889 Treaty of Montevideo, and the 1954 Caracas Convention. The Government
 cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The issue of the provision
 of first asylum did not arise in 1996. There were no reports of forced return of per-
 sons to a country where they feared persecution.
 In December an appellate court decided not to extradite to Peru two members of
 the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) and released them from cus-
 tody. The two then applied to the UNHCR for refugee status. At year's end, the
 UNHCR had not determined if the two MRTA members met the conditions for such
 status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right and ability peacefully to change their government. Uru-
 guay is a multiparty democracy with mandatory universal suffrage for those 18
 years of age or older, and there are no restrictions regarding race, sex, religion, or
 economic status. The Colorado party, the National (Blanco) party, the Broad Front
 coalition, and the New Space party are the four major political groupings.
 A constitutional reform approved by plebiscite on December 8 did away with the
 old "law of lemas," by which a party could run multiple presidential and legislative
 candidates for the same offices. The candidate receiving the most votes from the
 party receiving the most votes filled the presidency, and each party gained seats in
 the Senate and Chamber of Deputies according to the percentage of votes that it
 received. The reform limits parties to one candidate, determined by internal party
 primaries, per elected office. The top two presidential candidates face a runol elec-
 tion if no one wins a first-round majority vote.

 Women and blacks face impediments to high-level participation in politics and
 employment in government. Only 1 of 12 cabinet ministers is a woman. In the legis-
 lature that was installed in February 1995, 2 of 30 Senators are women (the first
 since 1973), and 8 of 99 Deputies are women. There are no minority representatives
 or cabinet officials.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and the law prohibit discrimination based on race, sex, religion,
 or disability. Despite these provisions, discrimination against some grups exists.
 Women.-Violence against women continues to be a serious problem. There were
 more than 400 reported cases of family violence, reflecting both an increased public
 awareness of the problem as well as a growing change in attitude among women.
 Previously, a woman's ability to file and sustain a complaint was hampered by the
 legal requirement to show lesions. The new Public Security Law provides for sen-
 tences of 6 months to 2 years in prison for a person found guilty of committing an
 act of violence or of making continuing threats to cause bodily injury to persons re-
 lated emotionally or legally to the perpetrator. The Montevideo city ha has a hot
 line for victims of violence.
 The Government has established an office of assistance for victims of domestic vi-
 olence which trains police how to receive complaints of violence against women. The
 Government also asked the United Nations to resume a project, begun in 1990 but
 abandoned for lack of funds, designed to train judges, police, and prison officials
 how to handle crimes against women.
 Women enjoy equality under the law but face discrimination stemming from tradi-
 tional attitudes and practices. The work force exhibits segregation by gender.
 Women, who make up almost one-half the work force, tend to be concentrated in
 lower payng jobs. However, one-half the students now entering universities are
 women. They often pursue professional careers but are underrepresented in tradi-
 tionally male-dominated professions. Human rights groups have criticized the Gov-
 ernment because it still has not implemented a 1989 law for equality in the work-
 p lace. The Liceo Militar, a military-run secondary school that prepares officer-can-
 ddates for all the services, admitted 110 women, an indication of the military's
 movement toward integrating women into the military officer corps.
 A small institute in the Ministry of Education coordinates government programs
 for women. There are a number of active women's rights groups, and many of their
 activities in 1996 centered on followup to the platform of action of the 1995 U.N.
 Conference on Women.
 Children.-The Government is generally committed to protecting children's rights
 and welfare. An institute in the Ministry of Interior oversees implementation of the
 Government's programs for children but receives only limited funding for programs.
 The Government regards the education and health of children as a top priority and
 believes it should do more to ensure free education and proper health care for all
 children. Since 40 percent of children under the age of 5 live in 20 percent of the
 poorest homes, the Government is attempting to extend proper health and education
 to them with the help of the United Nations Children's Fund.
 There are no societal patterns of abuse of children. Minors under the age of 18
 are not subject to criminal trial, but receive special treatment with special judges
 and, when sentenced, stay in institutions run by the National Institute for Minors
 (INAME) for the set period determined by the judge. The Government currently
 houses all its problem minors in INAME. The most controversial aspect of the 1995
 Public Security Law would allow the Government to put minors with a record of
 violent crimes in adult prisons if INAME has no room in its own institutions. Even
 though the law stipulates that minors would occupy separate facilities within the
 prisons, human rights groups adamantly oppose this provision. As a result, INAME
 has decided that it will not send minors to adult prisons.
 People With Disabilities.-The legislature passed a law covering the rights of the
 disabled in 1989. A national disabilities commission oversees implementation of the
 law. Although the law mandates accessibility only to new buildings or public serv-
 ices for people with disabilities, the Government is providing access to a number of
 existing buildings. The law reserves 4 percent of public sector jobs for the disabled.
 
 
 576
 
 In general the country has an excellent mental health system and an interest in
 the rights of people with mental disabilities. Nevertheless, a 1995 study of mental
 health institutions found that conditions violated a broad range of rights codified
 in United Nations principles for the protection of persons with mental disabilities.
 It found that treatment was limited almost exclusively to psychotropic medication
 and electroconvulsive therapy; commitment could occur with a vague diagnosis of
 'mentally ill;" there were no practical limitations on the length of commitments;
 once admitted, patients often found it very difficult to get released; there was little
 or no psychotherapy, rehabilitation, or vocational training; and there was little or
 no respect for the dignity or privacy of residents.
 Nat wnalIRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-The ounty's black minority, estimated at 6
 percent of the population, continues to face societal discrimination. The Government
 lacks adequate statistics on blacks, which contributes to a lack of awareness that
 problems exist. The latest report (1993) put the number of black university grad-
 uates at 65, and black professionals at fewer than 50. Blacks are practically unrep-
 resented in the bureaucratic, political, and academic sectors of society. They lack the
 social and political connections necessary for entry into these groups. In a February
 1995 public opinion poll, more than three-quarters of the persons interviewed admit-
 ted that racial prejudice existed, and two-thirds of them named blacks as the group
 that faced most discrimination. The Government is working with local minority or-
 ganizations to address this problem and invited the leadingblack minority organiza-
 tion to help prepare an official report on racial discrimination.
 A broader concern expressed by minority groups is that the high level of unem-
 p loyment in other neighboring ountries will prompt increased migration of workers
 from one country to another, giving rise to discrimination against blacks.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution states that laws should promote
 the organization of trade unions and the creation of arbitration bodies. In spite of
 this provision, there is almost no legislation concerning union activities. Unions tra-
 ditionally organize and operate free of government regulation. Civil servants, em-
 ployees of state-run enterprises, and private enterprise workers may join unions. An
 estimated 12 percent of the work force is unionized. Labor unions are independent
 of political party control but have traditionally associated more closely with the
 Broad Front, the leftist political coalition.
 The Constitution provides workers with the right to strike, and there were numer-
 ous strikes during the year. The Government may legally compel workers to work
 during a strike if they perform an essential service which, if interrupted, "could
 cause a grave prejudice or risk, provoking suffering to part or all of the society."
 There are mechanisms for resolving workers' complaints against employers, but
 unions complain that these mechanisms are sometimes applied arbitrarily. The law
 generally prohibits discriminatory acts by employers, including arbitrary dismissals
 for union activity. Unions maintain that organizers are dismissed for other fab-
 ricated reasons, thus avoiding penalty under the law.
 There are no restrictions on the right of unions to form confederations or to affili-
 ate with international trade union groups; however, the one national confederation
 has chosen not to afffliat officially with any of the world federations. Some individ-
 ual unions are affiliated with international trade secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining between
 companies and their unions determines a number of private sector salaries. The ex-
 ecutive branch, acting independently, determines public sector salaries. There are
 no laws prohibiting antiunion discrimination, but a 1993 executive decree estab-
 lished fines for employers engaging in antiunion activities. The law does not require
 employers to reinstate workers fired for union activities. However, in cases of legal
 challenges by union activists, courts tend to impose indemnization levels that are
 higher than those normally paid to dismissed workers.
 
 
 Union members continued to file claims of discrimination with the Ministry of
 Labor, which has a labor commission that investigates all claims. In some of the
 cases, employers agreed to reinstate workers, but other cases remained unresolved
 at year's end.
 All labor legislation fMly covers workers employed in special export zones. There
 are no unions in any of these zones, but the few workers in these zones are not in
 traditionally organizable occupations. Because of the protected status given many of
 the companies in the free zones and the lack of union presence, occasionally compa-
 nies will implement labor practices in violation of the law.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and there is no evidence of its existence.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Child Labor Code protects
 children; the Ministry of Labor and Social Security is responsible for enforcing the
 laws. Illegal child labor is not a problem. The law generally does not permit children
 under 15 years of age to work, but 12-yearolds may work if they have a special
 permit. Children under the age of 18 may not perform dangerous, fatiguing, or night
 work. Controls over salaries and hours for children are more strict than those for
 adults. Children over the age of 16 may sue in court for payment of wages, and chil-
 dren have the legal right to dispose of their own income. However, many children
 work as street vendors in the expanding informal sector or in the agrarian sector,
 which are generally less strictly regulated and where pay is lower.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Wor.-The Ministry of Labor effectively enforces a
 legislated minimum monthly wage which is in effect in both the public and private
 sectors. The Ministry adjusts the minimum wage whenever it adjusts public sector
 wages, usually once every 4 months. The minimum wage, which was about $95 (793
 pesos) per month, functions more as an index for calculating wage rates than as a
 true measure of minimum subsistence levels, and it would not provide a decent
 standard of living for a worker and family.
 The standard workweek is 48 hours in industry and 44 hours in commerce, with
 a 36-hour break each week. The law stipulates that industrial workers receive over-
 time compensation for work in excess of 48 hours and that workers are entitled to
 20 days of paid vacation after a year of employment.
 The Ministry of Labor and Social Security enforces legislation regulating health
 and safety conditions in a generally effective manner. However, some of the regula-
 tions cover urban industrial workers more adequately than rural and agricultural
 workers. Workers have the right to remove themselves from what they consider haz-
 ardous or dangerous conditions.
