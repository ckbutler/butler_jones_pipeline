 SOUTHERN RHODESIA (ZIMBABWE)
 
 The year 1979 in Southern Rhodesia (also referred to as
 Rhodesia) witnessed two major changes in that country's
 political, legal, and social framework. In May the white-
 dominated regime of Ian Smith was supplanted by the majority
 rule government of Bishop Abel Muzorewa; and in December
 Muzorewa yielded to the return of British colonial authority.
 With each of these shifts came a new constitution and a new
 human rights environment. As a result the bulk of this
 report reflects conditions in Southern Rhodesia during the
 first eleven months of 1979. With the reasSertion of
 British authority, human rights conditions are in the
 process of transition.
 On December 21, 1979 the British Government reached formal
 agreement with the major Rhodesian parties at the Lancaster
 House conference on a peaceful solution to the Rhodesian
 conflict. The British government temporarily resumed
 authority in Rhodesia in order to implement a shbrt transi-
 tion leading to independence for the state of "Zimbabwe".
 At the end of the transition period, the people of Zimbabwe
 will elect a new government, which will take power on the
 basis of a new constitution which guarantees both majority
 rule and the protection of human rights.
 On June 1, 1979, a new constitution, including a declaration
 of rights, was promulgated in "Zimbabwe Rhodesia" (the name
 given the territory by the 1979 constitution). The adminis-
 tration of Bishop Abel Muzorewa followed the white-controlled
 regime led by former Prime Minister Ian Smith, which had
 unilaterally declared its independence from Great Britain
 in 1965. These developments were perceived by some of the
 international community as an important step toward majority
 rule, but falling short of that goal in that (a) significant
 elements of white minority control remained by virtue of
 entrenched constitutional provisions and (b) major political
 parties were banned and were not free to patticipate in
 elections. No foreign government with the exception of
 South Africa recognized or established diplomatic relations
 with the Muzorewa administration.
 Throughout 1979 a bitter war continued in much of the
 country. "Zimbabwe Rhodesian" security forces, which
 included auxiliary elements gs well as conventional military
 units, opposed the guerrilla forces of Joshua Nkomo's
 Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) and Robert Mugabe's
 Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU). The war was frequent-
 ly used to justify extreme measures, and atrocities were
 perpetrated by all sides. A cease-fire officially commenced
 on January 4, 1980, although incidents of vtolence continued..
 In one of its first acts, the Muzorewa administration
 renewed the state of emergency that had been in effect
 since the late 1960's. *In September 1979 it extended
 martial law to 90 percent of the country. In areas under
 martial law, military tribunals, known as special courts
 martial, had jurisdiction to try any person for offenses
 relating to'terrorism or the public order and to impose
 sentence, including the death penalty. In late December
 British Governor Lord Christopher Soames ordered these
 tribunals to cease operations.

 The 1979 constitution included a declaration of rights
 containing clauses concerning the right to life and per-
 sonal liberty, freedom of conscience, expression, assembly
 and association, movement, protection from slavery
 and forced labor, inhumane treatment, deprivation of
 property and arbitrary search or entry. These provisions
 contained numerous and significant exceptions. Further,
 the declaration provided that, during a period of public
 emergency, all of these guarantees could be abrogated by
 the authorities. The constitution also provided that laws
 in effect before June 1, 1979, (some of which contained
 racially discriminatory clauses) could not be found in
 contravention of the declaration for a period of ten
 years.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.    Torture
 Torture was specifically prohibited by the declaration of
 rights in the 1979 constitution. However, the torture
 provision of the declaration contained exceptions for
 "treatment reasonably justifiable" to prevent escape and
 for acts done under the authority of written law which
 would have been lawful prior to the constitution. There
 have been numerous allegations (the latest in the 1979
 Amnesty International Annual Report) that torture was
 employed extensively by military or police officials
 during the course of interrogations. Guerrilla forces
 were also frequently charged with having employed torture
 and other inhumane treatment -- including summary execu-
 tions -- in order to procure information or intimidate
 elements of the local population. Security force personnel
 and auxiliaries reportedly were tried for assaults on'
 civilians and, in some cases, disciplined.
 b. . Cruel, Inhumane, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Conditions of imprisonment could not, by definition of the
 1979 constitution, be considered degrading if "reasonably
 justifiable in the circumstances of the case..." Overcrowd-
 ing of prisons and detention centers was reportedly endemic.
 Military courts martial had the power to order executions
 without appeal and with only military review. Few reliable
 estimates on the number of martial law hangings exist since
 proceedings and sentences were considered military secrets.
 The ICRC believes that approximately 20 persons were hanged
 between January and June 1979; it is unclear if subsequent
 executions were carried out. A court martial could impose
 the death sentence for virtually any "terrorism"- related
 offence, including possession of a weapon. In early summer
 1979 the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace in
 Rhodesia spearheaded a successful legal and political drive
 to require Presidential approval before martial law execu-
 tions could be carried out. Persons "restricted", i.e.,
 detained without charge or notice in areas under martial
 law, were allowed contact with family or attorneys only on
 an exceptional basis. In one of his first acts after
 assuming authority in Southern Rhodesia, British Governor
 Lord Christopher Soames ordered an immediate ban on execu-
 tions and commuted the death sentences of eleven Africans.

 c.    Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 There were four categories of arrests and imprisonment
 in "Zimbabwe Rhodesia" before the British resumption of
 authority, with treatment and rights of the individual
 varying accordingly. Common criminals were tried publicly,
 had recourse to legal advice, and were generally treated in
 accordance with accepted legal norms. Persons accused of
 political crimes, which could include terrorism if the
 offence was committed in a non-martial law area or if
 the special court martial waived jurisdiction, were tried
 in civilian courts and had access to legal advice. Most
 trials were, however, held in camera. Estimates of the
 number of convicted political prisoners varied considerably
 and were subject to different definitions: 250 were acknow-
 ledged by the government in January 1979; Amnesty Interna-
 tional reported 1500 (October 1979); the Catholic Commis-
 sion estimated 2000 (September 1979); and the ICRC believed
 that one-half of the 1200 prisoners serving sentences after
 trial had been convicted of "political" offences. The
 International Defense and Aid Fund (IDAF) issued a report
 in September, 1979 which listed the names of 1851 persons
 it described as political prisoners.
 On November 23 Bishop Muzorewa announced that most political
 prisoners would be released "within several days". The
 Lancaster House agreement required that all political
 prisoners held by both sides were to be released. As of
 January 4, 1980, approximately 17 prisoners in this category
 remained detained in Rhodesia. However, these cases were
 being reviewed by British authorities at that time.
 A third category was "preventive detention", whereby a
 person could be held without charge for up to 14 days;
 further detention required approval from the Minister of
 Law and Order. The Muzorewa administration released 700
 detainees in early 1979, 200 shortly before it was
 installed on June 1, 1979 and approximately 130 in late
 November, 1979. According to Muzorewa, approximately 19
 remained in custody at that time.
 Several thousand individuals (the ICRC estimated 12-15,000
 while some sources placed the figure in excess of 17,000)
 were held by government security forces without warrant.
 Under the provisions of martial law, a person could be
 detained indefinitely without trial or public notification
 on the order of a military officer above the rank of major.
 No appeal was permitted. Martial law remained in effect
 as of January 4, 1980. Some detainees had been released.
 The British authorities indicated that more detainees would
 be freed and that martial law would be lifted after a
 positive assessment of the progress of the cease-fire.
 d.    Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Persons being tried for criminal offences by civilian
 courts had recourse to legal advice. Appeal procedures and
 accepted legal norms were generally followed. (Cases invol-
 ving currency violations, etc. were sometimes held in cam-
 era.) The right to a public trial was frequently d-ied
 p--litical prisoners in civilian trials. Those persons
 falling under the purview of the military courts martial
 were not entitled to legal representation, and reportedly
 had to gain the court's permission to call witnesses on
 their behalf. If convicted, the individual could be
 detained indefinitely without appeal and the only review,
 except in capital cases, was by another military tribunal.
 
 
 151
 These tribunals ceased operation in late 1979 by order of
 the British Governor.
 e.    Invasion of the Home
 Although arbitrary search or entry was prohibited by the
 declaration of rights in the 1979 constitution, the excep-
 tions provided were so broad that the prohibition was
 substantially undermined. No law or action could, according
 to the constitution, be deemed in violation of the prohibi-
 tion if it were in the "interests of defence, public
 safety, public order..." In martial law areas, 90% of the
 country, security forces personnel had unfettered authority
 to enter any building or home, and frequently exercised
 this authority.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care,
 and Education
 Although Zimbabwe Rhodesia enjoyed the benefits of a
 relatively efficient capitalist economy with constitutional
 protection for private property, economic conditions in the
 country were significantly affected by the civil war.
 Military call-ups of white males caused serious dislocations
 in the basically white-run economic sector which was
 already heavily burdened by the costs of the war, interna-
 tional sanctions, and a cut-off from world capital markets.
 According to calculations by the University of Rhodesia,
 the "poverty datum line" for a black family living in
 Salisbury was Rh dollars 114 (US $ 170) per month in
 September 1978; and perhaps only a slim majority of the
 country's urban-dwelling black workers earned cash wages
 above that level.
 Among the major effects of the war was the severe weakening
 of the infrastructure in many rural areas. Most schools
 outside the protected villages were closed. (One official
 estimate put the total of closed schools at over 1200.)
 Free public education was available to all citizens. How-
 ever, the cost of attending the better public elementary
 and secondary schools was high, effectively limiting
 attendance by a large segment of the African community.
 Also, many predominantly white public schools were becoming
 quasi-private "community schools" which, in the future, could
 choose to limit the number of blacks in their enrollment.
 Clinics and other services operated before the cease-fire
 with diminished efficiency, and only at great risk to their
 personnel. Many rural dwellers sought refuge in urban
 areas still under full government control and relatively
 free from conflict. The ICRC and church groups estimated
 that nearly 500,000 people have fled to the cities, predomi-
 nantly Salisbury, where their numbers have overwhelmed
 shelter and health facilities. An equal number are estimated
 to be in protected villages, also under crowded conditions.
 In various areas of the country, food shortages and epidemics
 remained possibilities.

 3.    Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing
 a.    Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion, and
 Assembly
 The 1979 constitution included provisions for the protection
 of the rights of free expression (speech and press), con-
 science (religion), and assembly. But these provisions
 contained broad exceptions, which severely limited these
 rights. Censorship was more or less complete as it affected
 the security situation. TV and radio were government con-
 trolled, and the press, while privately owned, was closely
 regulated. Newspapers were closed because of their opposi-
 tion to the government.  (Three such newspapers were
 permitted to begin publishing once again in early January
 after the British assumption of authority.) Political
 activity by political parties declared illegal, including
 ZAPU and ZANU, was prohibited. However, following the
 December 21 signing of the Lancaster House accords, the new
 British Governor lifted the bans on the ZANU and ZAPU
 branches of the Patriotic Front. Religion could be freely
 practiced by all groups.
 Freedoms of speech and assembly of certain persons and
 groups were also circumscribed by the unique Southern
 African administrative restriction called banning. If
 "banned" by the Minister of Law and Order, the named
 individual or group could not legally comunicate with
 designated individuals. The thoughts, writings, or often
 name of a "bannee" could not legally be reproduced or
 transmitted in any form.
 b.    Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, and Emigration
 The constitutional right of freedom of internal or external
 travel was heavily conditioned because of the war. Black
 residents in a "protected village" or other black areas
 under martial law needed permission to travel, which was
 reportedly often refused for security reasons. Curfews
 were in effect in all rural areas and in some sections of
 the cities, including Salisbury. Passports were relatively
 easy to obtain. However, foreign travel was effectively
 restricted by official limitations on the amount of money
 an individual was allowed to take with him when he traveled
 or emigrated. For example, a family which emigrated was
 allowed to take along only Rh dols 1,000 (US $1,470) plus
 personal effects and household items.
 c.    Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Parliament of "Zimbabwe Rhodesia" was elected in April
 1979 in an election based on universal adult suffrage.
 However, only whites, 4% of the population, were eligible
 to vote for the candidates for the 28 reserved white seats.
 Whites were also entitled to vote for the 72 "common
 roll" seats, in effect having two votes. Although most of
 the approximately 100 unofficial election observers believed
 that the elections were conducted in a reasonably free and
 fair fashion under the circumstances of the ongoing military
 conflict, there was disagreement on this point. Only
 recognized political parties, i.e. those which accepted the
 transitional framework, were allowed to participate, thus
 effectively excluding any opponents of the transitional
 arrangements or of the new constitution. Parties which did
 
 
 153
 not recognize the legitimacy of the constitution were
 outlawed or banned. The terms of the 1979 constitution
 ensured de facto white minority control of the army, the
 police, the judicial system and the civil service. It also
 entrenched a de facto veto power for whites over any
 significant constitutional and much legislative reform for
 at least ten years.
 Official discrimination on the basis of "race, tribe, place
 of origin, political opinions, colour, or creed" was uncon-
 stitutional. Sexual discrimination was not specifically
 declared unconstitutional. In addition, "African customary
 law," which was granted constitutional standing in
 some specific legal areas for persons living in the tradi-
 tional African context, sometimes conflicts with modern,
 western concepts of constitutional guarantees. Black women
 in "Zimbabwe Rhodesia" were considered dependents of either
 their husbands or fathers for most legal or economic
 transactions.
 Employees were-permitted to organize, and labor unions
 are active in a number of sectors. Legal, racially-based
 restrictions on union membership or employment were
 removed in 1959. In fact, a number of unions such as the
 Mineworkers have been multi-racial since that time.
 (White control of such unions, however, has been preserved
 through weighted voting based on skill levels. Of the
 approximately 8500 members of the Mineworkers Union,
 about 1000 are skilled, i.e. white.) Also, the country's
 long history of racial discrimination has led to continued
 de facto discrimination in employment opportunities and
 salaries. Nevertheless, these barriers were beginning to
 wither away gradually under economic as well as governmen-
 tal pressures. Efforts begun in 1978 to form a multi-racial
 trade union coordination body, including three of the six
 trade union groups, are expected to be realized early in
 1980 with the inauguration of the 300,000 member United
 Trade Unions of Zimbabwe.
 4.    Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 Within the limitations of censorship for security reasons,
 the Zimbabwe Rhodesian administration cooperated to some
 extent with investigations of the human rights situation.
 The administration allowed local representatives of the
 International Committee of the Red Cross to function in
 most areas, although it placed some restrictions on its
 access to detainees. The Catholic Commission for Justice
 and Peace had some of its reports banned, but it continued
 to have access to high-level government officials. On
 the other hand, foreigners who uncovered and publicized
 specific incidents of human rights abuse were often
 expelled.
