 JAPAN
 Japan is a parliamentary democracy operating within the
 framework of a constitution adopted in 1947. Sovereignty is
 vested in the people and the Emperor is defined as the symbol
 of state. On the national level, power is divided among
 executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Executive
 power is vested in a cabinet composed of a prime minister and
 ministers of state, and it is responsible to the Diet, Japan s
 two-house parliament. The Diet, elected under a system of
 universal suffrage and the secret ballot, has the
 responsibility to designate the prime minister, who must be a
 member of that body. Nearly 70 percent of the electorate
 usually votes in general elections, which involve candidates
 from six active and freely functioning political parties. The
 judicial system has several layers of courts, with the Supreme
 Court as the final authority.
 Japan's well-organized and disciplined national police forod
 has a good reputation for respecting the human rights of the
 populace, although there have been reports of incidents of
 misconduct by individual police officers, including harsh
 treatment of prisoners in their custody. The police force is
 firmly under the control of the civil authorities, and there
 is no evidence that it resorts to extralegal measures in the
 discharge of its duties. The Civil Liberties Bureau in the
 Ministry of Justice and the Human Rights and Refugee Division
 in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs monitor problems relating
 to human rights practices in Japan.
 Japan's thriving free market economy is the second largest in
 the world in terms of gross national product. The economy has
 traditionally been characterized as "export oriented," although
 considerable efforts were made during 1988 to stimulate
 domestic demand. Only 19 percent of the country is arable,
 but agriculture is practiced so intensively that the country
 has an agricultural self-sufficiency rate of arouad 70
 percent.
 Although the Japanese are receptive to foreign ideas, the
 citizens of this densely populated nation have a cultural,
 ethnic, and racial homogeneity which can make the integration
 of alien residents into Japanese society difficult. While the
 legal system has gradually evolved toward granting equality of
 opportunity to minorities, there remains social prejudice
 against koreans, around 687,000 of whom are first, second, and
 third generation permanent residents, in addition to the
 approximately 136,000 naturalized Japanese nationals of Korean
 ancestry. There are also about 84,000 ethnic Chinese living
 in Japan, the majority of whom are permanent residents rather
 than citizens. An estimated 1.2 million outcasts ("Burakumin")
 also suffer social but not legal discrimination. Additionally,
 there are about 25,000 registered descendants of the Ainu,
 Japan's indigenous people who reside primarily in Hokkaido and
 who suffer social discrimination. Okinawans, whose history
 and culture is different from that of mainland Japan,
 reportedly still suffer occasional social discrimination, but
 they are increasingly being integrated into Japanese society.
 The Constitution states that "all of the people are equal
 under the law and there shall be no discrimination in
 political, economic, or social relations because of race,
 creed, sex, social status, or family origin." The human
 rights assured by the Constitution and the bill of rights are
 secured by a just and efficient legal system.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known instances of politically motivated murder.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known instances of politically motivated
 abduction or clandestine detention.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment is provided for by the Constitution
 and respected in practice. Occasional reports of misconduct
 by individual police officers are investigated promptly and
 disciplinary action taken when warranted.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The constitutional provision for freedom from arbitrary arrest
 or imprisonment is respected in practice. Japanese law
 provides for judicial determination of the legality of
 detention. People cannot be detained without charge, and
 prosecuting authorities must be prepared to demonstrate before
 trial that probable cause exists to detain the accused. The
 length of time before a suspect is brought to trial depends on
 the nature of the crime but rarely exceeds 2 months; the
 average is 1 to 2 months. Preventive detention does not
 exist.
 Under the Criminal Procedure Code, a suspect may be held- in
 police custody for up to 72 hours. This period may be
 extended by 3 judge for up to 25 days if necessary. If an
 indictment follows, the suspect is transferred to a criminal
 detention facility. During 1988 the Government announced its
 intention to submit legislation to the Diet which, the
 Government maintains, would improve conditions in detention
 facilities and update the regulations which govern the
 pretrial detention period. The Japan Bar Association opposes
 the legislation, which was first presented to the Diet in 1982
 (and defeated), on the grounds that police powers need to be
 reduced and more fundamental revisions of the detention system
 are necessary.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for the right to a speedy and public
 trial by an impartial tribunal in all criminal cases, and this
 right is respected in. practice. The defendant is informed of
 charges upon arrest and assured a public trial by an
 independent civilian court with defense counsel and the right
 to cross-examination. The Constitution assures defendants the
 right not to be compelled to testify against themselves as
 well as free and private access to counsel. Defendants are
 also protected from the application of laws retroactively and
 have the right of access to incriminating evidence after a
 formal indictment has been made. A defendant who is
 
 
 826
 JAPAN
 dissatisfied with the decision of a trial court of first
 instance may, within the period prescribed by law, appeal to a
 higher court. There are several levels of courts, with the
 Supreme Court serving as the highest judicial authority.
 There is no trial by jury in Japan.
 The Constitution establishes an independent judiciary. Judges
 are appointed by the Cabinet for a 10-year term which may be
 renewed until the age of 65, but face periodic review through
 popular referendum. Judges may only be removed by public
 impeachment, unless they are judicially declared mentally or
 physically incompetent to perform their duties. The Japanese
 Constitution prohibits any disciplinary action against judges
 by any executive organ, including the Cabinet. There is no
 evidence of politicization of the judiciary. Justices of the
 Supreme Court may serve until the age of 70.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under the Constitution, each search or seizure must be made
 upon separate warrant issued by a judicial officer. The
 standards for issuing such warrants exist to guard against
 arbitrary searches. There were no reports that the Government
 or any other organization arbitrarily interfered with privacy,
 family, home, or correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution, an independent press and judiciary, and a
 functioning democratic political system combine to ensure
 freedom of speech and press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are provided for in the Constitution and
 respected in practice.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution and
 respected in practice. While Buddhism and Shintoism remain
 the two major religions, there are many others, including
 several Christian denominations. Missionaries are welcome and
 receive special visa status. Some temples and shrines, as
 treasured national properties, receive public support for
 maintenance.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Japanese citizens have the right to travel freely, both within
 Japan and abroad, to change their place of residence, to
 emigrate, and to repatriate voluntarily. Japanese nationality
 can be lost by naturalization in a foreign country or failure
 to elect Japanese nationality at the proper age. The Ministry
 of Justice administratively denies reentry permits to the
 small number of permanent resident aliens who are not in
 compliance with the fingerprint requirement of the Alien
 Registration Law. These people may return to Japan by
 
 
 827
 JAPAN
 obtaining a visa through a Japanese Embassy abroad but are not
 permitted to reestablish permanent residence until they
 fulfill the fingerprint requirement. They are instead given
 residence visas which must be renewed annually.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 As a parliamentary democracy, Japan is ruled by the political
 party or parties able to form a majority in the lower house of
 its bicameral Diet. The Liberal Democratic Party, which has
 been in power continuously since 1955, won a substantial
 parliamentary majority in the July 1986 national elections.
 Five opposition parties are active in elections, which are
 held every 3 to 4 years. The overwhelming majority of Diet
 members are men, but women are also represented. All adult
 citizens have the right to vote by secret ballot. Political
 interest groups may organize and engage in nonviolent political
 activity regardless of political beliefs. Well-organized
 labor unions ensure participation by workers in the political
 process.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In 1988 representatives of the Korean community in Japan
 petitioned the United Nations Committee of the International
 Human Rights Covenant to take up allegations of discrimination,
 especially regarding the fingerprint provision of the Alien
 Registration Law. Other groups petitioned the United Nations
 Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and
 Protection of Minorities to take up allegations of
 discrimination against Japan's indigenous people, the Ainu,
 and to look into Japan's criminal detention system. In each
 case, the Government responded to the complaints, and no
 further discussion or investigation followed.
 The Government is active in working for improvement of human
 rights practices in other countries. There is a Human Rights
 and Refugee Division in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which
 gives special attention to these matters.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 As a homogeneous nation with a long tradition of isolation
 from other cultures, Japanese society has been resistant to
 the integration of alien residents despite its general
 receptivity to foreign ideas. Entrenched social prejudice
 against both Korean residents (most of whom were born, raised,
 and educated in Japan) and members of the *Burakumin*
 community (descendants of feudal era *outcasts" who practiced
 so-called "unclean" professions such as butchering and
 undertaking) has restricted the access of both groups to
 private housing, employment, and marriage opportunities. The
 Ainu community also alleges discrimination, especially
 regarding employment opportunities.
 In recent years, the Government has enacted several laws and
 regulations extending to permanent resident aliens, 82 percent
 of whom are Koreans, the benefits of equal access to public
 housing and loans, social security pensions for those who
 otherwise qualify, and certain public employment rights. The
 Government in 1988 enacted a "Special Budget Measures for Area
 
 
 828
 JAPAN
 Improvement Projects Law," which provides funds until 1992 to
 complete projects started under a similar law which expired in
 1987. That law, first issued in 1969, was designed to help
 assimilate Burakumin into mainstream society through a number
 of social, economic, and legal programs.
 The Government acted to rectify an issue of concern to
 resident Koreans in 1987, when it revised the alien
 registration law to require only a single fingerprinting of
 foreign residents rather than repeated fingerprinting at
 5-year intervals. Human rights activists representing Korean
 residents are not satisfied with the revised law and have
 called for complete abolition of the fingerprinting
 requirement.
 According to law, aliens with 5 years' continuous residence
 are eligible for naturalization and the simultaneous
 acquisition of citizenship rights, including the right to
 vote. In fact, however, relatively few eligible aliens have
 been naturalized. Many permanent residents are unwilling to
 seek naturalization on the ground that their cultural identity
 would be erased by that act. A high intermarriage rate and
 changes in the naturalization law several years ago to allow
 Japanese women, as well as men, to convey citizenship to the
 offspring of mixed marriages will eventually reduce the number
 of non-citizen Korean residents of Japan.
 There are some 23.6 million women workers in Japan, comprising
 40 percent of the employed population. Discrimination by
 private employers against women is prohibited by the
 Constitution and by legislative measures adopted over the past
 30 years to accord women the same legal status as men. In
 April 1986, the equal employment opportunity law came into
 effect. The law was intended to eliminate sex discrimination
 in such areas as recruitment and hiring, pay inequality, and
 the amount of night or overtime hours that can be worked. It
 has been criticized as containing no concrete measures, such
 as penalties for violators, to ensure equality for women
 workers. In any case, passage of this legislation has not in
 itself changed the prevailing social attitudes which discourage
 women from seeking and obtaining positions of managerial
 responsibility. Women who wish to pursue careers often find
 obstacles in their way and are unlikely to advance as quickly
 as their male counterparts. Significant disparities remain
 between the salaries of men and women workers.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right of association as defined by the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) is protected in Japan. The right of
 workers to organize, bargain, and act collectively is assured
 by the Japanese Constitution. Slightly under 28 percent of
 the active work force belongs to labor unions. Unions are
 free of government control and interference. Most unions are
 involved in political activity as well as labor relations.
 They are active in international bodies, most notably the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the ILO.
 The right to strike is implicitly assumed by the Constitution
 and it is exercised frequently. Public employees, however,
 do not have the right to strike, although they do have
 recourse to mediation and arbitration in order to resolve
 disputes. In exchange for a ban on their right to strike,
 government employees' pay raises are determined by the
 
 
 829
 JAPAN
 Government, based on a recommendation by the independent
 National Personnel Authority.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Constitution states that unions have the right to
 organize, bargain, and act collectively and these rights are
 exercised in practice. Members of the armed forces., police
 officers, and fire fighters are not permitted to organize.
 Japanese law also allows unions to lobby and to make political
 campaign contributions. Japan does not have export processing
 zones. Labor laws and regulations are observed uniformly
 throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Labor Standards Law prohibits the use of forced labor, and
 there were no known cases of forced or compulsory labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Under the revised Labor Standards Law of 1987, minors under 15
 years of age may not be employed as workers and those under
 the age of 18 years may not be employed in dangerous or
 harmful work. Child labor laws are rigorously enforced by the
 Labor Inspection Division of the Ministry of Labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Labor Standards Law provides for the phased reduction of
 maximum working hours from the present 48-hour, 6-day workweek
 to 40 hours by early in the next decade. Although introduced
 as a means of increasing leisure time available to the work
 force, the law has been criticized by employee groups because
 of the increased flexibility it gives employers in calculating
 actual working hours and vacation benefits. Minimum wages are
 set regionally, not nationally. For example, as of October,
 the Tokyo metropolitan area minimum wage was $4.16 hourly (at
 $1.00 - 122 yen). This is the highest regionally set
 minimum. The minimum wage for Kagoshima prefecture was $3.50,
 Japan's lowest regional minimum wage. In addition, regions
 have minimum wage rates for certain industries. These vary
 from region to region, but they are higher than nonindustry
 specific regional minimum wage rates. These wage rates are
 sufficient to provide workers and their families with a decent
 living. The Ministry of Labor effectively administers various
 laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety,
 principal among which is the Industrial Safety and Health Law
 of 1972.
