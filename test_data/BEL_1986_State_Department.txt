 BELGIUM
 Belgium is a parliamentary democracy under a constitutional
 monarch. In practice the Council of Ministers (Cabinet) is
 responsible for governmental decisions. The Council, led by
 the Prime Minister, holds office as long as it retains the
 confidence of the Parliament, which includes 13 political
 parties split along linguistic and ideological lines.
 Direct popular elections for parliamentary seats (excluding 76
 of the 182 Senate seats apportioned by other means) are held
 at least every 4 years under a system of universal suffrage,
 obligatory voting, and proportional representation. The
 Flemish and Francophone Social Christian Parties have been the
 major modern-day political force in Belgium, leading or
 participating in virtually all of the 30-odd coalition
 governments since World War II.
 Domestic security in Belgium is primarily the responsibility
 of the national paramilitary Gendarmerie, the judicial police,
 and a host of municipal police forces. The armed forces play
 no role in domestic law enforcement.
 A series of terrorist-type attacks in October 1984, led by a
 Belgian group, the C.C.C. (Communist Combat Cells), took the
 Belgians by surprise, leading them to question their security
 and the forces intended to assure it. In 1986, the Minister
 of Justice proposed a wide-ranging series of internal police
 reforms and policy changes to cope with future terrorist
 problems, including a computer databank on terrorism,
 government infiltration of terrorist groups, and court-ordered
 wiretaps under certain conditions.
 Belgium also continues to contend with the social, economic,
 and racial pressures apparently linked to the presence of a
 large immigrant population.
 Belgium has an excellent human rights record, which was not
 compromised by the problems with which it has had to deal.
 Respect for human rights in Belgium is guaranteed in the
 Constitution and laws, and was observed in practice in 1986.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Neither the Belgian authorities nor officially sanctioned
 groups engage in killings for political motives. No deaths
 resulted in 1986 from the actions of politically motivated
 terrorist groups. Attacks by the C.C.C. took the lives of two
 firemen in May 1985 as a result of a car-bomb explosion,
 although the C.C.C. claimed the deaths were accidental. The
 arrest of the group's suspected leaders in early 1986 may have
 ended this period of terrorism. However, in the last half of
 1986 there were three bomb attacks: an unclaimed bombing in
 Antwerp outside the Flemish Socialist Labor Federation office
 in August, another unclaimed bombing outside Brussels' Masonic
 Lodge in September (which caused minor injuries to passersby),
 and a bombing outside Antwerp's principal synagogue in
 November. The latter attack was claimed by two groups: one
 called "Adolf Eche Holstein Mein Kampf" in Brussels and the
 other called the "Call of Christ" in Lebanon.

 b. Disappearance
 Abductions, secret arrests, or clandestine detentions by
 government or other officially condoned elements are
 proscribed by Belgian law and did not occur.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Penal Code prohibits deliberate mistreatment or injury of
 another and is applicable to the actions of both officials and
 private individuals. In September 1986, Belgium's Public
 Prosecutor indicted several members of Brussels' judicial
 police for the torture of a Zairean bookstore attendant during
 his arrest and detention in 1982. Previous cases of this sort
 have led to disciplinary action against the police, usually
 accompanied by forced resignations. To expose such abuses
 more quickly, the Prosecutor called on the Government to pass
 a law requiring that police who witness misdeeds committed by
 other police report the behavior to higher authorities.
 Although crowded and aging prisons are an issue in Belgium,
 cruel and inhuman punishment is not practiced. There are no
 differences in the conditions of confinement based on race,
 sex, religion, or social class, although prison officials
 try to accommodate special religious or medical diets.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment is guaranteed
 by law. Arrested persons must be brought before a judge
 within 24 hours or released. Belgian law provides for pretrial
 confinement only under the following special circumstances:
 when a person is apprehended in the commission of a criminal
 act; when there is a risk that the suspect will prove a danger
 to the community; when there is a risk that the accused will
 flee the jurisdiction; and when the case involves one of a
 number of serious offenses specified by law. The justification
 for such confinement is subject to monthly review by a panel
 of judges.
 In practice, there is growing concern among local human rights
 groups and parliamentarians that pretrial detention is
 sometimes abused. Bail exists in principle under Belgian law,
 but is rarely granted in practice. There is no limit on how
 long an accused may be held prior to coming to trial. The
 president of the Belgian League for the Defense of Human
 Rights has expressed his concern that extended pretrial
 detention occurs more and more frequently in cases involving
 immigrants.
 Exile of Belgian citizens is not permitted by law. Forced
 labor for political, ideological, discriminatory, or
 educational ends is unknown in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair public trial, including the right to counsel, is
 guaranteed by law and honored in practice. A suspect is
 charged, if the evidence warrants, when the preliminary
 judicial investigatory phase is completed. Charges are
 clearly and formally stated. No one is imprisoned because of
 political beliefs.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Freedom from arbitrary interference with privacy by the State
 is guaranteed by law and respected in practice. The
 Constitution specifically guarantees the inviolability of the
 home except in cases laid down and regulated by law. The law
 forbids searches of private homes at night, except in special
 circumstances. Warrants issued by a judge are required unless
 the inhabitants of the domicile agree to the search. The
 Penal Code provides penalties for all violations of the home
 by officials as well as by private persons.
 Monitoring of telephones and interference with mail are also
 strictly prohibited. The Minister of Justice has said,
 however, that he plans to seek legislation to allow the use of
 court-approved wiretaps by law enforcement agencies under
 certain limited circumstances, e.g., terrorist cases.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Varying political, religious, philosophical, and
 artistic views are permitted free public expression, and there
 is no political censorship of the media. There are, however,
 prohibitions on publications and productions held to undermine
 "public order" (e.g., explicit pornography and incitement to
 violence). There are laws against libel, provisions for a
 citizen's right of reply to media criticism, and restrictions
 on criticism of government policies by civil servants.
 Belgium has state-owned radio and television networks, but
 there is no direct government control of program content.
 Their programs are supervised by boards of directors which
 represent the main currents of opinion. The Government has a
 representative on the boards but no veto power.
 Private radio stations operate with government licenses, since
 a late 1985 decision by the Ministry of Communications which
 legalized them for the first time. Belgium has yet to pass
 legislation permitting the existence of television stations
 not owned by the State. Most urban homes have access to
 foreign television from neighboring countries via cable.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political, civic, religious, artistic, social, and special
 interest groups are permitted free public assembly, subject to
 regulations of public order. Labor unions and groups
 protesting government policies or actions are free from
 harassment and persecution, although permits are required for
 open-air assemblies.
 The right to organize, strike, and bargain collectively is
 recognized and exercised freely in Belgium, although
 government austerity measures sometimes limit or alter the
 results of collective bargaining. The degree of union
 organization is one of the highest in the world, approximately
 70 percent of the workforce. Labor unions are strong and
 independent of the Government, but have important informal
 links with and influence on many of the major political
 parties. The unions do not allow their leaders to hold
 political office.

 c. Freedom of Religion
 Belgium has a long tradition of religious tolerance. The
 Christian, Jewish, and Muslim religions are accorded a
 "recognized" status in law, which includes a government
 subsidy. Other "nonrecognized" religions enjoy full freedom
 to practice and are not subject to harassment or persecution.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration,. and Repatriation
 Belgian citizens enjoy freedom of travel within the country
 and internationally, including the right of voluntary
 repatriation.
 In May 1985, a law took effect that gives municipalities in
 the greater Brussels region the right to refuse to register
 new foreigners--defined as citizens of non-European Community
 countries--as residents. Such registration is required of all
 persons residing in Belgium, with some exceptions. To date,
 seven municipalities have taken advantage of the new law,
 which in effect serves to limit somewhat the freedom of
 foreigners to decide where they reside in Belgium.
 Belgium continues to have a generous policy on political
 refugees. Anyone arriving in Belgium can claim political
 asylum and will be allowed to stay in Belgium long enough to
 pursue that claim. Belgium continues-automatically to grant
 the right of political asylum to those foreign nationals
 recommended by the local office of the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). However, mounting public
 concern about the growing number of immigrants has led the
 Government to introduce legislation that would restrict the
 availability of asylum and place responsibility for refugee
 recommendations on a Belgian agency rather than the UNHCR.
 The local head of the UNHCR has stated that the current
 arrangement leaves candidates who have been refused refugee
 status by the UNHCR without an independent outlet for appeal.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Participation in the political system is open to all citizens.
 Suffrage is universal for all adults (18 and over), secret,
 and compulsory. Unweighted voting (one person/one vote) has
 been in effect since 1919 for men and since 1949 for women.
 There are 13 parties currently represented in the Belgian
 Parliament. Opposition parties are free, under law and in
 practice, to operate without constraints or repression.
 The existence of Dutch- and French-speaking regions poses
 significant problems for the State. All major institutions,
 including political parties, are divided along linguistic
 lines. There are special provisions for Dutch-, French-, and
 German-speaking councils at the regional level. Regional and
 linguistic needs are taken into account in national decisions.
 Two French-speaking Belgians, elected in 1981 to represent
 francophone suburbs of Brussels located within the political
 boundaries of the Flemish regional council, complained to the
 European Court of Human Rights that they had been deprived of
 their right to free elections by a Belgian law which allows
 only Dutch-speaking Belgians to be elected to the Flemish
 council. The Court's decision is expected in early 1987.
 
 
 867
 BELGIUM
 In October 1986, the national Government entered a period of
 instability due to the controversy created by a similar case.
 The Council of State found that the French-speaking mayor of a
 French-speaking majority town located within Dutch-speaking
 Flanders could not be mayor because of his inability to speak
 Dutch, as required by law for mayors in Flanders.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has been active in the United Nations and other
 international forums in promoting human rights, and became a
 member of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in 1986. It has
 also promoted independent investigation of alleged human
 rights violations. In 1986, no requests were made for outside
 investigation of the human rights situation in Belgium. There
 are several active independent human rights groups in Belgium,
 and they consider the Government open to discussion of any
 human rights question.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Belgium is a culturally active, pluralistic society in which
 individual differences in general are respected and linguistic
 rights in particular are protected. Some 57 percent of
 Belgians are native Dutch speakers living primarily in the
 northern provinces that constitute Flanders. The 42 percent
 of French speakers tend to live in the capital, Brussels, and
 the southern provinces called Wallonia. The small minority of
 German speakers live along the eastern border. These language
 differences have been the subject of hundreds of laws over the
 last century, leading to a fairly rigid structure designed to
 protect each language group from cultural, economic, or
 political dominance by the others.
 Food, shelter, health care, and education are available to all
 inhabitants regardless of race, sex, religion, language,
 social status, or ethnic background. Some 25 percent of the
 residents of Brussels, the nation's largest city, are
 foreigners, leading to a concentration of immigrants,
 primarily North Africans. The immigrant population tends to
 be poorer, less skilled, and less educated than the average,
 and is increasingly the focus of public debate.
 Belgium is active in the area of women's rights. The
 Consultative Commission for the Condition of Women, attached
 to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, advises the Government on
 international women's issues. Within the country there are
 several other commissions on women's rights that deal with
 oversight of women's education and working conditions. There
 are numerous women members of the Senate and Chamber of
 Representatives, and there are three women in Cabinet posts.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Belgium continued to suffer in 1986 from slow economic growth
 and high unemployment, currently between 12 and 13 percent.
 Governmental policies to promote employment and an extensive
 system of unemployment compensation and other social benefits
 have served to minimize serious individual financial hardship.
 Belgian working hours, mandated by law and collective
 agreement, are the shortest in Europe, averaging about 37

 BELGIUM
 hours a week. There are generous provisions for minimum wage
 (currently almost $600 a month for full-time work for those
 over 21 years of age, with a slightly lower youth minimum
 wage), vacations, and unemployment benefits. Adequate health
 and safety legislation exists, supplemented by collective
 bargaining agreements, and health and safety committees are
 mandated by law at enterprises with more than 50 employees.
 The minimum age for employment of children is 16; children can
 work and study part-time from age 16 to 18.
