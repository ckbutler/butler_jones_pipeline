 CAMEROON
 Political power in Cameroon is concentrated in the Presidency
 and a single party, the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement
 (CPDM). President Paul Biya is Head of State and head of the
 CPDM. The President makes all major decisions and appoints
 all government and party officials, although key
 parliamentarians have some behind-the-scenes influence. The
 National Assembly generally approves measures proposed by the
 Government. Although the Assembly has the right to propose
 legislation, it does so rarely. Cameroon's political system
 is influenced by its ethnic and linguistic diversity, which
 includes 230 languages and 3 separate European colonial
 traditions (German, French, and British). French and English
 are official languages. A careful balancing act among the
 various groups within the Government and party is required to
 maintain political cohesion, and this acts as a check on
 government power.
 Internal security responsibilities are shared by the National
 Police (Surete Nationale), the National Intelligence Service
 (CENER), the Ministry of Territorial Administration, Military
 Intelligence, and, to a lesser extent, the Presidential
 Security Service. The Ministry of Territorial Administration
 is in charge of prisons, and the National Police has the
 dominant role in enforcing internal security laws.
 Cameroon's per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of about
 $970 in 1987 placed it among the middle-income developing
 countries. However, the declining prices of Cameroon's key
 commodities, including coffee, cocoa, and petroleum, and the
 rigors of structural adjustment are likely to reduce 1989 per
 capita gross.domestic product to an estimated $850.
 Cameroon's diversified agricultural base, food
 self-sufficiency, and government policies aimed at promoting
 private-sector growth help mitigate the effects of declining
 terms of trade and other external difficulties.
 Human rights remained restricted in Cameroon in 1989.
 Positive developments included the release of dissident author
 Albert Mukong and mone openness in_-addressing human rights
 issues. In March a-senior official responded publicly to
 Amnesty International's (AI)-concerns about political
 prisoners, admitting that some persons remained in detention
 despite the expiration of their sentences. President Biya has
 officially advocated greater democratization, and modest steps
 have been taken to expand popular political participation.
 Major human rights concerns in 1989 included the abuse of
 detainees, use of arbitrary arrest and detention powers, harsh
 prison conditions, and restrictions on freedoms of speech,
 press, assembly, women's rights, worker rights, and the right
 of citizens to change their government through democratic
 means.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of such killings in 1989.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance.
 
 
 CAMEROON
 C. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although the penal code proscribes- torture, renders
 inadmissible in court evidence obtained thereby, and prohibits
 public servants from using force against any person, there
 were credible reports of severe beatings of suspects while in
 custody in 1989. On one occasion, witnesses observed security
 officers publicly punching and beating a man. Inside prisons,
 poor conditions are common. Prisoners suffer from serious
 malnutrition unless provided food by friends or family.
 Brutal treatment of inmates may have led to violent uprisings
 in at least two Cameroonian prisons in 1989. Persons under
 "administrative detention" (e.g., political detainees) are
 kept in-special camps or prisons to which access by families
 and friends is severely restricted.
 AI's 1989 Repbrt stresses the harsh conditions in Nkondengui
 Prison in Yaounde and New Bell Prison in Douala.
 Overcrowding, the lack of medical care, and malnutrition may
 have contributed to a high death rate in both prisons in 1988,
 according to AI.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Cameroonian law, a person arrested on suspicion of
 having committed a nonpolitical offense may be held in custody
 up to 24 houks before being charged. The period of custody
 may be renewed up to three times with the express agreement of
 the Attorney-General. However, after an investigating
 magistrate has determined the case should be brought to trial
 and has issued a warrant to that effect, there is no
 limitation on-how long the detainee may be held in "preventive
 detention" pending trial.
 Accused persons awaiting trial constitute the majority of
 persons in the prisons'at Yaounde and Douala. Release on bail
 is permitted by law only in the Anglophone provinces, whose
 legal system retains features of British common law. Even
 there, bail is granted infrequently. There have been cases of
 local or provincial authorities ordering the continued
 detention of persons even after a court ordered their
 release. CENER and Military Security do not implement fully
 the penal code requirement that detainees be brought before a
 magistrate for investigation of possible offenses. They have
 held detainees ihcommunicado.
 Persons may also be held in "administrative detention" under
 legislation pertaining to subversion. The penal code defines
 administrative detention as "the loss of liberty for a
 political felony or misdemeanor." Such detention by regional
 authorities is initially for 1 month, renewable twice, and may
 be extended up to an additional 6 months by the Minister of
 Territorial Administration. Those arrested and placed in
 administrative detention do not disappear. Their families are
 told where they are, though not always promptly. They are
 released eventually, though the detention may be lengthy, in
 some cases exceeding the theoretical maximum of 9 months.
 State of emergency provisions, invoked-Crllowing the 1984 coup
 attempt, were allowed to lapse in 1989. There is, therefore,
 no longer a legal rationale for unlimited administrative
 detention. Government of Cameroon authorities state that they
 are working to ensure that officials who have had delegated
 
 
 48
 CAMEROON
 authority to order such detention are made aware of the
 changed circumstances.
 Albert Mukong, a well-known critic of the Government who had
 been held for nearly a year, was released on May 5 after the
 Government dropped charges against him. It is widely believed
 that Mukong was arrested for having condemned, during a
 British Broadcasting Corporation broadcast, frequent
 constitutional changes and attributing Cameroon's economic
 difficulties to embezzlement of state funds by senior public
 officials. The legal justification for his detention remains
 unclear but was apparently an old ordinance which proscribes
 conduct "likely to bring to contempt or ridicule any public
 authority or (which) incites hatred against the government."
 Frederic Batoum and Samuel Zeze remained in prison without
 charge at the end of 1989, apparently for supporting the
 banned opposition party, the Union of Cameroonian People
 (UPC). They had first been arrested in 1985, released in
 1986, and then detained again shortly afterwards. Abdoulaye
 Mazou, a former senior official of the Ministry of Education,
 was sentenced to 5 years for having assisted his brother to
 escape after the 1984 coup attempt. Although his sentence has
 expired, he remains in prison and is reportedly ill.
 An estimated 40 political detainees, including Moussa Mahmonde
 and Mohamadou Djidji, who were not released in 1986 at the end
 of their sentence, reportedly remained in detention at the end
 of 1989. Most of these were apprehended around the time of
 the 1984 coup attempt.
 Cameroon does not engage in the practice of forced exile.
 Early in his first term, President Biya publicly encouraged
 all those living abroad for political reasons to return to
 Cameroon without fear of reprisal.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trial by a presiding magistrate is provided for in law, and
 this practice is followed except in the case of persons held
 under administrative detention or state of emergency
 regulations. Public trials are also guaranteed by law,
 although exceptions are allowed for the public good or for
 national security reasons. Trials which involve prominent
 persons or which are controversial have sometimes been held in
 private.
 Magistrates in Cameroon are career civil servants responsible
 to the Minister of Justice and are required to have law
 degrees. Their decisions are not usually subject to
 government interference, and they generally are considered to
 conduct fair trials. The Minister of Justice has publicly
 cautioned magistrates against awarding "excessive" damages
 against the State, and there have been reported cases of the
 Government refusing to pay damages where a court has found
 against it. Defendants in felony cases are provided attorneys
 if they cannot afford to engage their own.
 Crimes involving subversion or illegal use of weapons, as well
 as crimes involving the military, are tried by military
 tribunals. Each tribunal has three members, and its presiding
 officer must be a magistrate. In some cases, the magistrate
 is a civilian, in others a military officer. As in felony
 
 
 CAMIEROON
 cases tried in the regular court system, defendants are
 entitled to counsel.
 In a March 1989 press conference, Cameroon's Ambassador to
 France answered publicly a question from AI about political
 prisoners held in Cameroon. According to AI, he indicated
 that most of them are military officers implicated in the 1984
 coup attempt. Some of them were never brought to trial, and
 others have been held past the end of their sentences. Those
 trials were conducted in secret by military tribunals and did
 not conform to internationally recognized standards of
 fairness. Lawyers were given little time to prepare a
 defense, and defendants had no right of appeal. The
 Ambassador admitted that coup-plotters were still held under
 administrative internment and asserted that their continued
 detention was necessary in view of the danger they pose to
 public safety. This is the first time in years that'a
 government official has publicly addressed the issue of
 political prisoners/detainees held without trial in Cameroon.
 Traditional courts continue to play an important role in
 Cameroon, particularly in rural areas. Their authority varies
 by region and by ethnic group, but they are often the arbiters
 of property'and domestic disputes and may serve a probate
 function as well. Most systems permit appeal of first-
 instance decisions to traditional authorities of higher rank.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Both invasions of the home and tampering with correspondence
 are violations of Cameroonian law. There have been frequent
 reports of police harassing citizens and entering homes
 without warrants during periodic searches for criminals.
 Police officials also sometimes enter homes and demand to see
 receipts for household property as a customs law enforcement
 measure. Surveillance of suspected dissidents and the
 moitoring of their mail and telephone conversations are
 common practices.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties-, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution of 1972 provides for freedom'of expression
 and of the press, but Cameroonian law and practice restrict
 these freedoms. While there is no evidence anyone is punished
 for privately criticizing the Government, there are definite
 limits to public speech.
 The Government's official position is that it "supervises" but
 does not "control" the press. However, officials working with
 the media have referred to television, radio, and the press as
 instruments of national policy to be used by the State in
 furtherance of its aims. The Government publishes two
 official- newspapers, the English and French editions of the
 Cameroon Tribune, and controls radio (the most important
 medium) and television. Most official journalists are civil
 servants who may be transferred to less desirable positions if
 they do not practice self-censorship.
 Media criticism of the Government invites detention. There
 have been several cases of print or broadcast journalists
 being detained after.pursuing stories critical of the
 Government in recent years. Early in 1989, for example, two
 
 
 50
 journalists from the independent press were detained after
 publishing a story recounting the reasons for a local town
 council's vote of no-confidence in its Mayor. AI noted in its
 1989 Report that there seems to be a pattern in the official
 use of detention powers as a means of intimidating
 journalists. Despite this, the number and frequency of
 private publications rebounded somewhat in late 1989. No
 written ground rules for publication exist. The independent
 press enjoys greater latitude in covering issues than the
 government-owned press, but all publications are still subject
 to official censorship.
 Although many periodicals carrying artieles critical of
 Cameroon's Government circulated in 1989, toward the end of
 the year the Government seized one edition of a foreign
 newsmagazine.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association are provided for in the
 Constitution but are restricted in law and practice. The
 penal code prohibits public meetings, demonstrations, or
 processions without prior government approval. While there
 have been no reports that such permits have been denied, large
 public meetings in which the Government plays no role are
 virtually unknown. On short notice, authorities canceled this
 year's traditional May Day parade because they were concerned
 that the unemployed might demonstrate. Organizations must
 register with the Government; any form of opposition political
 organization is effectively prohibited.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Cameroon is a secular state. There is no established
 religion. Roughly 20 percent of Cameroonians are Muslims, 30
 percent are Christians, and the rest follow traditional
 beliefs. Officials of the Government and the CPDM include
 members of all three groups. Freedom of religion is provided
 for in the Constitution, but for a religious group to exist
 and to function legally, it must be approved and registered
 with the Ministry of Territorial Administration. There have
 been cases in the past of a small group's application being
 rejected on the grounds that it was too nearly identical to an
 existing group. The Jehovah's Witnesses were banned in 1970
 and have been periodic targets of harassment since that time.
 The Government does not discourage the practice of traditional
 religions. Acts of witchcraft, divination, or magic "liable
 to disrupt public order or tranquility, or to harm persons or
 property" are outlawed, with potential penalties of up to 10
 years' imprisonment.
 Missionaries played a major role in the development of
 Cameroon and continue to be active. Foreign clergy suffer no
 ill-treatment. There are no particular restrictions on places
 of worship, training of clergy, conversion, religious
 education, or religious participation in charitable
 activities. The literacy and Bible translation organization,
 SIL, operates freely and plans to expand. Independent
 Christian and Muslim publications exist in Cameroon, and there
 is no evidence they are more heavily censored than is the
 secular press.

 CA14EROON
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the'country is not restricted by
 law. Police continue to stop travelers to check
 identification documents, vehicle registrations, and tax
 receipts as a security and immigration control measure, though
 use of the practice declined sharply in 1989.
 Exit visas are required to leave the country and are sometimes
 obtained only after long delays. The Government has been
 known to refuse issuance of a passport or to confiscate a
 passport in order to control someone it considers a real or
 potential threat. Married women must obtain written consent
 front their husbands before the Government will issue an exit
 visa. There are no restrictions on voluntary repatriation,
 and there is no forced resettlement.
 Over the years, Cameroon has served as a safe haven for
 thousands of dispaced persons and refugees. Approximately
 35,000 refugees remain in Cameroon, the majority of them
 Chadian. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) recognizes about 4,100, most of them Chadian or
 Namibian. With the Chadian conflict largely over, many
 Chadians have returned. As of September 30, 1989, there were
 3,622 Chadian refugees at the Poli-Faro camp, down from 6,346
 at the beginning of the year. Many of the Chadians living
 outside Poli-Faro have integrated into the Cameroonian economy
 and do not receive government or international assistance.
 Though Cameroon occasionally returns illegal Chadian
 immigrants, there were no confirmed reports of forced
 repatriation of recognized Chadian refugees in 1989. Cameroon
 is also host to 67 Namibian students and 400 other refugees of
 various nationalities.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Because Cameroon continues to be a one-party state with
 political power and administrative responsibility concentrated
 in the Presidency, citizens do not have the right to change
 the Government through the electoral process. The President
 appoints all cabinet ministers, governors, and prefects.
 President Biya succeeded constitutionally to the office of
 President upon the resignation of former President Ahidjo, and
 was elected unopposed in 1984 and 1988.
 While the Constitution does not explicitly exclude the
 existence of other political parties, in fact only the CPDM is
 permitted to operate. Membership in the CPDM is open to all
 religious and ethnic groups and is strongly encouraged. No
 one attempted to gain legal recognition for a second political
 party in 1989. The UPC was rebuffed in 1985 when it sought
 such legal recognition. Opposition groups, including the UPC
 and the Cameroon Democratic Party, periodically send letters
 or pamphlets into the country (usually seized by customs
 officials) or are heard on foreign radio broadcasts. A number
 of former UPC members are now active in the CPDM.
 Some within the CPDM have begun to advocate greater pluralism,
 but it is unclear whether they wish to make room for other
 parties or are merely seeking opportunities for broader debate
 or greater influence within the CPDM.
 All members of.the 180-seat National Assembly must be members
 
 
 52
 CAMERON
 of the CPDM. National Assembly elections with multiple
 candidacies were held for the first time in 1988, but the CPDM
 limited the number of candidates per constituency to two. The
 next elections are due in 1993. Voting is by universal
 suffrage and secret ballot. The 1988 elections took place
 with few irregularities and no allegations of fraud.
 Debate in the National Assembly usually remains within fairly
 narrow parameters. The National Assembly has not formally
 rejected a major government initiative in recent years.
 However, the behind-the-scenes power of key National Assembly
 representatives limits the Government's freedom of action.
 Some government proposals are shelved before reaching the
 stage where they are subject to formal rejection.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government does not usually respond publicly or privately
 to inquiries from any human rights organization. However, in
 1989 a government official responded publicly to Al's charge
 that Cameroon holds political prisoners (see Section l.e.).
 The Constitution affirms support for the freedoms guaranteed
 in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United
 Nations Charter. Under President Biya, the Government has
 devoted increased attention to human rights in such
 international forums as the United Nations and the Non-Aligned
 Movement. Also, Cameroon has submitted reports on the status
 of human rights in the country to two United Nations
 committees.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Access to the Government's social programs is open to all
 Cameroonian citizens on a nondiscriminatory basis. President
 Biya has repeatedly stressed publicly the dangers of
 tribalism, but there remains deep-seated suspicion among
 ethnic groups. Cameroon is officially bilingual, but
 Anglophones are a distinct minority (20 percent) and often
 charge that the majority Francophones discriminate against
 them by denying them economic opportunity and a share of real
 political power commensurate with their numbers. The
 Bamileke, the country's largest single ethnic group (between
 15 and 20 percent of the population), level similar charges
 against the rest of the body politic.
 Women are granted equal rights under the Constitution, and
 some are politically active in the party and the sole labor
 federation. The women's wing of the CPDM has developed
 programs to encourage the economic and social productivity of
 Cameroonian women. Women are increasingly well represented in
 the modern wage sector. They make up less than 1 percent of
 the army and do not serve in the navy or air force. They may
 join the police and the gendarmerie but make up a very small
 percentage of these forces.
 Significant cultural pressure is brought to bear on women to
 remain subservient to men. In late 1989, for example, a
 columnist for a government-owned newspaper admonished a reader
 to remember "your husband is the direct authority the lord has
 placed on you." Also, the Government requires a husband's
 consent before his wife may obtain an exit visa (see Section
 2.d.), a policy the Government asserts is intended solely to
 
 
 53
 CAMEROON
 preserve and strengthen the stability of family life.
 Polygamy is permitted by law and tradition, but polyandry is
 not.
 Hospital reports of admissions of battered women indicate
 declining violence against women, at least in urban areas. A
 government-owned newspaper in late 1989 featured a readers'
 debate on the pros and cons of wife beating, stating in its
 introduction that it took no position in the debate. There
 are no reliable statistics on the extent to which violence
 occurs._,,In crimes of passion, men are sometimes treated
 lightly by the courts. Violence directed against women in
 other tha.3 a domestic context is not a major problem. Female
 circumcision is not common in Cameroon. It is practiced by a
 limited number of traditional Muslim families and is almost
 unheard of in other groups.
 One of the goals of the sixth 5-year plan for economic,
 social, and cultural development is to improve educational
 opportunities for women. The percentage of female secondary
 school students increased 45 percent between 1970 and 1986.
 Girls made up 45.7 percent of primary school pupils in 1986,
 but their percentage drops to 38.3 percent at the secondary
 level, Women are also disadvantaged in access to higher
 education (14 percent of students) and professional
 opportunities. Regional differences in access to education
 also exist.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The labor code recognizes the right of workers to establish
 trade unions without prior authorization and to join trade
 unions of their choosing. In practice, there is but one
 umbrella organization in the country, the'Organization of
 United Cameroonian Workers (OCWU), which operates parallel to
 the CPDM, and trade unions in the country are subordinate to
 the OCWU. The top union leadership is nominated by the
 Government. The OCWU permitted multiple candidates to run in
 worker delegate elections in late 1987 and early 1988, but it
 retains the right to approve candidacies, thus assuring
 political orthodoxy. The OCWU does not play a major role in
 Cameroonian politics, although it has a membership of
 approximately 450,000 in a working population of more than 3
 million. It pursues worker grievances and seeks improvements
 in government programs for worker safety and training.
 Strikes are illegal, and political activity by trade unions,
 excepting action designed to protect economic and other
 interests, is prohibited. The OCWU is a member of the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity. The OCWU maintains
 contact with foreign trade union organizations, including the
 American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial
 Organizations, but such contact requires government
 authorization.
 The International Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee of
 Experts (COE) observed-in 1989 that various legislative
 provisions, which regulate the right of public servants to
 organize, restrict their right to strike, and ban foreign
 workers from trade union office, are inconsistent with ILO
 Convention 87 on Freedom of Association. It has expressed the
 hope that the Government will amend the legislation in the
 near future.
 
 
 54
 CAMEROON
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The labor code recognizes the right of trade unions or trade
 union federations to engage in 6ollective bargaining with
 employers or groups of employers. In practice, true
 collective bargaining between employers and workers is rare,
 owing to the small size of the modern industrial sector, the
 small number of large employers, and the involvement of the
 Government in the process. Under the law, all employers of
 more than 10 workers-must:permit the election of a worker
 representative from among the employees. This individual has
 a statutory right to discuss labor conditions with the
 employer on behalf of the employees and enjoys special
 protection from arbitrary dismissal. Candidates for these
 positions must be approved by the OCWU.
 There are no export processing zones in Cameroon, but one is
 in the planning stage.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 -While forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law, the COE
 has noted that provisions of the labor code, the law
 establishing the National Civic Service for participation in
 development, legislation respecting prisons, and the Merchant
 Shipping Code are in violation of the ILO conventions on
 forced labor. The Government has stated repeatedly that
 amendments to bring these laws into compliance with ILO
 conventions are being processed or are under study. There
 have been reports of levies of communal labor being employed
 in some traditional societies.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The labor code sets the minimum working age at 14, a rule
 which appears to be respected in the modern wage sector.
 Labor inspectors are empowered to enforce provisions of
 Cameroon's labor code, as are labor courts. In rural areas
 where farming occupies 80 percent of Cameroon's citizens,
 children participate at early ages in agricultural work
 alongside adults. Street vendors in urban areas are
 occasionally under age 14, more frequently during school
 vacations than at other times.
 e. -Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Under the labor code, the minimum annual paid vacation is 18
 days, and the legal workweek is 40 hours for nonagricultural
 employees and up to-48 hours per week for agricultural
 workers. In order to make room for younger workers, civil
 servants are encouraged to retire upon reaching the minimum
 retirement age of 55. Minimum monthly wages are set by the
 Government for all public and private sector jobs. Minimum
 wage rates, which range from $62 to $103 per month, are based
 -on geographic zones, types of industry, and worker seniority
 .and qualifications. The lowest wages are insufficient to
 'support a family, but usually are supplemented by a second job
 or another family member's earnings. Workers with
 middle-range wages also are likely to need second incomes to
 support a family, especially in Yaounde and Douala.
 Occupational safety and health is mandated by law, based on
 ILO standards. In theory, these standards are enforced by
 Ministry of Labor inspectors and. labor courts, but they lack
 the means for effective enforcement.
