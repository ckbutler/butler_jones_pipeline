 LIBERIA
 In 1994 Liberia remained a country increasingly divided factionally and geo-
 gaphically, even though warring factions did conclude an agreement in late Decem-
 ber on ending the country's civil war. The Liberian National Transitional Govern-
 ment (LNTG) was seated after much delay in March as the successor to the Interim
 Government of National Unity (IGNU), which along with the National Patriotic
 Front of Liberia (NPFL) and the United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Li-
 beria (ULIMO) signed the July 1993 Cotonou Peace Agreement under the aegis of
 the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the United Nations,
 and the Organization of African Unity. The Cotonou Accord did not, however re-
 solve the basic factional differences over political power or lead to the projected de-
 mobilization of the warring factions, or to planned free elections. In fact, the three
 groups that signed the Accord mushroomed to seven competing political-military
 grups which renewed factional fighting, thereby preventing the LNTG from extend-
 ing its authority outside greater Monrovia andthe corridor to Buchanan (see Sec-
 tions 1.g. and 3). Throughout much of the year, the shifting factional military action
 served to keep Charles Taylor's NPFL forces, which almost captured Monrovia in
 late 1992, on the defensive.
 In the confusing Liberian mosaic of political/military forces, an eighth group, com-
 posed of civilian political parties and other interest groups, convened a National
 Conference in August to pressure the armed factions to disarm and implement other
 Cotonou Accord provisions. The Conference strongly opposed a new agreement
 reached on September 12 in Akosombo, Ghana, by the Cotonou signatories, includ-
 ing the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) replacing the dissolved IGNU, under the aus-
 pices of ECOWAS Chairman Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings. The Conference
 participants insisted that the new accord excessively favored warring-faction inter-
 ests. While fighting raged in Liberia between followers of the faction leaders meet-
 
 
 133
 ing in Ghana, Rawlings continued to consult with the various Liberian parties, in-
 cluding the National Conference. Their leaders signed the Akosomb Clarification
 Agreement (three parties) and the Agreement of Acceptance and Accession (five par-
 ties including the National Conference) on December 21 in Accra. The Accra Ac-
 cords rovide for a cease-fire on December 28 and established a 5-member ruling
 council to be inaugurated in early 1995 to govern the country, including conduct the
 November 1995 elections, until an elected government takes over in January 1996.
 The key military force supporting the LNTG remained the ECOWAS Cease-Fire
 Monitoring Group (ECOMOG). At year's end, ECOMOG was composed of 6,000-
 8,000 troops--down from 12,000 in July-from six West African and two East Afri-
 can countries, although over half of the force was Nigerian. Initially a peacekeeping
 force, ECOMOG increasingly became the interim Government's de facto arm  and
 in addition, assumed many police powers within the Monrovia perimeter. ECOMOG
 was effective in its military role in maintaining relative calm within the Monrovia-
 Buchanan perimeter and for promptly putting down a September 15 coup attempt
 by a general from the ArmedForces of Liberia (AFL), who deserted in 1990, and
 dissident AFL supporters. Some ECOMOG soldiers have, however, also earned an
 unenviable reputation for a variety of illegal activities. ECOMOG reassigned several
 officers who were believed b outside observers to be engaged in activities detrimen-
 tal to the peae process    espite continuing criticism of ECOMOG behavior by
 human rights monitors, the majority of ECOMOG forces conducted themselves well
 during the year.
 The civil war-ravaged economy, previously based primarily on iron ore, rubber,
 timber, diamond, and gold exports, remainedstagnant. Continued disruption of eco-
 nomic activity, 80 to 90 percent unemployment across all sectors except government,
 massive displacements of civilians wanton destruction, and looting have all dev-
 astated theproductive capacity of Liberia despite its rich natural endowments and
 potential sel-ssufficiency in agriculture. Massive emergency operations by the United
 Nations, as well as by American and other Western-based relief agencies and non-
 governmental organizations (NGO's) continued throughout the year in ECOMOG-
 controlled areas. However, they were periodically suspended in other parts of the
 country because of fighting, harassment, and detention of relief personnel; looting
 of relief agency supplies and vehicles; and occasional seemingly arbitrary security
 restrictions imposed by ECOMOG.
 The number of human rights abuses unquestionably rose with the increased level
 of conflict across the country, including the massacre of over 65 civilians by incon-
 clusively identified attackers in a Monrovia suburb on December 15. There were
 many credible charges that all factions flagrantly disregarded fundamental humani-
 tarian values. Human rights monitors also criticized ECOMOG for incidents of
 human rights abuse. Since 1989, when Liberia's population was recorded at 2.4 mil-
 lion, an estimated 300,000 persons, most of them civilians, have been killed or
 wounded as a result of the conflict, and close to800,000 have taken refuge in neigh-
 boring countries. An estimated 1.1 million people have been displaced within Liberia
 since the war began. Approximately 130,000 Sierra Leonean refugees were also dis-
 placed repeatedly throughout the year, some landing finally within the safe haven
 of Monrovia. In all combat arenas, fleeing displaced persons reported villages looted
 and burned, use of excessive force; arbitrary detentions; impressment, particularly
 of children under the age of 18 into the NPFL and ULIMO-Mandingo forces; torture;
 individual and gang rape; summary executions- mutilations and cannibalism. In the
 absence of progress on disarmament and demobilization, the U.N. Observer Mission
 in Liberia (UNOMIL) began drawing down its 443-member staff in August. The
 fighting and looting became so ferocious in September that all humanitarian assist-
 ance outside the Tubmanburg-Monrovia-Buchanan perimeter was halted, although
 several NGO's resumed modest food deliveries into the interior in November and
 December. No progress was made in resolving outstanding incidents of past human
 rights abuses.
 Although obeisance was paid to the 1985 Constitution, the Penal Code, and the
 Labor Code, because of the violent conditions obtaining up country and the over-
 crowding and destitute conditions for a large percentage of people living in and near
 Monrovia, the rights provided by these documents were largely moot.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Indiscriminate killings increased
 sharply from the previous year. Although professing adherence to the rule of law,
 the leaders of the warring factions condoned and, in some instances, seemingly en-
 couraged the murderous savagery that affected the civilian population more than
 
 
 134
 the combatants (see Section 1.g.). Despite claims to be the national army, the AFL
 acted as a warring faction, and AFL troops frequently engaged in a variety of
 human rights abuses including alleged extrajudicial killings.
 Individual ECOMOG soldiers, serving a dual role as peacekeepers and peace en-
 forcers, committed several extrajudicial killings, such as the shooting death of a uni-
 versity professor on November 1 for running a checkpoint. The soldier was awaiting
 trial at year's end. In another case, ECOMOG court-martialed a soldier for killing
 a civilian and reportedly executed him. In contrast to the leaders of the warring fac-
 tions, the ECOMOG high command was committed to bringing soldiers involved in
 crimes against civilians to justice. There were no reports of ECOMOG soldiers com-
 mitting political killings.
 On March 21, a Turkish citizen convicted of murder reportedly died of starvation
 in the Monrovia central prison. There was a cursory investigation undertaken by
 the LNTG's National Security Agency, but the authorities took no action to punish
 those responsible for the prisoner's death. Inmates credibly accused the guards of
 stealing the food provided for prisoners.
 In the many killings committed by the warring factions, it was often impossible
 to sort out whether they were politically motivated or driven by tribal hatred. How-
 ever, the savage killing of a judge of Lofa County in January by the ULIMO-
 Mandingo faction appeared to have clear political intent (see Section 1.g.). There
 were also unconfirmed but credible reports of Muslim ULIMO-Mandingo fighters
 executing civilians in Lofa County for religious and ethnic reasons (see Section 5).
 There were no reports that factions punished fighters for politically motivated
 killings, but combatants of all factions were routinely executed for offenses in the
 eyes of their commanders, as in the case of Nixon Gaye, field commander of the
 largest NPFL unit. He was shot August 27 in his reported mutiny attempt against
 Charles Taylor and died of his injuries along with an unreported number of his sup-
 porters. Dissident NPFL cabinet ministers claimed Gaye was tortured to death after
 being wounded. Charles Taylor admitted on December 23 ordering the executions
 of several of his senior military commanders because of alleged connivance in the
 September loss of Gbarnga.
 b.Disappearance.-In the area under LNTGIECOMOG control, there were no
 known disappearances. NPFL and ULIMO-Mandingo forces were responsible for
 many unexplained disappearances, notably by impressment of children (see Sections
 5 and 6.d.). Many families remained divided among those living in Monrovia, those
 located in other parts of Liberia, and those who fled the country and have not yet
 returned. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has a family trac-
 ing program but, because of the inaccessibility of major sectors of the country
 throughout the year, located only a small percentage of the missing persons brought
 to its attention. In the wake of fighting in Bong and Maryland counties in Septem-
 ber and October, a new wave of approximately 200,000 refugees flooded into Guinea
 and Cote d'Ivoire. Many of these refugees were unable to contact family members.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 While the 1985 Constitution prohibits torture and other degrading treatment, inhu-
 man treatment continued to be frequent. In the greater Monrovia area under
 ECOMOG control, with a better educated populace, a freer press, the presence of
 national and international human rights and humanitarian aid groups, there were
 fewer reports of torture than in the past (see Section 1.d.). Although the Supreme
 Court ruled that "trial by ordeal" or "sassywood"--commonly, the placement of a hot
 metal object on a suspect's body to induce confession in a criminal investigation-
 is unconstitutional, the Ministry of Internal Affairs continued to employ licensed
 agents who subjected suspects to this practice. A leading Monrovia-based human
 rights rup brought suit in March seeking compensatory damages for injuries sus-
 tained by victims of the continuing practice of sassywood. Tribal courts, which use
 this traditional mode of justice, did not function because of the disruptions of the
 civil war.
 Eyewitnesses report that ECOMOG soldiers beat and humiliated persons at
 ECOMOG checkpoints in Monrovia, often for curfew violations. After ECOMOG de-
 tained prominent businessman and Unity Party stalwart Peter Bonner Jallah in No-
 vember 1992 for allegedly abetting the NPFL surprise attack against Monrovia, it
 released him in May. Jallah credibly claimed that ECOMOG and the preceding gov-
 ernment's intelligence officers had beaten him in the head with a gun butt, adminis-
 tered electrical charges to his body, burned him about the genitals with gasoline,
 and handcuffed him so tightly that he now suffers nerve damage in his hands (see
 Section 1.d.).
 NPFL fighters stripped, beat, and tortured civilians at numerous highway check-
 points in NPFL areas, usually in connection with extortion or other forms of intimi-
 dation. The NPFL reportedly detained and tortured two traditional chiefs who went
 
 
 135
 to NPFL headquarters in Gbarnga in August to convince Charles Taylor to send
 representatives to the National Conference in Monrovia.
 Roving bands of ULIMO-Krahn and ULIMO-Mandingo fighters raided villa.ges in
 Cape Mount and Bomi counties, pillaging, beating, raping, and murdering civilians
 as they went. There are similar documented reports of primarily Liberian Peace
 Council (LPC) depredations in the southeastern counties. On June 28 ULIMO-
 Krahn fighters attacked the UNOMIL regional headquarters in Tubmanburg, beat
 and tortured six U.N. observers, and completely looted-the headquarters.
 All warring factions regularly committed various forms of torture and mistreat-
 ment of civilians, including individual and gang rape and other violence against
 women.
 Conditions in government jails continued to be life-threatening. Officials fre-
 quently denied prisoners medical care, family contacts, and adequate food; cells re-
 mained small, crowded, and filthy. Female prisoners were held in separate cells in
 the central prison, but there were no separate facilities for juvenile offenders. In
 1994, however, the LNTG and ECOMOG regularly granted human rights groups ac-
 cess to prisoners in Monrovia, and these groups frequent  obtained needed medical
 treatment for their clients. In a number of cases, the pro no work of human rights
 groups and interested individuals resulted in the release of prisoners, especially
 those whose cases were pending "further examination."
 The conditions of detention outside Monrovia were even worse. When detained,
 prisoners were held in makeshift, substandard facilities and subjected to various
 rms of mistreatment, beth physical and psychological--including beatings, rape,
 and threatened executions. More often, however, displaced persons reported that
 "authorities" either let prisoners go or shot them on the spot.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The 1985 Constitution prohibits arbi-
 trary arrest and provides for the rghts of the accused, including warrants for ar-
 rests and the right of detainees either to be charged or released within 48 hours.
 In practice, police officers often disregarded these rights and made arbitrary arrests.
 Many police officers accepted bribes to arrest persons based on unsubstantiated alle-
 gations. At times they failed to inform detainees of the charges against them, and
 often charges went unrecorded. The LNTG Ministry of Justice moved to protect citi-
 zens' rights by issuing new procedural guidelines to the Bureau of Corrections, lim-
 iting the persons authorized to commit suspects to jail, and filing writs of dismissal
 for detainees who were not processed correctly.
 ECOMOG soldiers played the major role in policing the greater Monrovia area,
 and citizens continued to turn to ECOMOG soldiers rather than the unarmed police
 force to arrest and detain alleged criminals. Detentions by ECOMOG peacekeepers
 frequently did not satisfy internationally recognized standards, and there were
 unconfirmed reports that ECOMOG coerced confessions from suspects. ECOMOG
 did, however, regularly allow NGO's access to prisoners in its various detention cen-
 ters. As a result of politician Peter Bonner Jalla's 18-month detention without
 charge, the Center for Law and Human Rights Education filed a writ with the Su-
 preme Court calling for a definition of ECOMOG's arrest and detention powers. In
 its controversial September decision, the Supreme Court stated that ECOMOG "as
 a peacekeeping force has no legal right to arrest and detain any citizen." Toward
 ers end, EOMOG and various Liberian security and law enorcement agencies
 established a joint task force" intended to appropriately apportion responsibilities
 and overall security duties.
 Although the AFL claims to be the national army, ill-disciplined AFL troops fre-
 quently committed some of the most serious human rights abuses (see Sections l.a.
 and 1.g.). For example, on June 24, AFL soldiers entered the UNOMIL Demobiliza-
 tion Center at Schiefflin and detained the staff for 3 days after which they looted
 the Center. On September 15, under the direction of a U.S.-domiciled former AFL
 general, some AFL soldiers attempted a coup against the Government, seizing the
 executive mansion. ECOMOG forces swiftly put down the attempted coup and cap-
 tured leader Charles Julue, 78 AFL supporters, and 5 civilians. After a 3-week
 probe, ECOMOG released 40 soldiers and detained 38 for court-martial. It turned
 the five civilians over to the civilian judiciary. The trial of the five began on October
 14 but was suspended as of year's end because of procedural and security issues.
 The AFL court-martial of Julue, three other generals, and others began on Novem-
 ber 16 but suffered repeated delays due to security concerns caused by dissident
 AFL soldiers.
 While accurate arrest information was unavailable, charged and uncharged pre-
 trial detainees in the Monrovia area formed a sizable portion of the total incarcer-
 ated population. Human rights grups reported that approximately one-third to one-
 half of the prisoners (average 75) at any given moment at the Monrovia central pris-
 on compound had not been tried. Modest reforms within the court system, such as
 
 
 136
 limiting the time frame for argument, reduced somewhat the backlog of judicial
 cases. Except for the September coup suspects, there were no known political/secu-
 rity detainees in the Monrovia area under LNTG jurisdiction, but it was impossible
 to determine the number of such detainees elsewhere in the country.
 On April 5, ECOMOG released 800 NPFL fighters who had been held for over a
 year foloing their capture during the NPFLs October 1992 Operation Octopus"
 attack on Monrvia. UNOMIL, whch had been charged under the 1993 Cotonou
 Peace Accord with supervising a demobilization program, included the 800 in its ini-
 tial demobilization figure of 3,500.
 The NPFL committed repened arbitrary detentions in its territory where martial
 law has been in effect since the war began. NPFL fighters had almost unbridled
 power to make arrests without warrants. They exercsed that power often and capri-
 ciously, detaining persons, including U.N. military observers, on spurious grounds
 or without charge or  riods ranging from several hours to several weeks, as in the
 case in May of an AFL colonel held for I month. The NPFL held 350 orphans whom
 the NPFL abducted from Fatimah Cottage in October 1992, at Cuttington Univer-
 sity College until the fighting reached Gbarnga in September. At the height of the
 fighting, the children fled, with most of them joining the 150,000 displaced persons
 still held by the NPFL at year's end near Toteta. UNOMIL was able to evacuate
 58 of the orphans by helicopter before the security situation made flights impossible.
 There were no reports of iberians being subjected to forced political exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tral.-The court structure is divided into four levels with
 the Supreme Court at its apex. Under the 1985 Constitution, defendants have the
 due process rights conforming to internationally accepted norms of fair trial. Most
 of these rights, however, were ignored in practice.
 By 1994 all levels of the court system, which had been devastated by the years
 of civil war, were functioning in Monrovia although erratically. While corruption
 and incompetent handling of cases remained a recurrent problemsome progress was
 made in addressing problems in the judiciary, including requiring that circuit court
 judges be law school graduates. The 1994 LNTG budget included the judiciary for
 the first time in 4 years, which resulted in judges being given office facilities and
 vehicles. The Supreme Court, composed of justices nominated by the warring fac-
 tions, continued to operate.
 In addition to the resurrection of the modern court system, customary law was
 also applied in Monrovia. The Ministry of Internal Affairs subjected persons accused
 of occurt practices and other crimes to "trial by ordeal," submitting defendants to
 physical pain to adjudicate guilt or innocence (see Section 1.c.).
 In the case of two AFL soldiers whom a military court found guilty of murder,
 a leading human rights organization on their behalf appealed the death sentence
 to the Supreme Court. The AFL, claiming no appeal was permitted from a court-
 martial judgment, initially threatened to execute the prisoners but subsequently de-
 ed action after the Supreme Court issued a restraining order. By year's end, the
 Ministry of Defense had not constituted an appeal board.
 Although in 1991 the NPFL also partially reactivated the court system in areas
 under its control, legal and judicial protections have been almost totally lacking
 since then. In the areas controlled by the other factions, there was little pretense
 of due process; swift judgment was meted out by the faction leaders. Given the con-
 tinuing war, it was not possible to determine the total number of political/security
 detainees (see Section 1.d.) or political prisoners among the prisoners held by the
 factions.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-While
 the Constitution provides for these rights, there were many serious abuses of pri-
 vacy and home-including confiscation of property and failure to obtain required
 warrants--by the police and fighters of all the warring factions. According to the
 Constitution, the police must have a warrant or a reasonable belief that a crime is
 in progress, or is about to be committed, before entering a private dwelling. In prac-
 tice, the police engaged in forced entry without a warrant to carry out arrests and
 investigations.
 Combatants of all the warring factions looted villages during the year, with
 ULlMO-Krahn and ULIMO-Mandingo factions in Bomi and Cape Mount counties
 and LPC and NPFL fighters in southeastern counties and elsewhere drawing con-
 siderable public outrage. These forces pilfered virtually any item of value and regu-
 larly demanded scarce food and personal valuables from already impoverished resi-
 dents or displaced persons, often robbing them of their clothes and physically abus-
 ing them, particularly at checkpoints. Confiscation of private homes and vehicles
 was common practice.
 These factions also used forced entry for purposes of intimidation. For example,
 AFL soldiers made two raids on the Monrovia residence of a legislative representa-
 
 
 137
 tive to harass the representative for his support of the new police director. In one
 instance, an AFL soldier shot the representative's guard in the leg. The representa-
 tive sent a formal letter to the Transitional Legislative Assembly accusing four
 members of the AFL high command of attempted murder.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flict.-In 1994 the warring factions inflicted considerably more harm  on non-
 combatants than on each other. All factions indiscriminately ransacked villages and
 confiscated scant food supplies. They deliberately targeted, tortured, and murdered
 innocent civilians and regularly committed violence against women, children, and
 the elderly.
 The number and complexity of warring forces increased in 1994. In addition to
 Charles Taylor's NPFL in the central counties, the anti-NPFL ULIMO split in
 March into its two ethnic components, the ULIMO-Mandingo faction and the
 ULIMO-Krahn faction. While there was intra-ULIMO fighting in the western coun-
 ties, both ULIMO wings joined other groups, including the AFL, in fighting NPFL-
 Taylor forces in central Liberia. Made up of remnants of late President Samuel
 Doe's army, the AFL controlled pockets of terrain along the road to Buchanan and
 a few areas in and around the Firestone Plantation. The LPC, a predominantly
 Krahn group drawing major support from active and former AFL combatants,
 emergedin late 1993 and made serious inroads in 1994 against the NPFL in the
 south and eastern coastal region. Krahn ethnic loyalties closely linked the ULIMO-
 Krahn, the AFL, and the LPC. The Lofa Defense Force (LDF) provided sporadic
 challenge to ULIMO-Mandingo control of the northwest.
 The NPFL also suffered a schism. In August a trio of dissident NPFL ministers,
 who took their LNTG cabinet seats in April, declared Charles Taylor unseated as
 Chairman of the NPFL's Central Revolutionary Committee. They joined other splin-
 ter groups in an anti-Taylor coalition which artici ated with ULIMO-Mandingo
 forces in a successful September attack on Taor's Gbarnga headquarters which he
 reoccupied in December (see Section l.a.).
 There were many incidents throughout the year in which civilians died. On June
 9, LDF fighters reportedly massacred or summarily shot 75 civilians at Russie vil-
 lag near Zorzor in Lofa county. On June 22, ULIMO-Mandingos massacred nine
 civilians, including women and children, in Brewervile, Monterrado county. Wit-
 nesses confirmed that ULIMO troops questioned the victims about their tribal back-
 grounds and then killed or tortured them and threw their bodies into a well. In late
 August, ULIMO-Krhn fighters massacred between 20 and 30 persons in Gbesseh
 town, Cape Mount county. In September there were numerous reports of a "mas-
 _sacre by ULIMO-Manding fighters who attacked Phebe Hospital near Gbarnga,
 looting it and killing an unknown number of civilians, including several Phebe staff
 members. Subsequently, NPFL leader Charles Taylor implied the killings of civil-
 ians at Phebe had been committed by members of the NPFL. In mid-December,
 fighters of undetermined affliation attacked the Paynesvile suburb of Monrovia,
 shooting, hacking, and burning 66 civilians to death.
 Credible reports indicated that NPFL, ULIMO-Krahn, ULIMO-Mandingo, and
 LPC fighters committed acts of cannibalism. In some instances, the fighters ate spe-
 cific organs in the belief that it would make the fighter stronger. Human rigts
 groups estimated that _3 to 6 percent of combatants participated. Displaced persons
 reported see"n severed extremities and extracted body parts, such as the heart of
 a Lofa county judge displayed i the streets of Vojama after he was murdered by
 ULIMO-Manding forcs. Often, it was impossible to know where the victim came
 from or what had happened; on September 21, a diplomat came upon an unidenti-
 fied, naked and tortured corpse (pieces of rope on the deceased's wrist) along the
 main rad through a Monrovia suburb.
 The NPFL took credit for mining the Bong MineKakata Read, the feeder rads
 to the Monrvia-Buchanan Highway, and threatened to mine the Totota-Kakata
 Highway if anyone attempted to save the 150,000 displaced persons in Totota. Three
 mine explosions elsewhere killed several civilians andtwo ECOMOG soldiers.
 Relief organizations estimated that 1.1 million persons have been internally dis-
 placed since the war began. Most of these are dependent on humanitarian aid for
 survival. Upper Lofa county, for instance, where a $1 million staging base in Vahun
 had been gutted by    mO brigands in December 1993, remained bere      at of reief
 oprations throughout the year nuse the security situation was too unstable to
 allow relief workers to return. Fierce fighting in other sectors of the country ham-
 pered humanitarian work. Faction leaders and their followers, suspicious of the pos-
 sible supply of aid to the enemy, often refused to allow international and humani-
 tarian relief agencies access beyond their checkpoints to distribute food and sup-
 plies. U.N. and relief agencies reported continuous harassment and detention of
 
 
 their staffs, confiscation of vehicles, and looting of foodstuffs, medical supplies, and
 gasoline.
 In September interfactional warfare erupted in central Liberia with such renewed
 brutality that over 200,000 Liberians fled their homes, some to the bush and others
 into Guinea and the Ivory Coast. U.N. agencies and NGO's withdrew their up-coun-
 try staffs after the NPFL took 43 U.N. observers hostage in various sectors of NPFL
 territory and after millions of dollars of U.N. and humanitarian assistance supplies
 and equipment had been stolen. Assistance outside the Monrovia and Buchanan
 areas ground to a halt in September but resumed to a few locations at greatly re-
 duced levels late in the year.
 Various factions attacked ECOMOG peacekeeping forces throughout the year and
 on a number of occasions took ECOMOG soldiers hostage. At least eight ECOMOG
 soldiers lost their lives, and many were wounded. Similarly, the warring factions de-
 tained UNOMIL staff members and at times tortured them.
 ECOMOG soldiers also inflicted suffering on the civilian population. Individual
 soldiers committed a number of serious illegal activities, including systematic
 looting not only of small, easily transportable goods but also the stripping of entire
 buildings for scrap to be sold abroad. Credible reports indicated that members of
 ECOMOG facilitated the delivery of-if not delivering-weapons and ammunition to
 the AFI LPC, and ULIMO combatants fighting to dislodge Taylor's NPFL. Alleg-
 edly, some ECOMOG soldiers engaged in the illegal drug trade (heroin and cocaine)
 and used Liberia as a transit point for drugs coming in from Nigeria and Ghana
 for onward shipment. ECOMOG soldiers were also accused of using children as
 young as 8 years of age as prostitutes.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-These freedoms are provided for in the 1985
 Constitution and, with some significant limitations, citizens generally exercised
 these rights in Monrovia. Liberians are free to criticize the LNTG and ECOMOG,
 although they usually show restraint and self-censorship in favor of the temporary
 Governments.
 Due primarily to continued economic stagnation, the number of publications in
 Monrovia fluctuated from month to month. At year's end, there were eight privately
 owned newspapers in Monrovia. While a restrictive, Doe-era media law providing
 the Ministry of Information wide discretion in licensing and regulating journalists
 remained on the books, official press censorship was not pervasive in Monrovia.
 Also, there were no newspapers forcibly closed during the year. Reflecting local opin-
 ion, most of the Monrovia press tended to be anti-NPFL; and some journalists ad-
 mitted to self-censorship in favor of the interim governments.
 Other journalists asserted that public calls by IGNU and subsequently LNTG offi-
 cials for a 'more responsible" press had a chilling effect on journalistic freedom. At
 times, government officials and senior ECOMOG officers, offended by articles, in-
 sisted on meeting privately with journalists. Perhaps most chilling were the re-
 ported threats to individualjournalists by persons claiming to represent one or an-
 other of the warring factions. After a group of citizens from ULIMO territory pub-
 lished a statement in Monrovia that ULIMO should relinquish control of the west-
 ern counties to the LNTG, the ULIMO leadership threatened physical harm to jour-
 nalists who published articles making such suggestions.
 There was no overt general attempt to censor the press, such as the mid-1993 di-
 rective from IGNU that journalists submit all "war-related" stories to the Ministries
 of Information and Justice for clearance on national security grounds. At that time,
 the Press Union of Liberia (PUL) and newspaper publishers objected to the measure
 as a prior restraint, but the PUL and IGNU later compromised on guidelines for
 milita  reporting. Those guidelines continued in effect and undoubtedly constituted
 part the basis for self-censorship. Except when fighting became too widespread,
 international journalists were able to visit contested zones and to file reports with-
 out official censorship. Because of the fighting, journalists from Monrovia cannot re-
 port on events in NPFL areas, and vice versa.
 Outside Monrovia, residents of Liberia exercised extreme care in their criticism
 of the various factions. Although NPFL leader Charles Ta or affirmed publicly on
 several occasions his su pport of free speech, citizens in Vs area were subject to
 sanctions for criticizing the NPFL There were two pro-NPFL newspapers intermit-
 tently published in NFL territory, but no newspapers were printed in ULIMO-or
 LPC-controlled areas. Both NPFL papers were initially denied permission to cir-
 culate in Monrovia by the LNTG because they were not legally "registered." LNTG
 officials seized copies of one of the papers on at least one occasion.
 ECOMOG, IGNU, and subsequently the LNTG supported a radio station (ELBC)
 which broadcast progovernment (and at times sycophantic) programming through-
 
 
 139
 out 1994. Many credible journalists alleged substantial censorship of ELBC. A pri-
 vately owned radio station began broadcasting from Monrovia in October 1993 but
 limited its news and commentary in order to avoid _possible governmental inter-
 ference. The NPFL continued to operate intermittently at least one radio station,
 which uncritically supported Charles Taylor.
 The University of Liberia functioned throughout 1994 despite some delays caused
 by financial problems. Academic freedom was generally respected, although the uni-
 versity authorities and most of the student body criticized pro-NPFL expression.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights of peaceful assembly and association. ECOMOG, apparently with full
 IGNU agreement, imposed a nighttime curfew in Monrovia from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.
 after the NPFL attack in 1992; the curfew continued in force. ECOMOG soldiers en-
 forced the measure strictly and arrested numerous persons for noncompliance.
 ECOMOG periodically meted out corporal punishment to repeat curfew violators.
 The LNTG and ECOMOG permitted political parties and other groups to organize
 freely and hold public meetigs in Monrovia but ECOMOG did prohibit an outdoor
 peace rally in July and genera  discouraged parades or demonstrations for security
 reasons, The NPFL and ULIMO-Mandingo forces severely restricted freedom of as-
 sembly and association in their areas. In other factions' areas, residents felt intimi-
 dated and did not attempt demonstrations.
 c. Freedom of Religon.-The 1985 Constitution recognizes freedom of religion as
 a fundamental right, and Liberia has no established state religion. There was no
 evidence of systematic violation of religious freedom by warring factions, but there
 were isolated and sometimes violent incidents of religious repression by local fight-
 ers, especially by Muslim ULIMO-Mandingo forces (see Section l.a.).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement throughout Liberia
 as well as the right to leave or enter the country at will. ECOMOG monitored free-
 dom of movement at checkpoints within Monrovia and around its perimeter.
 Factional fighting interfered with freedom of movement, ranging from resettle-
 ment of displaced persons to ordinary commerce and travel. ECOM1OG restricted the
 movement of civilians, humanitarian aid and staffers at various times throughout
 the year. All factions impeded the movement of relief workers and supplies and ex-
 torted, humiliated, and harassed citizens at checkpoints and makeshift barricades.
 Of a total estimated population of almost 2.7 million at the end of 1994, approxi-
 mately 1.1 million Liberians have been internally displaced since 1990, and 776,000
 were refugees in neighboring west African countries, many out of fear of ethnic per-
 secution. The number of refugees fluctuated depending on the intensity and proxim-
 ity of the fighting to population centers. Many of the displaced went to Monrovia,
 including the 6,000 former refugees who returned to Liberia, reportedly because of
 the security and more reliable relief supplies.
 There were approximately 130,000 Sierra Leonean refugees in Liberia as the civil
 war spilled over into Sierra Leone. Many Sierra Leoneans suffered mistreatment by
 both ULIMO factions and the NPFL as they were displaced from camps in western
 counties and made their way to camps in Lofa county, where approximately 70,000
 reside, and camps in and around Monrovia.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Despite constitutional and statutory provisions for free and fair elections, Ibe-
 rians could not exercise the right to change their government. Implementation of
 the July 1993 Cotonou Accord and followup September 1994 Akosombo Agreement
 lagged as the factions continued to argue at year's end over the detailed arrange-
 ments and timetable for seating a new transitional government, disarmament, and
 demobilization. The December Akosombo Clarification Agreement postponed elec-
 tions until November 1995 and the installation of an elected government until Janu-
 he LNTG installed in March 1994 is a weak transition Government comprised
 of representatives of the signatories to the Cotnou Accrd-IGNU, NPFI and
 ULIMO. There is a 5-person Council of State appointed by the signatory factions,
 a 35-member Transitional Legislative Assembly (TLA) also appointed by the fac-
 tions, and the judiciary. At the end of the year, it remained to be seen whether the
 factions could implement the new LNTG called for in the December 21 Accra agree-
 ments.
 There are no restrictions in law on the participation of women in politics; in prac-
 tice, two women hold cabinet-level positions in the LNTG, and a few hold positions
 in the legislature and judiciary. Overall numbers of women in the LNTG and the
 various political parties are small.

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The interim governments have permitted domestic and international groups to op-
 erate freely. The few domestic human rights organizations are relatively new and
 underfunded but made progress improving their influence, visibility, and perform-
 ance.
 There were no domestic human rights organizations extant outside the ECOMOG-
 controlled areas due to the warn  factions hostility to such organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The 1985 Constitution prohibits discrimination based on ethnic background, race
 sex, creed, place of origin, or political opinion, but discrimination exists in fact and
 in some cases in law.
 Women.-The status of women varies by region, ethnic group, and religion. Before
 the outbreak of the civil war, women held one-quarter of the professional and tech-
 nical occupations available in Monrovia. Some women currently hold skilled jobs in
 government, including in the Cabinet legislature, and judiciary. On the whole, how-
 ever, the lot of women deteriorated dramatically with the onset of war, the closing
 of many schools, and the loss of their traditional role in production, distribution and
 sale of foodstuffs. In the past 3 years, several women's organizations formed in Won-
 rovia and Gbarnga to advance family welfare issues, to help promote political rec-
 onciliation, and to assist in rehabilitating former combatants as well as civilian vic-
 tims of war. In urban areas, women can inherit land and property. In rural areas,
 where traditional customs are stronger, a wife is normally considered the property
 of her husband and his clan and usually is not entitled to inherit from her husband.
 Women in most rural areas do much of the farm labor and have only limited ac-
 cess to education. In the massive violence inflicted on civilians during the conflict,
 women suffered the gamut of abuses (see especially Sections 1.c. and 1.g.). Even
 prior to the war, domestic violence against women was extensive, but the Govern-
 ment, the courts, the media and women's groups never seriously addressed the
 issue. There are several NG6's in Monrovia and Buchanan which have developed
 programs for treating abused women and girls and increasing their awareness of
 their human rights.
 Children.-In the civil war, the various sides have given almost no attention to
 the welfare of children, whose education and nurturing have been seriously dis-
 rupted. Many who were disabled, orphaned, abandoned, or "lost" during a military
 attack on their homes or villages, reportedy accepted the protection and sustenance
 that joining a faction brought. Both The NPFL and the ULIMO-Mandingos recruited
 and trained children as cooks, spies, errand runners, guards, and in many instances
 combatants. There were no precise figures on the number of child soldiers, but some
 sources estimated that 10 percent of the 40,000 to 60,000 combatants are under 15
 years of age. Many children are substance abusers and depend upon the factions
 for supply. As a result, children have become both victims and abusers in the con-
 flict. any suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder. Some NGO's have initiated
 small retraining and rehabilitation programs for a limited number of former child
 fighters (see Section 6.d.).
 International health experts have condemned female genital mutilation (FGM),
 including clitoridectomy, as physically and psychologically damaging to the girls and
 young women on whom the operation is performed. In some instances, female health
 professionals in the tribes have successfully participated in the ceremony to the ex-
 tent of providing hygienic conditions and postoperative care. FGM is practiced pri-
 marily on young girls by northern, western, and central tribes, particularly in rural
 areas and among traditional societies. According to an independent expert in the
 field, the percentage of Liberian females who have undergone this procedure may
 be as high as 60 percent. Although there was one newspaper report of a failed at-
 tempt to force a girl in Monrovia to undergo the procedure, it was difficult to con.
 firm the extent to which this procedure was practiced in 1994 by Liberia's uprooted,
 displaced, and often inaccessible population. The most extreme form of FGM,
 infibulation, is notpracticed in Liberia.
 National/Racial[Ethnic Minorities.-Although the Constitution bans ethnic dis-
 crimination, it also provides that only "persons who are negroes or of negro descent"
 may be citizens or own land, thus denying full rights to many who were born or
 lived most of their lives in Liberia. There has been no legislative initiative to repeal
 this racial test. The 1975 Economic "Liberianization" Law prohibits foreign owner-
 ship of certain businesses, such as travel agencies, retail gasoline stations, and beer
 and soft drink distributors. This law resulted in the rejection of several foreign-
 owned business proposals.

 The roots of the civil conflict can be found in the historical division between the
 Americo-Liberian minority, who, despite representing less than 5 percent of the pop-
 ulation, for over 150 years dominated the political, economic, and cultural life of the
 country, and the indigenous ethnic groups. The latter frequently complained of gov-
 ernment discrimination in many areas, such as access to education and civil service
 jobs and to infrastructure development.
 The authoritarian military-based regime established after the 1980 coup mounted
 by Sergeant Doe and other AFL noncomissioned officers progressively exacerbated
 ethnic tensions while subverting the democratic reforms embodied in the 1985 Con-
 stitution. During the Doe regime, resentment grew over domination of government
 by Doe's ethnic group, the Krahns, which reprsent approximately 4 percent of the
 population. Throughout the civil war, the factions have used an individual's lan-
 guage to identify ethnicity and ofte summarily executed those from groups consid-
 ered hostile. The UIMO faction split in March along Krahn-Mandingo lines and
 fought each other and the NPFL. The NPFL, supported by the Gio and Mano
 groups, waged war against four preponderantly ethnically constituted factions, three
 of them Krahn: The predominately Krahn AFL troops in and around Monrovia, the
 Krahn LPC along the southern coast and north into (Krahn) Grand Gedeh county,
 and the ULIMO-Krahns in Bong county. The ULIMO-Mandingos made incursions
 against the NPFL in Bong county and from early September until December held
 control of Gbarnga, the NPFL stronghold (see Section ILg.).
 Religious Minorities.-While the law prohibits religious discrimination, there were
 claims of discrimination in practice. Some Muslims, who represent a growing share
 of the population, believe that Liberia's secular culture gives preference to Chris-
 tianity in civic ceremony and observances, and that discrimination spills over into
 areas of individual opportunity and employment. The Muslim education system
 stresses religious as opposed to skills-based learning. As a result, the authorities
 frequently by-passed Muslims for the highly sought-after technical and bureaucratic
 jobs avail able in government. In addition, many Liberian Muslims believe that their
 access to jobs and rles in public life is restricted by an anti-Muslim bias in many
 sectors of Liberian society with a predominately Christian orientation.
 People With Disabilities.-The protracted civil war has produced a large number
 of persons with permanent injuries in addition to persons disabled from other
 causes. There is no legal discrimination against the disabled, but in practice they
 do not enjoy equal access to education, employment, and scant social services. There
 are no laws mandating accessibility to public buildgs or services.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1985 Constitution states that workers, except
 military and police, have the right to associate in trade unions (see also Section
 6.b.). However, as with virtually all other organized activity in the country, unions
 disappeared during the height of the 1989-90 war. With the signing of the July
 1993 Cotonou Peace Accord, many industries planned to resume, and affected
 unions began reorganizing and attempting to locate members. However, union ef-
 forts to reorganize generally faltered in 1994 as factional fighting increased. The
 most active organization was the Ship Workers' Union.
 The 1985 Constitution is silent on the right to strike. While the Labor Code pro-
 vides for this right, the Doe government issued a no-strike decree in 1980. Govern-
 ments up to 1990 intimidated labor officials, assuring a generally docile work force
 and labor environment. Neither of the subsequent IGNU and LNTG legislative as-
 semblies repealed or afirmed the no-strike decree, which was not challenged in
 1994 as there were no strikes. During the year, the LNTG took no discriminatory
 actions against organized labor.
 In 1990 the US. Government suspended Liberia's eligibility for trade benefits
 under the Generalized System of Preferences because of its violations of worker
 rights.
 Labor unions have traditionally affiliated freely with international labor groups.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively-With the important exception
 of civil servants, workers (including employees of public corporatio ns and autono-
 mous agencies) have the right to organize and bargain collectively. In the past, labor
 and employers negotiated agreements freely thout government interferene. In
 1994 these rights were largely moot because of the lack of economic enterprise, espe-
 cially in Monrovia, where only a few businesses resumed operations, usually with
 reduced staffing. There were no formal mechanisms in place for resolving com-
 plaints of discrimination against union workers.
 There was no activity in Liberia's one export processing zone (EPZ) which has
 been inoperativ   e  990when fighting reachedtheeo        of Monrovia. When
 operational, labor laws have the same force in the EPZ as elsewhere in the country.
 
 
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor, but even before the civil war local authorities widely ignored this prohibition
 in rural areas where farmers were pressured into providing free labor on "commu-
 nity projects," which often benefited only local leaders. The warring factions used
 forced labor during the fighting, especially for moving equipment or supplies. Ac-
 cording to credible reports, ULIMO-Mandingo fighters also used Sierra Leonean ref-
 ugees to acquire food for them, occasioning the flight and repatriation of approxi-
 mately 5,000 Sierra Leoneans from Vahun, Lofa county.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Under the Doe government, the
 law prohibited employment of children under age 16 during school hours in the
 wage sector. This law is still technically in effect, but there is no enforcement. Even
 earlier, enforcement by the Ministry of Labor was limited, and small children con-
 tinued to assist their parents as vendors in local markets and on family subsistence
 farms. This practice persisted in 1994, particularly in those areas where school had
 been closed because of the war. Dur*     the onflict the NPFL and ULIMO-
 Mandingos recruited young children as soldiers, many of whom had been orphaned;
 some were less than 12 years of age. Many of these children, especially in the
 NPFL, remained under arms in 1994 (see Section 5).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code provides for a minimum wage,
 paid leave, severance benefits, and safety standards. Before the economy collapsed,
 the legal minimum wage varied according to profession but did not generally pro-
 vide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. (The minimum wage for
 agricultural workers was approximately 90 cents per day, with industrial workers
 receiving three or four times that amount.) Often workers were forced to supple-
 ment their incomes through other activities to maintain a minimal standard of liv-
 ing. Those not displaced turned to subsistence farming. The minimum wage was not
 enforced adequately by the Ministry of Labor.
 The Labor Code provides for a 48-hour, 6-day regular workweek with a 30-minute
 rest period for every 5 hours of work. The 6-day workweek may extend to 56 hours
 for service occupations and to 72 hours for miners, with overtime pay beyond 48
 hours. In view of the low level of economic activity during 1994, most employers ig-
 nored these various regulations, and there was very little attempt at enforcement
 in the country.
 Prior to 1990, there also had been government-established health and safety
 standards, enforced in principle by the Ministry of Labor. Workers did not have a
 legal right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations.
