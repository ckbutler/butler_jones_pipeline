 LIECHTENSTEIN
 The Principality of Liechtenstein is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary
 democracy whose present Constitution dates back to 1921. The reigning Prince is
 the Head of State. All legislation adopted by the unicameral legislature (Landtag)
 must have his concurrence. The Government, whose members are appointed by the
 Prince in agreement with the Landtag on the latter's proposal, is responsible for the
 entire administration of the State.
 The Principality's police force maintains internal order and is aided by a part-time
 auxiliary police force. Both organizations are under the control of the elected Gov-
 ernment, -and they respect human rights.
 Despite its small size (population 29,386, of which over one-third are foreigners)
 and limited natural resources, Liechtenstein has developed during the last three
 decades from a rural agrarian society into a prosperous, highly industrialized, free
 enterprise economy with an important service sector. Through a 1923 treaty, it par-
 ticipates in a customs union with Switzerland and uses the Swiss Franc as its na-
 tional currency. Unemployment is virtually nonexistent, and Liechtenstein enjoys
 one of the highest standards of living in the world.
 Individual human rights are provided for in the Constitution and protected in
 practice. As it has become increasingly involved in international forums during the
 past decade, Liechtenstein has demonstrated a strong interest in and commitment
 to the protection of human rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and other Extrajudicial Killing There is no history of politically moti-
 vated killings, and none is known to have occurred in 1992.
 b. Disappearance.-There have been no known abductions, secret arrests, or clan-
 destine detentions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and cruel punishment are prohibited by law, and there have been no reports
 of violations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Freedom from arbitrary arrest and de-
 tention is provided by law and observed in practice. The rules of evidence and proce-
 dure applied by the courts are to a great extent based on Austrian models. Any per-
 son detained by the authorities must appear before an examining magistrate not
 later than 24 hours after arrest. The magistrate must either state formal charges
 or release the prisoner. The right to legal counsel is guaranteed. If the accused can-
 not afford representation, the State provides the cost of defense. Release on personal
 recognizance or bail is granted unless the examining magistrate believes the person
 is a danger to society or will not appear for trial. There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for public trials. There
 is a procedure for judicial appeal, and the judiciary is separated from the executive
 and legislative branches. Liechtenstein has a three-tier system of courts: Lower
 Court, High Court, and Supreme Court. The Constitution also provides for an ad-
 ministrative court which hears appeals against any government decisions. A state
 court which protects the rights accorded in the Constitution, decides on conflicts of
 jurisdiction between the law,courts and the administrative authorities and acts as
 a disciplinary court for members of the Government. There are no political pris-
 oners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for personal liberty, immunity of the home, and inviolability
 of letters and telephone conversations, including freedom from wiretaps. Police need
 a judicial warrant to search private property. No violations were reported.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-An independent press, effective judiciary. and
 democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and press. There
 are two newspapers, each representing the interests of one of the two major political
 
 
 830
 parties. There are no television or radio broadcasting facilities within the Principal.
 ity, but residents freely receive radio and television broadcasts from neighboring
 Switzerland, Austria, and Germany, and many are also cable television subscribers.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of assembly and asso-
 ciation is protected by the Constitution and observed in practice. Although permits
 must be obtained for public meetings and demonstrations, they are routinely given.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Liechtenstein enjoys religious freedom. The state church
 is Roman Catholic, and 87 percent of the population practice that faith. Other de-
 nominations are entitled to practice their faiths and to hold religious services. For-
 eign clergy are free to perform their duties in Liechtenstein.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Liechtenstein citizens have the freedom to travel in or outside the coun-
 try and can emigrate without difficulty. There is no restriction on repatriation of
 Liechtenstein citizens abroad.
 Since Liechtenstein has no airport or international train station, it is not a coun-
 try of first asylum. The few applicants for asylum are returned to the authorities
 of one of the two neighboring countries of entry, Switzerland and Austria. Refugees
 and asylees are not forced to return to countries in which they fear they would be
 persecuted.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The monarchy is hereditary in the male line. The unicameral legislature, compris-
 ing 25 deputies, is elected by the people every 4 years by proportional representa-
 tion. The Constitution provides for the right to vote, which is universal, equal, se-
 cret and direct. A coalition of the two major political parties has formed the Govern-
 ment since 1938. Although there are some historical differences between these two
 parties, as well as disagreements over some local issues, a high degree of political
 consensus exists, and the rights of emerging opposition and splinter groups are re-
 spected. The electorate regularly makes use of its right to participate in initiatives
 and referendums. Women gained the right to vote in national elections in 1984.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The only known human rights group based in Liechtenstein, Justitia, is an infor-
 mal group of three or four persons who monitor prison conditions and assist foreign
 workers with immigration matters. They do so without government restriction.
 There have been no requests for the investigation of human rights violations.
 Liechtenstein has consistently cooperated with international and nongovernmental
 groups in all areas of human rights and has demonstrated a particular interest in
 and support for human rights and minority rights in international organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 There is no legal discrimination on the basis of race, language, or social status.
 On August 14, a constitutional amendment for the first time provided for equality
 to women under the law. Laws governing citizenship and residency rights, social se-
 curity and unemployment insurance, education, taxation, and conditions in the
 workplace are under revision to bring them into compliance with the August 14
 Constitutional Amendment. Additionally, legislation to give women equal pay for
 equal work is presently under review. Several groups monitor and promote women's
 rights. They report that the Government is cooperative with respect to their con-
 cerns and in some cases provides financial support. The social and traditional dis.
 crimination which still persists hinders opportunities for women in fields that have
 been traditionally dominated by men. Wife beating is prohibited by law. Liech-
 tenstein has facilities through which women who are victims of violence may obtain
 help and counseling.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Ail workers, including foreign workers in Liech-
 tenstein, have the freedom to associate, join the unions of their choice, and select
 their own union representatives. The existing social peace, in part due to the high
 standard of living, has resulted in a low demand for organized worker represents.
 tion. The one trade union comprises 13 percent of the work force but looks after the
 interests of nonmembers as well. It is free to affiliate internationally but does not.
 Workers have the right to strike, except in certain work categories, as outlined
 in work contracts and agreed to by the employees concerned. No strikes are known
 to have taken place in the last 25 years.

 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides workers the
 right to organize and bargain collectively. This right is recognized for all professions.
 However because Liechtenstein enjoys the world's highest per capita income for a
 state without oil resources, and, because wealth is well distributed, the right is rare-
 ly exercised.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law and does not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The employment of children under
 the age of 15 is prohibited. Children are required to remain in school for 9 years.
 Child labor laws are enforced by the Government, and adolescent workers are pro-
 vided special protection by law.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage; wages
 are among the highest in the world. Liechtenstein law sets the standard workweek
 at 46 hours in industrial firms- and 50 hours in nonindustrial firms. In practice the
 average workweek is between 40 and 41 hours. Workers under the age of 20 receive
 a minimum of 5 weeks of vacation; after the age of 20, they receive a minimum of
 4 weeks.
 Occupational health and safety standards are set by law, and they protect the
 worker in the workplace. A safe working environment is enforced by the Depart-
 ment for Worker Safety. The trade union also monitors working conditions. There
 were no allegations of worker rights abuses.
