 AZERBAIJAN
 Azerbaijan is a republic with a presidential form of government. Heydar Aliyev,
 who assumed presidential powers after the overthrow of his democratically elected
 predecessor in 1993, was reelected in October in a controversial election marred by
 numerous, serious irregularities, violations of the election law, and lack of trans-
 parency in the vote counting process at the district and national levels. President
 Aliyev and his supporters, many from his home region of Nakhchivan, continue to
 dominate the Government and the multiparty 125-member Parliament chosen in the
 flawed 1995 elections. The Constitution, adopted in a 1995 referendum, established
 a system of government based on a division of powers between a strong presidency,
 a legislature with the power to approve the budget and impeach the President, and
 a judiciary with limited independence. The judiciary does not function independently
 of the executive branch and is corrupt and inefficient.
 After years of interethnic conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, Armenian
 forces and forces of the self-styled "Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh" (which is not
 recognized by any government) continue to occupy 20 percent of Azerbaijan's terri-
 tory. A cease-fire was concluded in 1994, and the peace process continues. Ex-
 changes of fire occurred frequently along the Azerbaijan-Armenian border and along
 the line of contact with Nagorno-Karabakh causing casualties, including some civil-
 ians. Military operations continued to affect the civilian population. There are
 800,000 Azerbaijani refugees and internally displaced persons (IDP's) who cannot
 return to their homes. In the part of Azerbaijan that Armenians control, a heavily
 militarized ruling structure prevents ethnic Azerbaijanis from returning to their
 homes. In the part of Azerbaijan that the Government controls, government efforts
 to hinder the opposition continue to impede the transition to democracy.
 Police, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Ministry of National Security are
 responsible for internal security. Members of the police committed numerous human
 rights abuses.
 Azerbaijan continued economic reform in 1998 and the economy is in transition
 from central planning to a free market. Economic growth has been spurred by sub-
 stantial foreign investment in the hydrocarbon sector, but it is offset by a highly
 organized system of corruption and patronage. The country has rich petroleum re-
 serves and significant agricultural potential. Oil and oil products are the largest ex-
 port, followed by cotton and tobacco. Other key industries are chemicals and oil field
 machinery. The Government signed 5 oil production sharing agreements with for-
 eign oil companies in 1998, bringing the total to 14. Agriculture employs 33 percent
 of the labor force and contributes 20 percent to the gross domestic product (GDP).
 The leading crops are wheat, fruit and vegetables, cotton, tobacco, and grapes. Pri-
 vatization of industry continues through auction sales of small- and medium-sized
 state-owned enterprises. Large enterprises remain almost exclusively under govern-
 ment control and operate at a fraction of their capacity. Accumulation of large wage
 arrears is common. Private retail enterprises, cotton gins, and grain mills are pro-
 liferating. About 90 percent of the nation's farmland is now in private hands, but
 new small farmers have poor access to credit and markets, and commercial agri-
 culture remains weak. Per capita GDP is approximately $500 per year. Much of the
 labor force is employed by the state sector where wages are low. The overall eco-
 nomic situation of the average citizen remains tenuous, although in urban areas a
 growing moneyed class with trade and oil-related interests has emerged. According
 to the World Bank, 60 percent of the citizens live in poverty. Economic opportunity
 for the average citizen still depends largely on connections to the Government. Se-
 vere disparities of income have emerged that are partly attributed to patronage and
 corruption.
 The Government's poor human rights record improved in a few areas, but govern-
 ment actions toward the end of the year negated some of the positive developments,
 and serious problems remain. Police beat persons in custody, arbitrarily arrested
 and detained persons, and conducted searches and seizures without warrants. In
 most instances, the Government took no action to punish abusers, although per-
 petrators were prosecuted in a few cases. In a variety of separate incidents, the Gov-
 ernment arrested and opened criminal proceedings against approximately 40 mem-
 bers of opposition parties. Prison conditions remained harsh. The judiciary is cor-
 rupt, inefficient, and subject to executive influence. Corruption continued to pervade
 
 
 1132
 most government organs, and it is widely believed that most persons in appointed
 government positions and in state employment generally purchase their positions.
 The Government holds an estimated 75 political prisoners. The Government in-
 fringed on citizens' privacy rights. The Government eased restrictions on freedom
 of speech and the press. After open discussion in the press, the Government abol-
 ished censorship in Augst. Scores of opposition and independent newspapers con-
 tinued to publish and discuss a wide range of sensitive domestic and foreign policy
 issues. However, the Government cracked down on the media later in the year in
 the postelection period. The Government continued to deny broadcast licenses to
 several organizations applying to open independent television and radio stations.
 The Government restricted freedom of assembly, association, religion, and move-
 ment when it deemed it in its interest to do so. Police suppressed or refused to allow
 many peaceful public demonstrations, while allowing others to occur. Opposition po-
 litical parties carried on open and vigorous public activities in the months leading
 up to the election. In August-September, the Government allowed a number of pub-
 lic demonstrations, and closed its criminal investigation of eight prominent figures
 from opposition parties. After these positive steps, the Government clamped down
 on freedom of assembly after the election. The Government tolerated the existence
 of many opposition political parties, although it continued to refuse to register some
 of them. The Government continues to restrict citizens' ability to change their gov-
 ernment peacefully. Although the Government passed an improved election law, the
 presidential election was marred by many irregularities, and a number of inter-
 national and independent organizations concluded that it did not meet international
 standards. The Government was critical of certain domestic human rights activists,
 although it was open to limited dialog with domestic and international human
 rights organizations. Societal discrimination and violence against women and dis-
 crimination against certain ethnic minorities are problems.
 Cease-fire violations by both sides in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict continued.
 They resulted in injuries and deaths among combatants and civilians, and the tak-
 ing of prisoners, including civilians. Insurgent Armenian forces in Nagorno-
 Karabakh and the occupied territories continued to prevent the return of IDP's to
 their homes. This restriction resulted in significant human suffering for hundreds
 of thousands of persons.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 There has been no action by the Government in the killing of opposition Azer-
 baijan Popular Front Member of Parliament Shakhmerdan Jafarov in July 1995.
 Three police officers were convicted and given prison sentences ranging from 6 to
 7 years for fatally assaulting detainee Jamal Aliyev in 1994 in order to force a con-
 fession.
 There have been no further confirmed developments in the cases of the death of
 Firuz Gurbanov in August 1997, after which a police official was arrested, or in the
 death of Samir Zulfugarov in Baku in August 1997 where a police official reportedly
 was under investigation in connection with the death.
 Cease-fire violations by both sides in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict resulted in
 the death and injury of civilians.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 All sides to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict still detain prisoners. The Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) visited 11 persons held in relation to
 this conflict, 6 held by Azerbaijan, and 5 held by Nagorno-Karabakh authorities.
 Azerbaijan holds both soldiers and civilians. The ICRC repeatedly asked the con-
 cerned parties for notification of any person captured in relation to the conflict, ac-
 cess to all places of detention connected with the conflict, and release of all such
 persons. The ICRO also urged the parties to provide information on the fate of per-
 sons reported as missing in action. The Government has presented to the ICRC a
 list of 856 persons allegedly held by the Armenians, but there was no information
 on further revision of the list during the year.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture is illegal; however, there are credible reports that the police practice of beat-
 ing prisoners during arrest, interrogation, and pretrial detention was widespread.
 On at least three occasions, police or other government officials beat journalists
 (see Section 2.a.).
 Prison conditions are harsh. The quality of food, housing, and medical care is
 poor. Prisoners must rely on their families to procure food and medicine. There are
 
 
 1133
 
 widespread and credible reports that authorities deny or give inadequate medical
 treatment to prisoners with serious medical conditions. Authorities severely limit
 opportunities or exercise and visits by family members of prisoners in security pris-
 ons.
 The family of Kenan Gurel convicted of participating in a coup attempt continues
 to report that he was receiving inadequate medical treatment.
 Human rights organizations were able to visit prisons on several occasions. How-
 ever, the Government continued to deny the ICRC access to prisons except those
 where persons held in relation to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict were detained.
 Various embassies have petitioned the Government for permission to visit all pris-
 ons. In general the Government denies access to detainees held in security prisons
 that hold both high risk common criminals and high risk persons sentenced for
 crimes with a political connection, for example, persons sentenced in connection
 with coup attempts and military mutinies.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Authorities arbitrarily arrest and detain
 persons without legal warrants. Often authorities do not notify family members
 after arrests. Frequently, it is days before family members are able to obtain infor-
 mation as to whether authorities have arrested someone and where authorities are
 holding the detainee. Family members do not enjoy the right of visitation. Authori-
 ties generally deny bail to detained individuals and often do not inform detainees
 of the charges against them. There is no legal protection concerning the right of de-
 tainees to be charged or released within a certain period of time, or for accused per-
 sons to receive an expeditious trial. Access to lawyers is often poor. In the past, po-
 lice sometimes detained relatives of suspects being sought in an attempt to force the
 family to reveal a suspect's whereabouts (see Section if.).
 During the year, police arrested at least 40 members or supporters of opposition
 parties who were participating in peaceful demonstrations. All were released, but
 21 had criminal charges lodged against them that were still pending at year's end.
 Police also briefly detained journalists (see Section 2.a.).
 The Government continued to harass parties critical of the Government by arbi-
 trarily arresting party members, including close associates of opposition party lead-
 ers. The Government arrested an aide to the chairman of the Popular Front Party,
 accusing him of illegal possession of a pistol and hand grenade that independent ob-
 servers believe were planted. It arrested two other associates of the Popular Front
 Party chairman at a demonstration in November. The Government continues to de-
 tain without charge a deputy director of a state oil refinery previously run by Rasul
 Guliyev, a former chairman of the Parliament now living abroad whom the Govern-
 ment accuses of large-scale embezzlement. The detainee's family claims that he has
 a heart condition and was being denied adequate treatment. The actions taken
 against some of Guliyev's relatives were politically motivated. At year's end, the po-
 litical detainees also included the nephew of Rasul Guliyev.
 At year's end, an aide to opposition leader Isa Gambar was still detained for polit-
 ical reasons and had not been brought to trial. A relative of Gambar, previously de-
 tained for political reasons and charged with failure to notify the Government of a
 crime was convicted and sentenced to 3 years in prison (see Section i.e.).
 The Government does not practice forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for a judiciary with lim-
 ited independence; however, notwithstanding constitutional provisions for judicial
 independence, judges do not function independently of the executive branch. The ju-
 dicial system is subject to the influence of executive authorities and has been widely
 seen as corrupt and inefficient. The President appoints Supreme and Constitutional
 Court judges, subject to confirmation by Parliament. The Government established
 the Constitutional Court and appointed judges to it. The President directly appoints
 lower level judges with no requirement for confirmation.
 Courts of general jurisdiction may hear criminal, civil, and juvenile cases. District
 and municipal courts try the overwhelming majority of cases. The Supreme Court
 also may act as the court of first instance, depending on the nature and seriousness
 of the crime.
 The Government organizes prosecutors into offices at the district, municipal, and
 republic level. They are ultimately responsible to the Minister of Justice, are ap-
 pointed by the President, and confirmed by Parliament. The Constitution prescribes
 equal status for prosecutors and defense attorneys before the courts. In practice,
 however, prosecutors' prerogatives still outweigh those of defense attorneys. Inves-
 tigations often rely on obtaining confessions rather than obtaining evidence against
 suspects. No judge has dismissed a case based on a prisoner's claim of having been
 beaten.
 Cases at the district court level are tried before a panel consisting of one judge
 and two lay assessors. The judge presides over and directs trials. Judges frequently
 
 
 1134
 send cases unlikely to end in convictions back to the prosecutor for "additional in-
 vestigation." Such cases may be either dropped or closed, occasionally without in-
 forming either the court or the defendant.
 The Constitution provides for public trials except in cases involving state, com-
 mercial, or professional secrets,- or matters involving confidentiality of personal or
 family matters. The Constitution provides for the presumption of innocence in crimi-
 nal cases and for numerous other rights, including an exclusionary rule barring the
 use of illegally obtained evidence and for a suspect's right to legal counsel, to be
 informed immediately of his legal rights, and of the charges against him. However,
 the Government has not made significant efforts to enforce these rights throughout
 the criminal justice system. Defendants may confront witnesses and present evi-
 dence. The court appoints an attorney for indigent defendants. Defendants and pros-
 ecutors have the right of appeal. The Government has generally observed the con-
 stitutional provision for public trial. Foreign and domestic observers generally were
 able to attend trials.
 Opposition political parties and NGO's credibly estimate that the Government
 held about 75 political prisoners at year's end, a reduction apparently reflecting a
 combination of releases of some prisoners in a general amnesty and completion of
 jail sentences for others. The Government continues to assert that it holds no politi-
 cal prisoners.
 Nonetheless, the Government continued to convict and imprison persons for politi-
 cal reasons. For example, the Government sentenced a student member of the Popu-
 lar Front Party to 18 months in prison. The student authored a document outlining
 a strategy of popular resistance to the Government that police retrieved from a com-
 puter hard drive, but the document was never published and the party disavowed
 -it. The Government used the document to launch a 3-week media campaign against
 opposition parties in May and June. On June 2, a military court sentenced three
 persons, two of them members of a political party affiliated with former parliamen-
 tary speaker Rasul Guliyev (see Section 1.d.) that the Government has refused to
 register, to terms of 9, 5, and 2 years' imprisonment for falsely accusing the Min-
 ister of the Interior of trying to entrap them in a plot against the President. A court
 sentenced a relative of Musavat party chairman Isa Gambar to 3 years in prison
 for allegedly failing to inform -authorities of a crime.  I
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government infringed on these rights. The Constitution provides for secrecy of cor-
 respondence and telephone conversations, subject to limits provided by law in crimi-
 nal investigations or in prevention of a crime. The Constitution allows searches of
 residences only with a court order or in cases provided by law. However, citizens
 widely believe that the Ministry of National Security monitors telephones, especially
 those of foreigners and prominent political and business figures. Police often con-
 ducted searches without a warrant, and investigations sometimes resulted in confin-
 ing the individuals to their city of residence or a brief jail sentence for questioning.
 There were credible allegations that police continued to intimidate and harass fam-
 ily members of suspects. There were credible reports that individuals linked to oppo-
 sition parties were fired from their jobs (see Section 2.b.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press and specifically outlaws press censorship; however, the Government
 in some cases did not respect these rights in practice. The Government gradually
 eased press censorship and then abolished censorship in August. Nonetheless, gov-
 ernment actions created an atmosphere in which journalists exercised self-censor-
 ship. Prominent politicians criticized the Government without reprisal; however, in
 one case, former president Elchibey, was charged with slander after he accused the
 President of having helped organize a terrorist organization during the Soviet era.
 The charges were dropped in early 1999.
 While the press debated a wide variety of sensitive topics for part of the year, a
 limited form of censorship somewhat restricted the public's ability to be informed
 about and discuss political issues. Most newspapers are printed in the Government's
 publishing house. Until August they had to submit their copy to government cen-
 sors. However, the censors tended to be inconsistent in exercising their power to
 prevent publication. The Government~s near monopoly of publishing facilities and its
 control over the price of newsprint gave it leverage over the press, a critical matter
 given the precarious finances of most opposition newspapers. In April the- Cabinet
 issued new licensing requirements for all print and broadcast media, but the en-
 forcement and effect of this measure was not clear at year's end.
 In February police, citing no legal authority, seized all remaining issues of the
 monthly magazine Monitor from newsstands, claiming, along with other government
 
 
 1135
 officials, that an article in that issue contained material insulting to the Azerbaijani
 nation. Three individuals then sued the magazine for defaming the Azerbaijani na-
 tion. The court awarded a punitive fine on the magazine exceeding that demanded
 by the prosecution, which has since prevented the magazine from publishing. In ad-
 dition, according to the Human Rights Watch annual report, in April the Minister
 of Internal Affairs sent journalists from the Monitor a letter demanding that they
 retract an article on torture published in the February issue that police ad seized.
 In November senior government officials brought libel suits and demanded large pu-
 nitive damages against the two largest opposition newspapers for articles they
 claimed were defamatory. The court decided against the newspapers, but as of year's
 end, the newspapers were appealing their cases; no fines had been paid; and no
 newspapers were closed.
 Police or other government officials beat a journalist in February. According to the
 Committee to Protect Journalists, police attacked 34 journalists as they were report-
 ing on an opposition rally in Baku on September 12 and also attacked 4 journalists
 as they were protesting peacefully the defamation trial against Yeni Musavat on No-
 vember 13.
 There were no further developments in the beating of a journalist in 1996. In
 1997 the investigation was reported as continuing, but no charges had been brought.
 The independent and opposition press played an active, influential role in politics.
 Articles critical of government policy and high government figures, including the
 President, and discussing sensitive areas of domestic and foreign policy, appeared
 routinely in the opposition and independent print media. Newspapers and broadcast
 media openly discussed censorship itself prior to its abolition.
 A large number of newspapers continued to publish. One reliable source put the
 number of registered newspapers at 375, and the number actually publishing at
 nearly 100. These included independent newspapers and newspapers with links to
 major and minor opposition parties. Government-run kiosks and independent news
 distributors distributed opposition and independent newspapers.
 However, the Government tightly controlled official radio and television, the
 source of information for much of the population. Opposition parties had virtually
 no access to the official electronic media, except for television spots for registered
 presidential candidates during the election campaign. The Government periodically
 used state television to conduct campaigns of denunciation and harassment against
 political parties and leaders critical of the Government. There are a limited number
 of private television stations, whose broadcasts can be received only in Baku or in
 local areas outside the capital. Independent radio, preferred by the overwhelming
 majority of listeners, is largely entertainment oriented, but one independent station
 airs political topics, although news is only a small portion of its program.
 Government newspapers made a number of references to the ethnic affiliation
 (Jewish) of the director of the Azerbaijani service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Lib-
 erty (RFE/RL) in the context of criticizing RFL/RL for unbalanced coverage of events
 in the country (see Section 5).
 The Ministry of Justice continued to deny registration to 15 independent tele-
 vision stations, 13 of which did not broadcast. Six independent television stations
 operate in Baku and other regions. Four of six independent television stations oper-
 ating outside of Baku were ordered to close; they are now rebroadcasting but with-
 out frequency licenses. Several foreign television stations and radio programs are
 rebroadcast locally through Azerbaijani facilities and are seen and heard in most
 parts of the country. The Government shut down for 2 weeks the local retrans-
 mission of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in April; however, broadcasts were also
 available on short-wave bands during the shutdown. There are no restrictions on
 reception of foreign stations via satellite. The Government granted no new broadcast
 licenses this year, despite several applications that remained pending. Of the three
 stations licensed since 1993, one television station is aligned with the Government,
 and one television and one radio station are entertainment oriented.
 The Government has limited Internet access by licensing only two Internet pro-
 viders and denying transmission licenses to several others.
 Appointments to government-controlled academic positions are heavily dependent
 on political connections. Nevertheless, several professors with tenure are active in
 opposition parties. There were no complaints of violation of academic freedom or of
 censorship of books or academic journals.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of'assembly; however, the Government restricts this right when it decides
 that it is in its interest to do so. Authorities frequently prevented political parties
 critical of the Government from conducting indoor congresses and meetings as well
 as outdoor gatherings. However, the Government eased these restrictions beginning
 in May as preparations began for the October presidential elections and allowed lim-
 
 
 1136
 ited freedom of assembly. The Government permitted opposition parties and presi-
 dential candidates to organize some rallies but cited questionable security consider-
 ations to divert the rallies from the sites of their choice. It refused to allow other
 demonstrations. In August, for example, the Government allowed the opposition to
 hold a rally but insisted that it take place on the outskirts of Baku rather than in
 the downtown area as rally organizers had requested. Police briefly detained- over
 300- persons proceeding to the rally or who engaged in unsanctioned pickets of gov-
 ernment buildings associated with the rally.
 In November the Government reapplied serious restrictions on freedom of assem-
 bly in the context of opposition parties' contesting the results of the flawed presi-
 dential elections. The crackdown began following a November 6 speech by President
 Aliyev in which he warned the opposition to act within constitutional limits (see
 Section 3). Police used force to disperse a peaceful, opposition demonstration on No-
 vember 7, after denying the participants permission to hold the demonstration.
 Seven participants in that rally were tried on criminal charges and given suspended
 sentences. The Government gave a permit for another opposition rally on November
 8 that proceeded peacefully until unknown persons attacked rally leaders. Four par-
 ticipants in that Tally were arrested and sentenced to jail terms of up to 3 years;
 10 others were convicted and received suspended sentences. None of the attackers
 has been arrested, despite the fact that the faces of the attackers apparently were
 recorded on film. The Government permitted no more public demonstrations during
 the remainder of the year. On November 13, the Parliament passed a law on public
 assembly giving authorities wide latitude to regulate and ban demonstrations. Au-
 thorities used the law to deny permits for several demonstrations by parties critical
 of the Government on the grounds that they would "disrupt stability" or threaten
 .public order. Police dispersed demonstrations on at least 2 occasions in September
 and November by force and-briefly detained over 100 persons participating in those
 demonstrations.
 The Government provides for freedom of association; however, it restricted this
 right when it decided that it was in its interest to do so. The Government requires
 political parties to register. There are over 30 registered political parties. Some of
 these are affiliated with or support the President's party. At least 10 registered par-
 ties are considered opposition parties. There are at least three opposition parties
 that the Government continued to refuse to register. The Supreme Court, without
 explanation, reversed its 1997 ruling that the Azerbaijan Democratic Party should
 be registered. Nevertheless, unregistered political parties continued to function
 openly, and members of unregistered political parties can run for president but
 must be sponsored by a registered party or an independent "voters initiative group."
 Members of unregistered parties may run for Parliament, but only as independents
 in a direct constituency, not on a party list. A party must be registered to run a
 list of candidates.
 Reports of harassment, including beatings, of political figures continued. There
 were credible reports that individuals linked to opposition parties were fired from
 their jobs. The Government did not return the Popular Front's headquarters nor
 many of its regional offices, which were seized in 1993.
 Explicitly ethnically or religiously based parties were prohibited from participat-
 ing in past elections.
 The Government generally allowed private- associations to function freely. The
 Ministry of Justice requires private organizations to register but did not grant this
 registration freely and expeditiously. It denied or unduly delayed registration for
 numerous private voluntary organizations, including three private human rights or-
 ganizations. Nevertheless, unregistered associations functioned openly.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution allows persons of all faiths to practice
 their religion without restrictions, and the Government respects this provision in
 practice for Shi'a and Sunni Muslims, Russian Orthodox Christians, and Jews; how-
 ever, a law on foreigners and stateless persons contains language that prohibits reli-
 gious "propaganda" by foreigners. This provision was reinforced by a presidential de-
 cree in 1997. There is no state religion. The law on religion subordinates all Islamic
 religious organizations to the Azerbaijan-based Spiritual Directorate of Caucasus
 Muslims. This law also permits the production, importation, and dissemination of
 religious literature only with the agreement of local government authorities. In one
 case, officials stopped the importation of a shipment of religious literature by a pri-
 vate individual not associated with a local congregation. The Ministry of Justice re-
 quires that religious congregations be.registered. It continued to deny registration
 to a foreign Christian group but allowed it to continue to function during the year.
 Registration enables a religious organization to maintain a bank account legally,
 rent property, and generally to act as a legal entity. Lack of registration makes it
 harder, but not impossible, for a religious group to function.
 
 
 1137
 Non-Orthodox Christian groups complained credibly of official harassment. Police
 in July detained approximately 40 persons belonging to the Word of Life religious
 group after they held a religious meeting in a private apartment Nine Azerbaijanis
 and three foreign nationals were found guilty of holding an "illegal religious gather-
 ing" and were fined. One of the foreigners was expelled from the country. During
 1996 and 1997, articles appeared in progovernment and independent newspapers
 crudely depicting non-Orthodox Christian missionary groups as a threat to the na-
 tion; however, in 1998 the number of such articles declined to near zero. Because
 of anti-Armenian sentiment and the forced departure of most of the Armenian popu-
 lation, Armenian churches remained closed. The Jewish community has freedom to
 worship and conduct educational activities and, during the year, enjoyed the public
 support of the Government.
 There was no further action in the 1997 case where an official in the Baku city
 prosecutor's office struck two Jehovah's Witnesses during questioning. Although the
 official was dismissed from the case, no action was taken against him.
 There is some evidence of strong prejudice against ethnic Azerbaijanis who have
 converted to Christianity. Some government bias against foreign missionary groups
 persists. Nevertheless, a number of these groups continue to function.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to choose freely their
 place of domicile and to travel abroad and return, and the Government generally
 respects these provisions, although at times it limited the movement of members of
 opposition parties. Residents of border areas in both Azerbaijan and Iran travel
 across the border in this restricted zone without visas. Foreigners and citizens re-
 quire a visa to travel to the Autonomous Republic of Nakhchivan. In the past, there
 were reports that local officials denied passports to members of the Armenian mi-
 nority (see Section 5).
 In August the Government ended a criminal investigation and lifted an associated
 travel ban, which had been in effect for several years, against eight members of op-
 position parties, including Musavat party chairman Isa Gambar and Musavat party
 deputy chairman Sulheddin Akper. Until August these persons were prohibited from
 traveling outside the capital. Former president Elchibey was prevented from travel-
 ing outside Baku for approximately 2 months while under investigation and on trial
 for insulting the President; the charges were dropped in early 1999.
 The Government officially recognizes freedom of emigration. Jewish emigration to
 Israel is unrestricted. However, with the majority of those who wish to emigrate al-
 ready having left, the number of Jewish emigrants is now small. The remaining Ar-
 menian population in Azerbaijan (other than Armenians residing in the Nagorno-
 Karabakh region of Azerbaijan) is approximately 10,000 to 20,000, mostly persons
 of mixed descent or in mixed marriages. While official government policy is that eth-
 nic Armenians are free to travel, low-level officials seeking bribes have harassed Az-
 erbaijani citizens of Armenian origin wishing to emigrate or obtain passports.
 There were no draft notifications that restricted movemefit during the year. Draft-
 age men must obtain documents from military officials before they can leave for
 international travel.
 The number of refugees and internally displaced persons from the Nagorno-
 Karabakh conflict is approximately 800,000. Armenians have settled in parts of the
 occupied territories. However, Armenians have not allowed the hundreds of thou-
 sands of Azerbaijanis who were forced out of the now-occupied territories to return
 to their homes. The Government provides almost no assistance to these persons,
 who rely on donations from foreign countries. Most of these internally displaced per-
 sons continue to live in camps and other temporary shelters, often at below-subsist-
 ence levels, without adequate food, housing, education, sanitation, or medical care.
 The parties to the conflict have cut normal trade and transportation links to the
 other side, causing severe hardship to civilians in Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia, and
 the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan.
 The Constitution provides for political asylum consistent with international
 norms. The Government is receptive to international assistance for refugees and in-
 ternally displaced persons. It cooperates with international organizations to provide
 aid for them. The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in as-
 sisting refugees. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise. There were
 no reports of the forced expulsion of persons with a valid claim to refugee status.
 The case of the two Iraqi refugees ordered to leave in 1996 remained pending at
 year's end awaiting refugee processing to travel to a third country.
 
 
 1138
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change-Their Govern-
 ment
 In theory the election law and Constitution allow citizens to change their Govern-
 ment by peaceful means; however, the Government continues to restrict -citizens'
 ability to change their government peacefully by interfering in elections.
 Azerbaijan is a republic with a strong presidency, and a legislature that the Con-
 stitution describes as independent. However, in practice the legislature's independ-
 ence from the executive is marginal. The Parliament exercises little legislative ini-
 tiative independent of the executive. Asa result of the flawed 1995 parliamentary
 elections, the New Azerbaijan Party led by President Aliyev, along with other par-
 ties and nominally independent deputies loyal to the President, occupy the over-
 whelming -majority of seats in the 125-member Parliament. Parties considering
 themselves as belonging to the opposition hold 14 seats. Opposition parties contin-
 ued to be active outside the Parliament, agitating for their views in their news-
 papers and through public statements. However, the Government continued to deny
 registration to at least three opposition-parties (see Section-2.b.).
 The 1995 Constitution required the formulation of a municipal election law and
 the holding of municipal elections by November 1997. However, municipal elections
 were not held by the constitutionally- mandated date and, as of year's end, such a
 law still had not been passed. The Government now has promised to hold municipal
 elections in 1999. -
 Parliamentary by-elections in July were marked by multiple- voting by heads, of
 families and ballot stuffing. The Government annulled the result in one district due
 to the high level of fraud.
 In preparation for the October presidential election, the Government amended the
 election law to take broad account of recommendations of international organiza-
 tions, including the OSCE. However, the Government took limited account of the
 international community's advice on election commissions. The OSCE/ODIHR final
 report noted that the law addressing the central election commission "influenced the
 entire structure and performance of the election administration" and undermined
 public confidence "in the election process and its integrity.".
 Five would-be opposition presidential candidates cited the belief that the election
 would not be fair-and that the election commissions would notbe impartial and boy-
 cotted the election. However, one moderate opposition leader and four other can-
 didates ran against the incumbent president.
 The October 11 presidential election was an improvement over the July by-elec-
 tions, especially in regard to reduced multiple voting and the presence of domestic
 observers. However, some domestic and international observers witnessed ballot
 stuffing and irregularities in vote counting, and some were barred from observing
 the vote counting. Neither domestic nor international observers were allowed to
 monitor the compilation of the national vote totals. The observed irregularities and
 lack of transparency in vote counting led to serious doubts about the accuracy of
 the 76 percent of the vote officially recorded for President Aliyev. International ob-
 servers, including the OSCE/ODIHR, concluded that the election did not meet inter-
 national standards.
 Courts did not give serious consideration to the complaints filed by runner-up
 E'tibar Mammedov, who charged that the President did not receive the necessary
 two-thirds vote to avoid a run-off. The Central Election Commission did not publish
 vote totals of election districts within the time period required by the election law,
 and by year's end, it had not published vote totals for election precincts, as pre-
 scribed by the election law.
 During and prior to the election campaign, the Government took a number of
 steps to improve the election and overa  political environment. In addition to the
 Government's amending the election law, it abolished press censorship (see Section
 2.a.), ended the criminal investigation of certain opposition figures (see Section 2.b.),
 allowed the opposition to conduct some rallies, and gave registered opposition presi-
 dential candidates access to state broadcast media. On the other hand, state media's
 reporting on the election was biased heavily in favor of the President. The Central
 Election Commission and local commissions were insufficiently representative and
 did not function impartially. The Government did not fully respect freedom of as-
 sembly (see Section 2.b.). The Government did not carry out the constitutional man-
 date to conduct municipal elections. Furthermore, after the presidential election, as
 the opposition contested the validity of the election, the Government reversed course
 and allowed no more public demonstrations and launched several lawsuits against
 opposition and independent newspapers (see Sections 2.a. and 2.b.).
 There are no legal restrictions on women's participation in politics. However, tra-
 ditional social norms restrict women's roles in politics. In past elections, and in the
 July parliamentary by-elections, in a practice known as family voting, men often
 
 
 1139
 cast the votes of their wives and other female members of their families. In the Oc-
 tober presidential election, this practice was seen less often. There are 11 female
 Members of Parliament and 2 women with ministerial rank.
 There are no restrictions on the participation of minorities in politics as individ-
 uals. However, explicitly ethnically or religiously based parties were prohibited from
 participating in past elections (see Section 2.b.). Members of indigenous ethnic mi-
 norities such as Talysh, Lezghis, and Kurds occupy some senior government posi-
 tions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several human rights organizations monitor the human rights situation in the
 country. For the most part, the Government posed no objections to international
 human rights groups. Some of these groups investigate human rights abuses and
 disseminate their findings through the media. However, the Government has been
 critical of certain domestic human rights activists who have raised politically sen-
 sitive issues.
 The Government has demonstrated a limited willingness to discuss human rights
 problems with international and domestic nongovernmental organizations (NGO's).
 The ICRC has had access to prisoners of war as well as civilians held in relation
 to the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. However, the ICRC has requested and been
 denied access to prisoners not related to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict being held
 in special security and other prisons.
 Government officials occasionally criticize human rights activists. The chief pros-
 ecutor threatened the chairman of the Azerbaijan Human Rights Center, Eldar
 Zeynalov, with criminal prosecution if he continued to claim that Azerbaijan held
 political prisoners. Zeynalov's organization continues these claims about political
 prisoners, and he has faced no legal action.
 A government newspaper in one case accused a representative of a human rights
 NGO of being a "foreign spy."
 The Ministry of Justice continued to deny registration to several local human
 rights NGO's, but the Government has not tried to halt their activities. Registration
 enables a human rights organization to maintain a bank account legally, rent prop-
 erty, and generally to act as a legal entity. Lack of registration makes it harder,
 but not impossible, for a human rights group to function.
 The ICRC conducted education programs on international humanitarian law for
 officials of the Ministries of Interior and Defense, and for university and secondary
 school students.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal rights without respect to gender, race, nation-
 ality or national origin, religion, language, social status, or membership in political
 parties, trade unions, or other public organizations. However, in the wake of the
 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, there is widespread anti-Armenian sentiment in society.
 Preventing discrimination is not a major government priority.
 Women.-Discussion of violence against women is a taboo subject in Azerbaijan's
 patriarchal society. In rural areas, women have no real recourse against violence by
 their husbands, regardless of the law. Rape is severely punishable, but, especially
 in rural areas, oniy a small fraction of offenses against women are reported or pros-
 ecuted. Police statistics note 41 cases of rape in the first 9 months of the year. These
 figures probably reflect underreporting, especially from the conservative rural areas.
 There are no specific laws concerning spousal abuse or spousal rape.
 Women nominally enjoy the same legal rights as men, including the right to par-
 ticipate in all aspects of economic and social life. In general women have extensive
 opportunities for education and work. However, traditional social norms continue to
 restrict women's roles in the economy. Representation of women is sharply lower in
 higher levels of the work force. There are few women in executive positions in lead-
 ing economic enterprises.
 Eighteen women s NGO's are registered and deal with the problems of women.
 The Association for the Defense of Rights of Azerbaijani Women spends most of its
 time fighting uniquely post-Soviet problems. It has helped divorced women, widows,
 and wives whosehusbands are in prison, all of whom have become socially and le-
 gally vulnerable since the fall of the Soviet Union. It assisted widows whose land-
 ords privatized their apartments and then evicted them. It also worked with di-
 vorced women who feel treated unfairly by divorce-courts.
 Children.-The Constitution and laws commit the Government to protecting the
 rights of children to education and health. Difficult economic circumstances limit the
 
 
 1140
 
 Government's ability to carry out these commitments. Education is compulsory, free,
 and universal until the age of 17. The Constitution places children's rights on the
 same footing as those of adults. The Criminal Code prescribes severe penalties for
 crimes against children. The Government provides minimum standards of health
 care for children, although the quality of medical care overall has fallen significantly
 since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Government has authorized subsidies for
 children in an attempt to shield families against economic hardship in the wake of
 price liberalization. The subsidies do not come close to covering the shortfall in fam-
 ily budgets, and the Government does not have the financial means to meet its com-
 mitments. There are a large number of refugee and displaced children living in sub-
 standard conditions in refugee camps and public buildings. Children sometimes beg
 on the streets of Baku and other towns.
 There is no known social pattern of abuse of children.
 People With Disabilities.-The law on support for the disabled, enacted in 1993,
 prescribes priority for invalids and the disabled in obtaining housing, as well as dis-
 counts for public transport, and pension supplements. The Government does not
 have the means in its current financial crisis to fulfill its commitments. There are
 no special provisions in the law mandating accessibility to buildings for the dis-
 abled.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The outbreak of hostilities and anti-Arme-
 nian riots in the final years of-the Soviet Union led to the expulsion of many Arme-
 nians and the departure of others. An estimated 10,000 to 20,000 Armenians still
 live in Azerbaijan, mostly in mixed Azerbaijani-Armenian families. Some have
 changed their nationality, as reported in their passports, to Azerbaijani. With the
 nearly complete departure of the Armenian population, the number of problems re-
 ported by this ethnic minority has'decreased. Armenians have complained of dis-
 crimination in employment and harassment at schools and workplaces and of re-
 fusal of local government authorities to grant Armenians passports or pay pensions.
 Armenian widows have had permits to live in Baku revoked. However, some persons
 of mixed Arnenian-Azerbaijani descent continue to occupy government positions.
 There are credible reports that ethnic Russians experience societal discrimination.
 Indigenous ethnic minorities such as the Talysh, Lezghis, Avars, and Georgians
 do not suffer discrimination. However, Meskhetian Turks displaced from Central
 Asia as well as Kurdish displaced persons from the Lachin region complain of dis-
 crimination.
 Jews do not suffer from discrimination, and the country is remarkably free from
 anti-Semitism. However, in a few isolated cases, government officials or those allied
 with the Government have used veiled anti-Semitic comments against perceived op-
 ponents for politically motivated reasons. For example, government newspapers
 made a number of references to the ethnic affiliation (Jewish) of the director of the
 Azerbaijani service of Radio Liberty in the context of criticizing Radio Liberty for
 unbalanced coverage of events in the country (see Section 2.a.).
 In the area of the country controlled by insurgent (Armenian) forces, the Arme-
 nians forced approximately 550,000 ethnic Azerbaijanis to flee their homes. The re-
 gime that now controls these areas effectively has banned them from all spheres of
 civil, political, and economic life.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Most labor unions still operate as they did under the
 Soviet system and remain tightly linked to the Government. The Constitution pro-
 vides for freedom of association, including the right to form labor unions. However,
 one or another subbranch of the government-run Azerbaijani Labor Federation orga-
 nizes most industrial and white-collar workers. Most major industries remain state-
 owned.
 An independent union of oil workers that was displaced by a progovernment
 union in 1997 has not been revived. In 1997 the state oil company formed a
 progovernment union, the Azerbaijan Union of Oil and Gas Industry Workers, which
 took over the former independent oil workers union without a vote of the union
 membership. It continues to operate without a vote of its rank and file workers. An
 independent group of oil workers, the Committee to Defend the Rights of Azer-
 baijani Oil Workers, operates outside of established trade union structures and pro-
 motes the interests of workers in the petroleum sector.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike, and there are no legal restric-
 tions on strikes or provisions for retribution against strikers. After a history of wild-
 cat strikes in the oil industry in which some striking workers were fired, there were
 no reported strikes in that sector during the year. Oil workers continue to demand
 restoration of Wage arrears amounting to several months pay. They do so internally
 
 
 1141
 
 but not through public protest. There are no established mechanisms to avoid wild-
 cat strikes.
 Unions are free to form federations and to affiliate with international bodies; how-
 ever, none has done so.
 b, The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-A law passed in 1996 pro-
 vides for collective bargaining agreements to set wages in state enterprises. A labor
 inspectorate was established in 1997. However, these laws have not produced an ef-
 fective system of collective bargaining between unions and enterprise management.
 Government-appointed boards and directors run the major enterprises and set
 wages. Unions effectively do not participate in determining wage levels. In a carry-
 over from the Soviet system, both management and workers are considered mem-
 bers of the professional unions.
 There are no export processing zones. Although there has been a United Nations
 Development Program-supported effort under way to create an economic zone in
 Sumgait since 1995, Parliament has not considered legislation to create such a zone.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor,-The Constitution allows forced or
 compulsory labor only under, states of emergency or martial law or as the result of
 a court decision affecting a condemned person. The Government has not invoked
 this clause. Two departments in the General Prosecutors Office (the Department of
 Implementation of the Labor Code and the Department for Enforcement of the Law
 on Minors) enforce the prohibition on forced or compulsory labor. There are no con-
 stitutional provisions or laws specifically prohibiting forced and bonded labor by
 children, but such practices are not known to occur. There were no reports during
 the year of compulsory cotton picking by children or adults.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum employment age is 16 years. Primary school education is compulsory, free, and
 universal. Children are normally in school until the age of 17. The law allows chil-
 dren between the ages of 14 and 15 to work with the consent of their parents and
 limits the workweek of children between the ages of 14 and 16 to 24 hours per
 week. Children at the age of 15 may work if the workplace's labor union does not
 object. There is no explicit restriction on the kinds of labor that 15-year-old children
 may perform with union consent. The Labor and Social Security Ministry has pri-
 mary enforcement responsibility for child labor laws. With high adult unemploy-
 ment, there have been few, if any, complaints of abuses of child labor laws. The Gov-
 ernment does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded-labor by children, but such
 practices are not known to occur (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets the nationwide adminis-
 trative minimum wage by decree. It is $3.00 (12,500 manat) per month. The wage
 is not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. The
 recommended monthly wage level to meet basic subsistence needs was estimated to
 be $80 (310,000 manat). Since most persons who work earn more than the minimum
 wage, enforcing its low level is not a major issue in labor or political debate.
 The disruption of economic links with the rest of the former Soviet Union contin-
 ues to affect employment in many industries. Idle factory workers typically receive
 less than half of their former wage. Under these conditions, many workers rely on
 the safety net of the extended family. More workers and unemployed persons turn
 to second jobs and makeshift employment in the informal sector, such as operating
 the family car as a taxi, selling produce from private gardens, or operating small
 roadside shops. Combinations of these and other strategies are the only way for
 broad sectors of the urban population to reach a subsistence income level.
 The legal workweek is 40 hours. There is a 1-hour lunch break per day and short-
 er breaks in the morning and afternoon. The Government attempts to enforce this
 law in the private sector of registered private businesses, but does not enforce these
 rules in the informal sector where the majority of citizens make their living.
 Health and safety standards exist, but they usually are ignored in the workplace.
 Workers cannot leave dangerous work conditions without fear of losing their jobs.
