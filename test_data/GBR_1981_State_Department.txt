 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 The United Kingdom plays a leading role in the development of
 democratic institutions and human rights practices. Its legal
 tradition and respect for individual rights are widely and
 justifiably admired. Both the British people and their
 governments continually seek to maintain and improve the high
 quality of human rights practices domestically and to promote
 higher levels internationally. These long-established
 traditions are daily put to the test in Northern Ireland, where
 the British government strives to combat terrorist violence --
 the most significant human rights problem in the UK -- and to
 maintain public safety against a background of a sharply
 divided society. This is the context of much of the discussion
 which follows.
 The United Kingdom provides a large and comprehensive social
 welfare program for the population. Public policy, supported
 by legislation, opposes discrimination on the basis of
 religion, race, sex or political opinion. However, recent
 outbreaks of rioting in various urban centers have raised
 questions concerning the police relationship with young people
 and ethnic minorities.
 1.     Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The use of torture is forbidden both by international and
 domestic law. First, the United Kingdom is a signatory to the
 European Convention on Human Rights, article 3 of which
 prohibits the use not only of torture but also of
 ill-treatment categorized as inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment. Second, domestic criminal law prohibits any
 unjustifiable assault against the person, no matter what its
 source.
 In 1971, the Republic of Ireland brought a case against the
 United Kingdom before the European Commission on Human Rights,
 alleging that British security forces in Northern Ireland were
 responsible for ill-treatment of persons suspected of being
 terrorists and detained under Northern Ireland emergency
 legislation. After four years of investigation, the commission
 concluded that some of the allegations set forth in the Irish
 suit concerning torture and inhuman or degrading treatment had
 merit. The Irish government, because it believed it had not
 received full satisfaction on all points of its case, then
 referred the case to theEuropean Court of Human Rights which,
 in a January 1978 decision, rejected the specific charges of
 torture, but found that use of sensory deprivation
 interrogation techniques by British security forces in Northern
 Ireland had constituted a breach of article 3 of the convention
 in that-it amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 In June 1978, Amnesty International issued a report of its
 mission which visited Northern Ireland from November 28 to
 December 6, 1977. The mission was primarily concerned with
 allegations made to the Commission by persons under
 interrogation as suspected terrorists. On the basis of
 surveying 78 cases out of 3,444 involving suspected terrorists
 processed by the police in 1977, Amnesty International
 concluded that maltreatment had taken place "with sufficient
 frequency to warrant the establishment of a public inquiry to
 investigate it".
 
 (900)
 
 901
 After publication of the Amnesty International report, the
 secretary of state for Northern Ireland stated that the British
 government did not authorize and would not condone the
 ill-treatment of persons held in custody. He noted that the
 chief constable of Northern Ireland had pledged that such
 ill-treatment would be dealt with in accordance with law.
 Amnesty International subsequently declined to submit its
 evidence on the ground that it had pledged confidentiality to
 its sources.
 On June 16, 1978, the British government established an
 independent committee of inquiry, chaired by Judge B.G.
 Bennett, to consider police practice and procedures in Northern
 Ireland relating to interrogation. The committee report issued
 on March 16, 1979 listed 66 separate 'major conclusions and
 recommendations" designed to improve the police interrogation
 system and protect prisoners against ill-treatment and
 policemen against false allegations. The British government
 accepted all of the committee's recommendations on police
 practices and procedures, and these have been implemented in
 virtually every aspect. They include closed-circuit TV in
 interviewing rooms, greater access to counsel, and closer
 supervision of interrogators by their superiors.
 Official statistics reveal a general downward trend in
 complaints of mistreatment in recent years. The figures in the
 first row below refer to persons held for questioning under
 either the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1978,
 the Prevention ofTerrorism (1976) Act, or section 2 of the
 Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) of 1967:
 1976      1977      1978      1979       1980

 The drop both in numbers and in percentage of complaints from 1977
 to 1980 (the most recent year for which statistics are available)
 reflects several factorst the reforms implemented as a result of the
 European proceedings and Bennett Committee findings, the cessation
 of exploratory mass arrests, and the generally lower level of
 violence.  (However, there was an upsurge in terrorist violence in
 1981.)
 Beginning in 1972, the British government granted special category
 status to prisoners in Northern Ireland serving sentences for
 terrorist offenses. All prisoners convicted of terrorist crimes --
 Republican and Loyalist -- were thereafter put into segregated
 compounds where they wore their own clothes, did no prison work, and
 were responsible for their own internal discipline. In November
 1975, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland announced that
 persons convicted of terrorist crimes committed after March 1976,
 would be treated as common criminals, but those who already had
 "special category status' would be allowed to serve out their
 sentences accordingly. Loyalist and Official Irish Republican Army
 prisoners convicted after the cutoff date at first would not
 
 
 902
 acknowledge the new rule, but then dropped their opposition.
 However, prisoners convicted of terrorist-type offenses who were
 members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army or of the Irish
 National Liberation Army refused to accept the denial of their
 special category status or to abide by prison regulations regarding
 such matters as clothing, work routines and personal hygiene. Male
 prisoners at the Maze Prison and, after February 1980, female
 prisoners at Armagh Prison, carried out a "dirty protest", wearing
 only prison blankets and fouling their cells. Despite their
 protests and the publicity generated by the protesting prisoners,
 the British government has declined to reinstitute special category
 status. During the "dirty protest", authorities routinely rotated
 prisoners to clean cells to reduce the risk of unhygienic
 conditions, which, as they pointed out, were created solely by the
 actions of the prisoners themselves.
 In August 1978, four Republican prisoners, all convicted of
 scheduled "terrorist-type" offenses as defined in the Northern
 Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1978, made application to the
 European Commission on Human Rights. The offenses of which they had
 been convicted included hijacking, robbery, possession of firearms
 with intent to endanger life and possession of explosives. The four
 prisoners alleged that, as a result of their participation in the
 prison protests, they were victims of violations of their human
 rights as defined by the European Convention on Human Rights. The
 claims were submitted under eight separate articles of the
 convention and included allegations of inhuman and degrading
 treatment, violations of their freedom of belief and conscience,
 violation of their freedom of expression, and discrimination on the
 grounds both of their political beliefs and of sex, in that their
 treatment was more severe than that of female protesting prisoners
 serving sentences in Armagh Prison.
 In June 1980, the commission declared most of the complaints to be
 manifestly ill-founded and therefore inadmissible. They found that
 the conditions in the Maze Prison were self-inflicted. They also
 stated that the government was not in breach of article 3 of the
 European Convention which states that "no one shall be subjected to
 torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment". The
 commission adjourned for further deliberation on complaints under
 article 8, relating to alleged restrictions on the right of respect
 for correspondence,.and complaints under Article 13, relating to the
 claim that there is no effective remedy under Northern Ireland law
 for consideration of complaints on prison treatment. The commission
 ruled that: "the applicants are seeking to achieve a status of
 political prisoner which they are not entitled to under national law
 or under the Convention. Furthermore, although this point has not
 been argued by the parties in their observations, the commission
 does not consider that such an entitlement in the present context
 can be derived from the existing norms of international law".
 However, the commission continued that: "in such a situation the
 State is not absolved from its obligation under the Convention
 because prisoners are engaged in what is regarded as an unlawful
 challenge to the authority of the prison administration. Such a
 requirement makes it necessary for the prison authorities to keep
 under constant review their reaction to recalcitrant prisoners
 engaged in a developing and protracted protest". Since the release
 of the commission's findings, the prison authorities have offered
 additional privileges to protesting prisoners, including
 compassionate leave in cases of death or serious illness in the
 family, and changes in visiting arrangements which eliminate
 searches of prisoners after visits.
 
 
 903
 in October 1980, seven protesting prisoners began a hunger strike to
 achieve political status. They were eventually joined by 23 other
 Maze inmates, three women at the Armagh jail and a few Loyalist
 prisoners. This hunger strike was opposed by all of Northern
 Ireland's political parties and was condemned by the Catholic and
 Protestant churches. Political parties in the Irish Republic also
 opposed it. There were, however, large public demonstrations in
 support of the hunger strikers in Belfast and Dublin, and sectarian
 tension increased throughout the province. The British government
 refused to negotiate political status, while publicly emphasizing
 that the prisoners could expect restoration of their privileges
 (already liberalized throughout the Northern Ireland prison system)
 if they abandoned the hunger strike and other protest action. In
 mid-December the hunger strikers abandoned their action without loss
 of life. However, there was a subsequent dispute about whether or
 not there were certain understandings that brought the strike to an
 end.
 In March 1981, Republican prisoners began another hunger strike in
 the Maze Prison. Before the strike was terminated early in October,
 ten men convicted of terrorist offenses, including murder, refused
 food and medical attention and starved themselves to death. The
 hunger strikers were seeking satisfaction of demands relating to
 five areas of the prison regimes association among prisoners, work
 requirements, prison clothing, visits, parcels and letters, and
 partial remission of sentences. The British government, while
 indicating a further willingness to liberalize prison rules, refused
 to accede to the hunger strikers' specific claims under duress or to
 grant all of the five demands. The government maintained that to do
 so would be tantamount to granting the prisoners political status
 and recognizing their command structure, thereby effectively giving
 control of the prison to the inmates.
 C. Disappearances
 The British authorities do not abduct, secretly arrest or hold
 persons in clandestine confinement.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The Criminal Law Act of 1967 (and the Criminal Justice Act of
 Northetn Ireland of 1977 which applies similar provisions to
 Northern Ireland) empowers a constable to arrest without warrant any
 person whom he, with reasonable cause, suspects has committed, is
 committing, or is about to commit what is, or what he reasonably
 suspects to be, an arrestable offense. Broadly speaking, an
 arrestable offense is defined as an offense for which the sentence
 is fixed by law (e.g. murder) or for which a person (not previously
 convicted) may under, or by virtue of, any enactment be sentenced to
 imprisonment for a term of 5 years. Procedures for bail, habeas
 corpus and suits for false imprisonment are routinely available in
 the United Kingdom.
 British common law allows for the abrogation of individual liberties
 by the executive in an emergency situation, subject to review by
 parliament. Continuing violence in Northern Ireland presented the
 government with a serious problem of protecting the rights and
 safety of the province's population as a whole. Acting on the
 premise that the fundamental "right to life" was in serious jeoparoy
 in Northern Ireland, the British government adopted two acts to deal
 with the threat: the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act of
 1973, now amended and consolidated as the Northern Ireland
 
 89-510 0 - 82 - 58
 
 
 904
 (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1978, which is applicable only to
 Northern Ireland; and the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary
 Provisions) Act of 1976, which is applicable to the entire United
 Kingdom. Although both these acts empower the restriction of
 personal liberties, they are subject to parliamentary review and to
 mandatory renewal at frequent intervals -- in the case of the 1978
 act at six monthly intervals and in the case of the 1976 act at
 annual intervals. Both acts were renewed upon the occasion of their
 most recent review, over the objections of a vocal minority.
 The practice of detention without trial under the 1973 act known as
 internment was discontinued in December 1975, although that
 provision of the act remained in force until July 24, 1980. In its
 September 1976 report, the European commission on Human Rights found
 that such detention had been justified as "strictly required by the
 exigencies of the situation" under article 15(i) of the European
 Convention on Human Rights. The European Court of Human Rights
 upheld this view in its January 1978 decision.
 Under the 1978 act the police are empowered to arrest without
 ..warrant any person suspected of being a terrorist, and to detain
 that person for up to 72 hours on their own authority. The act also
 ,gives the police the power to arrest without warrant a person
 suspected of committing, having committed or being about to commit,
 a-scheduled" offense. For the purpose of doing so the police may
 enter and search without a warrant any premises or other place where
 .that person -is, or where the police suspect him of being.
 The Prevention-of Terrorism Act of 1976 also gives the police the
 power to arrest without warrant persons whom they reasonably suspect
 to be involved with terrorism. Under this act such persons may be
 detained for up to 48 hours after their arrest. The secretary of
 state for Home Affairs and the secretary of state for Northern
 Ireland may extend the period of 48 hours by a further period not
 exceeding 5 days. This police power extends throughout the United
 Kingdom. Under the 1978 act, members of the armed forces on duty
 may arrest suspected terrorists without warrant and hold them for up
 to four hours, after which they must be transferred to police
 custody. The Department of State knows of no allegations that these
 limits have been exceeded by the police or the armed forces. The
 practice in Northern Ireland is to allow access to a solicitor only
 after 48 hours have passed since the arrest.
 The Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act of 1976 (enacted by both the
 Republic of Ireland and British governments) permits trial in any
 part of Ireland or Britain of those accused of terrorist offenses,
 regardless of where the alleged offense was committed.
 
 
 905
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair trial is guaranteed by law and observed in practice. All
 criminal proceedings are conducted in public, with the exception of
 cases involving public security (under the Official Secrets Act),
 cases heard in the juvenile courts, from which the public, but not
 the press, is excluded (Children and Young Persons Act of 1933 and
 the Children and Young Persons Act (Northern Ireland) of 1968); and
 cases in which, on the ground of public decency, the judge has
 discretion to close the court while evidence of a particularly
 intimate character is being given by a child or young person. In
 the trial of charges under the Official Secrets Act, the court is
 only closed (if at all) during the hearing of such parts of the
 trial as the judge, in his discretion, deems desirable; and the
 sentence must always be passed in public.
 In Northern Ireland 'scheduled offenses* (broadly speaking terrorist
 offences) are tried by a judge sitting alone. This form of criminal
 trial was introduced after the Diplock Committee, set up in 1972 to
 consider legal procedures to deal with terrorist activities in
 Northern Ireland, had made its recommendations. It recommended
 that, for scheduled offenses, trial by judge alone should take the
 place of trial by jury for the duration of the emergency. Among the
 arguments for this recommendation were that jurors were open to and
 afraid of intimidation, and that there was a continuing risk of
 perverse acquittals by partisan juries. The normal rules of
 evidence have been altered in such cases to allow for the
 admissibility of statements made by the accused while in custody;
 provided that such statements were not made as a result of torture
 or inhuman or degrading treatment. The absence of a jury has been
 the subject of criticism. The British government states it was
 introduced because of fear of intimidation of juries or acts of
 physical violence against jury members. Critics maintain the
 conviction rates in these courts are unusually high. The defendant
 convicted in such a court has a right of appeal to the court of
 criminal appeal on any ground, against conviction and/or sentence.
 At present, those concerned about the administration of justice in
 Northern Ireland are considering possible alternatives to the
 single-judge system, which might involve either a collegiate court
 or the use of lay assessors.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Searches and seizures are regulated by law, and judicial remedies
 are available for abuse of these regulations. In well-defined cases
 related to suspected terrorism, police officers or members of the
 armed forces on duty are permitted to enter homes withopt warrants
 in Northern Ireland.
 2.     Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Personal liberty and freedom of speech are accepted parts of the
 British way of life. These freedoms are well established by
 history, custom and tradition. The safeguards for this system lie
 in a representative parliament, in the power and will of individual
 citizens to make their wishes known through that parliament, and in
 an independent judiciary.
 Some radio and television stations are state-owned. Newspapers and
 periodicals represent widely differing views and do not hesitate to
 criticize the government.
 
 
 906
 law governing cases of incitement to racial hatred. A Commission
 for Racial Equality was established under the 1976 act to work
 toward the elimination of discrimination and to promote equality of
 opportunity and good relations between different racial groups. The
 Northern Ireland Constitution Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination
 on the basis of religious belief or political opinion.
 In the spring and summer of 1981, the United Kingdom experienced
 destructive rioting in many of its urban centers. Various
 inquiries, at the national and local levels, have been undertaken to
 examine the causes of these disturbances. One area of attention and
 controversy concerns policing methods in the inner cities and police
 relationships with young people and ethnic minorities.
 Because of the large number of immigrants from the Commonwealth
 countries, immigration policy is a subject actively discussed in the
 political arena. British immigration law is governed by successive
 immigration acts which explicitly preclude discrimination on the
 basis of race.
 In Northern Ireland, the Protestant-dominated provincial government
 structure, which existed from 1921 to 1972, engaged in
 discrimination against Catholics in politics, housing and
 employment. But during the period 1969-72, when violence was
 increasing, that government made great strides in passing
 legislation designed to end discrimination in all these areas.
 Further corrective legislation has been passed by the British
 parliament since direct rule was imposed in 1972. The main advances
 in legal protection since 1969 include: institution of universal
 suffrage, along with proportional representation in place of
 single-member districts for local council elections, and abolition
 of voting limitations based on wealth or property ownership;
 prohibition of religious or political discrimination by any level of
 government establishment of a commissioner for complaints to deal
 with grievances against local councils and public bodies and a
 parliamentary commissioner for administration; establishment of a
 central housing authority to meet the problem of sectarian
 discrimination in housing allocation and launching of new housing
 projects; prohibition of discrimination in employment, and
 establishment of a Fair Employment Agency to promote equality of
 opportunity; establishment of a standing Advisory Commission on
 Human Rights; and a special effort to recruit more Catholics into
 the civil service and the police.
 -In..response to the prevailing terrorist violence in Northern
 Ireland, the British parliament included in the Northern Ireland
 (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1978 a section prohibiting membership
 in or support of organizations (Protestant and Catholic) which are
 involved in terrorism. These organizations are specifically listed
 in the statute. This list does not include political parties, even
 those with close links to terrorist organizations. Persons
 prosecuted under this section are brought to trial in accordance
 with the trial procedures laid down by the 1978 act.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement, foreign travel and emigration.
 The Prevention of,.Terrorism Act of 1976 operates as an exception to
 these general principles in that it gives the secretary of state for
 Home Affairs and the secretary of state for Northern Ireland the
 power to make exclusion orders. In relation to exclusion orders it
 is important to remember that Great Britain comprises England,
 Scotland and Wales, and the United Kingdom is made up of Great
 
 
 907
 Britain and Northern Ireland. If the secretary of state is
 satisfied that any person is or has been concerned in the
 commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, or is
 attempting or may attempt to enter Great Britain with a view to
 being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of
 acts of terrorism, he may make an order against that person
 excluding him from Great Britain, if he is already there, or
 preventing him from entering if at the time he is outside Great
 Britain. The powers conferred on him by this act may be exercised
 by the secretary of state in whatever way he considers to be
 expedient to prevent acts of terrorism designed to influence public
 opinion or government policy with respect to affairs in Northern
 Ireland. An order may not be made excluding a citizen of the United
 Kingdom from Great Britain if at the time he is ordinarily resident
 in Great Britain and has been ordinarily resident in Great Britain
 throughout the last 20 years, or if he was born in Great Britain and
 has been ordinarily resident in Great Britain throughout his life,
 or if he is a United Kingdom citizen already excluded from Northern
 Ireland. In effect this means that a person, originally from
 Northern Ireland and therefore a United Kingdom citizen, may have
 lived in Great Britain for anything up to 20 years but still may be
 excluded from Great Britain and forced to return to Northern
 Ireland. Corresponding provisions exist for excluding persons from
 Northern Ireland. In addition the power exists to exclude from the
 United Kingdom a person who may be ordinarily resident in the United
 Kingdom but who is not a United Kingdom citizen. A United Kingdom
 citizen, therefore, may be excluded from Northern Ireland or from
 Great Britain (depending on where he was born and how long he has
 lived there) but not from the entire United Kingdom. This exclusion
 order power has been referred to by many, including the National
 Council for Civil Liberties, as a system of internal exile. Once
 excluded from a region of the United Kingdom, the person subject to
 the exclusion order is forbidden to re-enter that area.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 This freedom is well-developed. With limited exceptions, such as
 peers and lunatics, the franchise is given to all persons 18 years
 of age or over for parliamentary and local elections. Participation
 in the political process--discussion, debate, puolication of
 dissenting views--is open to all persons and political parties.
 Revision and improvement of the electoral system constitute a
 subject of continuing formal and informal debate. Recently, the
 electoral laws were revised to disqualify from nomination or
 election to the House of Commons anyone convicted and serving a
 sentence of more than one year in prison.
 Women are represented at all levels of British political life.
 Efforts are made by political parties to increase the proportion of
 women participating in the political process.
 The British trade union movement is one of the most active and
 influential in the world. The right to strike is virtually
 unrestricted.
 3.    Government Attitude and Record Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human
 Rights
 
 
 908
 The British government has maintained a fully open attitude toward
 international inquiries into alleged violations of human rights.
 For example, representatives of the European Commission on Human
 Rights and the International Red Cross visited Northern Ireland's
 prisons in July 1981. Britain is the host country of several
 international non-governmental organizations in the human rights
 field, such as Amnesty International. There are numerous active
 national organizations in this field as well, located in London and
 throughout the United Kingdom. The British government is an
 advocate of measures to improve the human rights machinery of the
 United Nations.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 The United Kingdom has been a pioneer in the development of the
 welfare state, and the British national health scheme is very
 comprehensive. British governments have given high priority to
 education and housing, and to care for needy persons. However, it
 is acknowledged that more needs to be done to eliminate the economic
 and social disadvantages suffered by members of ethnic minorities.
 A recent Home Office report stated that despite the proscriptions of
 law, discrimination continues in the provision of goods and services.
 In recent years the Northern Ireland economy has suffered from lack
 of growth because of its dependence on declining industries. There
 have been strong allegations over the years of substantial variation
 between the economic status and privileges of the Protestant and
 Catholic communities in Northern Ireland. Despite British
 government efforts in recent years to ensure equal opportunities,
 the Protestant part of the Northern Ireland community continues to
 be more prosperous, to be on the average more highly skilled, and to
 control most of the economy. In spite of British efforts to attract
 investment, the unemployment rate in Northern Ireland is
 substantially higher than that of tne United Kingdom as a whole, and
 this burden falls disproportionately on the Catholic population.
 The reasons for this are complex and are not explained solely on the
 grounds of religious discrimination. The British government has
 made special efforts to subsidize the Northern Ireland economy
 through public sector spending.
 British law bars discrimination on the basis of sex, race, religion
 or ethnic origin. Equal status for women is provided in the Sex
 Discrimination Act of 1975 and the Sex Discrimination (Northern
 Ireland) Order of 1976. There is equal opportunity for women in the
 professional fields and, under the Equal Pay Act of 1970 (and
 corresponding legislation for Northern Ireland), women are entitled
 to equal pay with men when doing work that is the same or broadly
 similar. The Equal Opportunities Commission assists in the
 enforcement of these Acts. There is a separate commission for
 Northern Ireland.
 UK GNP per capita (in U.S. dollars, 1979) was 6,230. Life
 expectancy at birth in 1979 was 73 years. Infant mortality rate per
 1,000 live births in 1978 was 14. In 1976, 99 percent of the adult
 population was literate. The population growth rate (average
 annual, 1970-79) was 0.1. The fertility rate in 1979 was 1.8. The
 adjusted primary enrollment ratio (1978) is 106 (male 105; female
 106).
