 COLOMBIA
 Colombia is a constitutional, multiparty democracy, in which the Liberal and Con-
 servative parties have long dominated politics. The presidency was weakened
 throughout the year by continued controversy arising from substantial, credible pub-
 lic evidence that President Ernesto Samper personally sought and accepted an ille-
 gal $6 million contribution from the Ca i-based narcotics trafficking cartel during
 1994 electoral campaihn. This enduring controversy significantly diminished the
 President's moral authorty and political abilityto govern. The civil judiciary is
 largely independent of government influence, although the suborning or intimida-
 tion of judges, witnesses, and prosecutors by those indicted is common. The separate
 military judicial system has been long accountable only to the uniformed military
 leaders hip, but in August the Constitutional Court directed it to relinquish to the
 civilian judiciary the investigation and prosecution of allegations of human rights
 abuses committed by police and military personnel.
 The control of the central Government over the national territory has been in-
 creasingly challenged by longstanding and widespread internal armed conflict and
 rampant violence-both criminal and political. An estimated 10,000 to 15,000 full-
 time guerrillas, belonging to three distinct communist rebel armies operating in
 
 
 452
 more than 100 separate guerrilla fronts spread across the nation, represented a
 growing threat to government security forces. The Government has been forced into
 an essentially defensive posture and its forces rarely initiate military action. The
 guerrillas exercised a significant degree of influence in about 57 percent of the coun-
 try's 1,071 municipalities. Some guerrilla groups, especially in rural regions in the
 southern and eastern parts of the country, continued to collaborate with narcotic
 traffickers. Such criminal activities produced revenues estimated in the hundreds of
 millions of dollars annually for the guerrilla groups. A diverse collection of regional-
 based paramilitary forces assumed a dominant role in the internal conflict, greatly
 expanding their political and military influence into a number of geographic areas
 previously dominated by the guerrillas.
 The civilian-led Ministry of Defense is responsible for internal security and over-
 sees both the armed forces and the national police, although civilian management
 of the security forces is limited. The Department of Administrative Security (DAS),
 with broad intelligence gathering, law enforcement, and investigative authority, re-
 ports directly to the President. The armed forces and the police committed numer-
 ous serious violations of human rights, although significantly fewer than in 1996.
 dolombia has a mixed private and public sector economy. The Government contin-
 ued to privatize institutions, although at a slower rate than the peak in 1995. Crude
 petroleum replaced coffee as the nation's principal legitimate export in 1996. Narcot-
 ics traffickers continued to control large tracts of land and other assets and exerted
 undue influence throughout society and political life. The country suffers from a
 highly skewed distribution of income, wit a per capita gross domestic product of
 $2,225.
 The Government's human rights record continued to be poor, although there were
 some improvements in certain areas. Government forces continued to commit nu-
 merous serious abuses, including extrajudicial killings; however, they were respon-
 -sible for fewer such killings than in the previous year. During the first 9 months
 of the year, government forces committed 7.5 percent of all politically motivated
 extrajudiciil killings. There were targeted killings by elements of the Army, notably
 the 20th Intelligence Brigade. Security forces were responsible for several instances
 of forced disappearance, and police and soldiers continued to torture and beat some
 detainees. At times the security forces collaborated with paramilitary groups that
 committed abuses. Conditions in the overcrowded prisons are generally harsh; how-
 ever, some inmates use bribes or intimidation to obtain more favorable conditions.
 Arbitrary arrest and detention, as well as prolonged pretrial detention, are fun-
 damental problems. The judiciary is severely overburdened and has a case backlog
 estimated at greater than 1 million cases. Less than 3 percent of all crimes commit-
 ted nationwide are successfully prosecuted. The use of "faceless" prosecutors, judges,
 and witnesses, under cover of anonymity for security reasons, continued in cases in-
 volving kidnaping, extortion, narcotics trafficking, terrorism, and in several hundred
 high-prfile cases involving human rights violations.
 Although the number of human rights violations by government forces declined
 somewhat from the previous year, the executive branch and Congress continued to
 be unable to eliminate those abuses. At year's end, the military exercised jurisdic-
 tion over many cases of military personnel accused of abuses, a system that has es-
 tablished an almost unbroken record of impunity.
 Inefficiency, intimidation, and impunity in both the civilian and military courts
 remain at the core of the country's human rights problems. The Prosecutor Gen-
 eral's office, however, increased efforts to prosecute high-profile human rights cases
 involving serious violations such as killings, massacres, and kidnapings committed
 by government forces, paramilitary groups, and guerrillas. The Government per-
 mitted the continued existence of special "public order zones" in some locations, in
 which military commanders in areas of high conflict directed all government secu-
 rity efforts-including the imposition of curfews, check-points, and requirements for
 safe conduct passes.
 The Government and its backers in Congress increased pressure on the media to
 influence reporting. Although the Constitutional Court struck down portions of a
 1996 government-backed media law, which permitted censorship, it left intact other
 key aspects of the law. This action left the Government in a position to reward its
 political backers, punish its opponents, and fundamentally influence the electronic
 media. Journalists practiced self-censorship. Violence against women and children
 is a serious problem, as is child prostitution. Extensive societal discrimination
 against women, minorities, and the indigenous continued. Child labor is a wide-
 spread problem. Vigilante and paramilitary groups that engaged in "social cleans-
 in"-the killing of street children, prostitutes, homosexuals, and others deemed so-
 cially undesirable-continued to be a serious problem.

 The many paramilitary groups increasingly took the offensive against the guerril-
 las, often by perpetrating targeted killings, massacres, and forced displacements of
 the guerrillas perceived or alleged civilian support base. During the first 9 months
 of the year, members of paramilitary groups committed 69 percent of all politically
 motivated extrajudicial killings. The Government took no significant action to re-
 strain these powerful paramilitary groups. The public security forces' relations with
 paramilitary groups varied considerably, ranging from noncooperation, to turning a
 blind eye to paramilitary activities, to some instances of active collaboration. There
 was no credible evidence of any sustained military action to constrain the para-
 military groups. While the President announced on December i a series of measures
 to combat paramilitary forces, including a task force to hunt down their leaders,
 these measures had not been implemented by year's end.
 The Government's National Human Rights Ombudsman argued that the govern-
 ment-sponsored, rural self-defense groups known as "Convivir" directly involved citi-
 zens in the armed conflict, converting them into targets of guerrilla attack. It be-
 came increasingly clear that paramilitary groups and their leaders were largely be-
 yond the control of the State, which had initially promoted the development of such
 groups in response to rising guerrilla actions. Many paramilitary gups have far
 stronger ties to regional or local political and economic elites-including narcotics
 traffickers-than they do to the military. This development significantly heightened
 the risks to a society in which fragile national institutions were already reeling from
 rebel attacks, narcotics-related corruption, a judicial system crippled by impunity
 and inefficiency, a disgraced administration and a disconnected, self-absorbed politi-
 cal class.
 An active policy of depopulation, pursued by some paramilitary groups against
 communities suspected of guerrilla support, was the primary cause of the growing
 internal displacement problem. The breakdown of public order in many rural areas,
 sparked by the continuing conflicts among paramilitary, guerrilla, and narcotics
 trafficking organizations; economic interests; and the police and the armed forces,
 has prompted the internal displacement of more than 525,000 citizens during the
 years 1995 to 1997. It remained unclear, however, how many of these were tem-
 porary rather than permanent displacements.
 Guerrilla forces continued to be responsible for numerous killings; during the first
 9 months of the year, they committed 23.5 percent of all politically motivated
 extrajudicial killings. Guerrilla forces also were responsible for disappearances, as
 well as more than 50 percent (867) of all formally reported kidnapings. As the Octo-
 ber 26 gubernatorial and local elections approached, guerrillas targeted political jf-
 ficeholders, candidates, and election workers as "military objectives"--p art of their
 declared campaigns to destabilize the country and delegitimize the Government.
 They killed or kidnaped more than 200 candidates and elected officials during the
 year and forced more than 2,000 political candidates to withdraw from electoral
 campaigns. Despite the widespread violence generated by guerrilla forces, the Gov-
 ernment carried out elections in the vast majority of municipalities and citizens
 turned out in sizable numbers and voted overwhelmingly in favor of national peace
 talks in a nonbinding plebescite.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Sectton 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Political and extrajudicial killings
 continued to be a serious problem. More than 3,500 citizens died in such acts, com-
 mitted by both state and nonstate a gents. Members of the security forces continued
 to commit extrajudicial killings, albeit at a reduced rate. According to multiple,
 credible reports, the securityjforces were responsible for approximately 7.5 percent
 of political killings during the first 9 months of the year in which the perpetrators
 could be identified. This represented a continuation of the steady and substantial
 decline since 1993, when the military was deemed responsible for 54 percent of such
 killings. The total number of extrajudicial killings directly attributable to the secu-
 rity forces continued to decline, from 126 in 1996 to 80 in the first 9 months of 1997.
 The police reportediy committed some social cleansing killings. Government and
 military officials give credence to reports of isolated killings during the year con-
 ducted by members of at least one army unit, the 20th Intelligence Brigade.
 The Government's independent National Human Rights Ombudsman (Defensoria
 del Pueblo) received 253 complaints in 1996 against the army alleging murder,
 forced disappearances, and threats (compared with 219 in 1995). The same report
 cited 226 complaints against the police for murder, disappearances, and threats
 (compared with 169 in 1995). The Attorney General s office (Procaraduria) reported
 that of the 3,000 complaints against public officials received between June 1995 and
 
 
 October 1996, it opened administrative proceedings in 1,338 cases, including 28
 massacres and 202 homicides. Some of the other cases did not involve public officials
 and were passed on to other government investigative bodies. It is unclear how
 many of the cases have since resulted in convictions or have otherwise been closed.
 The Institute for Legal Medicine reported a 1997 homicide rate of 66 deaths per
 100,000 inhabitants. The police and the judiciary have insufficient resources to in-
 vestigate most killings adequately. In 1996 the Superior Council of the Judiciary re-
 ported that 74 percent of all crimes go unreported, and between 97 and 98 percent
 of all crimes go unpunished. The Government Commission on Public Spending simi-
 larly placed the impunity rate for all crimes at 99.5 percent.
 Two intelligence agents, an army private, and several civilians-all associated
 with the 20th Intelligence Brigade-were arrested in May and placed in preventive
 detention for their presumed involvement in the November 2, 1995, assassination
 of opposition Conservative Senator Alvaro Gomez Hurtado and his assistant. A re-
 gional court judge ruled in November that there was insufficient evidence to war-
 rant the continued detention without bail of two of the detainees, who nonetheless
 remain under active investigation. By year's end, civilian prosecutions against four
 of the others were complete, awaiting only the judge's ruling and sentencing. Four
 field-grade intelligence officers with ties to the brigade were passed over for pro-
 motion in November, effectively ending their careers. The authorities were inves-
 tigating one of them, the brigade commander, for the murder of several of the bri-
 gade's own informants. The Government also forcibly retired a former commander
 of the brigade.
 On Aprl 4, the Superior Military Tribunal ordered the arrest in Cartagena of five
 members of the Nationhal Police for the September 3, 1995, death of Italian tourist
 Giacomo Turra from beatings while in detention. The military trial of police Ser-
 geant Raymundo Lianos Vasquez and four subordinates on the charge of premedi-
 tated homicide be gan in October.
 Army Captain Rodrigo Canas Flores was arrested on May 19, along with a para-
 military leader, for the April 22, 1996, massacre of 15 persons in the town of
 Segovia, Antioquia department. The Supreme Court upheld in December the convic-
 tions of 6 former police officers for conspiracy and aggravated homicide in the 1991
 killings of 18 persons in Villas del Rosario, Santander del Norte department. The
 court, which sentenced the six former policemen to between 14 and 26 years in pris-
 on, determined that they were members of an illegal paramilitary group operating
 in that department.
 In November 1996, the Superior Council of the Judiciary transferred to the mili-
 tary justice system the case of General Farouk Yanine Diaz and three other senior
 military codefendants on trial for the 1987 massacre of 19 local merchants. This
 transfer directly contravened constitutional requirements that such trials be con-
 ducted exclusively by civilian courts. On June 18, then-Commanding General of the
 Army Manuel Jose Bonett (who had initially attempted to recuse himself from the
 case) personally cleared General Yanine Diaz and his military codefendants of homi-
 cide and kidnaping charges.,Meanwhile, a civilian regional court tried three civilian
 codefendants on the basis of the same evidence, convicted them on June 25, and
 sentenced them to 30 years in prison for their roles in the massacre of the 19 mer-
 chants. Several human rights groups submitted a complaint against Yanine Diaz to
 the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), which has it under re-
 view. General Yanine Diaz and four other retired army generals remain under in-
 vestigation by the Prosecutor General's office for their roles in the development of
 paramilitary death squads in the Middle Magdalena region.
 In October the Prosecuting Attorney's Human Rights Unit formally charged two
 army Sergeants, Hernando Medina Camacho and Gusto Gil Zuniga Labrador, and
 paramilitary leader Carlos Castano with the 1994 killing of the leader of Patriotic
 Union (UP) Senator Manuel Vargas Cepeda. The two sergeants remained in preven-
 tive detention, while Castano was tried in absentia. UP leader Senator Hernan
 Motta, Ce eda's successor, left the country with his family in October, following in-
 creasing  reats to their safety.
 In late June, the Government approved compensation for the relatives of members
 of the April 19th Movement (M-19) guerrilla group who died during an army oper-
 ation in the southeast area of Bogota on September 30, 1985. This decision followed
 a recommendation by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR).
 In May a regional judge in Medellin sentenced in absentia accused narcotics traf-
 ficker Fidel Castano, cofounder of the largest paramilitary coalition, to 30 years in
 prison for the January 1990 massacre of 43 peasants in Pueblo Viejo, Antiouia, and
 or the 1988 kidnaping and killing of Conservative Senator Alfaro Os pia. In Janu-
 ary Castano's codefendant and fellow paramilitary leader Jose Anibal Rodriguez
 Urquijo was sentenced to 40 years in prison for his role in the two crimes.
 
 
 There continued to be incidents of social cleansing-including attacks and
 killings-directed against individuals deemed socially undesirable, such as drug ad-
 dicts, prostitutes, transvestites, beggars, and street children. Most of these incidents
 were attributed to paramilitary gups and criminal gangs; elements of the police,
 however, were believed responsible for a number of such incidents, as well. Criminal
 or "antisocial" elements were sometimes similarly "cleansed" from communities
 under the sway of the guerrillas.
 Killings by paramilitary groups (also known as "self-defense groups ') increased
 significantly, many times with the complicity of individual soldiers or military units,
 or with the knowledge and tacit approval of senior military officials. The number
 of such killings attributed to paramilitary forces increased significantly (from 751
 in 1996 to 752 during the first 9 months of 1997). The Ombudsman, the Prosecutor
 General's office, and the Presidential Exploratory Peace Commission all agreed that
 some cases indicated that members of the armed forces actively collaborated with
 paramilitary groups. The September 9 report by the Exploratory Peace Commission
 declared that, given the nation's historically ambivalent policy towards such groups,
 "the State in its entirety bears an important degree of responsibility for the creation
 and expansion of the self-defense groups." The report also noted that there was a
 clear relationship between local political and economic elites in some regions of the
 country and the self-defense groups, both in the financing of such groups and in the
 direction of their activities.
 Credible allegations of cooperation with paramilitary groups, including instances
 of both silent support and direct collaboration by members of the armed forces, in
 particular the army, continued to generate controversy. Military commander Gen-
 eral Bonett categorically denied that such cooperation existed, but tacit arrange-
 ments between local military commanders and paramilitary groups did occur in
 some regions. Government authorities and academic analysts asserted that para-
 military groups freely operated in some areas that were under military control For
 example, army commander Major General Mario Hugo Galan denied to the press
 in October that the army had institutional or operational contact with paramilitary
 groups, but admitted that there had been "individual cases" of army personnel co-
 operating with members of such groups. General Yanine Diaz, former commander
 of the army's Second Division based in Bucaramanga, was accused of establishing
 and expanding paramilitary death squads in the Middle Magdalena region, as well
 as ordering dozens of disappearances, multiple large-scale massacres, and the kill-
 ing of judges and court personnel sent to investigate previous crimes. Army Colonel
 Carlos Alfonso Velasquez, then serving as Deputy Commander and Chief of Staff
 of the Army's 17th Brigade operating in the Cordoba and Uraba region, was forced
 to retire in January after he privately criticized the Brigade's refusal to confront the
 paramilitary forces headquartered there.
 The statutes of the Self-defense Groups of Cordoba and Uraba (ACCU), the na-
 tion's most powerful paramilitary group, explicitly condoned extrajudicial execu-
 tions, stating "we respect all persons who are outside the conflict, but we do not
 so consider guerrillas camouflaged as peasants engaged in espionage." This attitude
 encouraged the widespread and arbitrary use of extrajudicial killing by paramilitary
 forces. According to credible sources, during the first 9 months of the year, members
 of paramilitary groups committed 69 percent of all politically motivated extrajudicial
 killings.
 The largest illegal paramilitary groups (centered in Cordoba, Uraba, and the Mid-
 dle Magdalena regions, plus the eastern plains) announced on April 19 the estab-
 lishment of a national umbrella organization, the AUC (United Self-defense Groups
 of Colombia). The growing participation in the conflict by civilians has been prompt-
 ed in part by the      as' increasing strength and presence in a growing number
 of municipalities (173 in 1985 compared with 622 in 1995) and in part by the Gov-
 ernment's failure to ensure security throughout the country.
 Overall, paramilitary killings escalated not only in those areas that have long suf-
 fered the greatest concentration of violence, such as Meta, Uraba, Cordoba, and
 Cesar, but in other regions as well, including parts of Antioquia beyond Uraba, the
 Magdalena Medio region, and the departments of Sucre, Guaviare, Caqueta, and
 Putumayo. Such killings reflect the intensified competition between paramilitary
 and guerrilla organizations for control across a broad sweep of territory (see Section
 l"aramilitary groups extended their influence into the historically guerrilla-domi-
 nated coca-growing areas of Meta department with their July 15-20 takeover of the
 town of Mapiripan. They singled out at least seven townspeople and executed them,
 reportedly for supporting the guerrillas. Thousands of townspeople subsequently
 fled, claiming that the paramilitary forces had killed as many as two dozen others
 and had thrown their bodies into the Guaviare River. In a September interview in
 
 
 El Tiempo newspaper, paramilitary leader Carlos Castano admitted responsibility
 for the Mapiripan massacre. The army and the Attorney General opened separate,
 formal administrative investigations into the possible role of four Army officers, in-
 cluding the Commander of the 7th Brigade, Brigadier General Jaime Humberto
 Uscategui, and five civilian officials, including the mayor of Mapiripan, in the take-
 over. The Prosecutor General's office also opened a criminal investigation into the
 incident. A similar paramilitary incursion into Miraflores, Guaviare, on October 18-
 20, which left at least five persons dead, also prompted the Prosecutor General to
 open a criminal investigation into the role of the security forces in supporting the
 attacks.
 With few notable exceptions, known paramilitary leaders remained beyond the
 reach of the law. The regional court of Medellin sentenced Gerardo Antonio Palacio
 to 8  years in prison for forming an illegal paramilitary group. The authorities
 were also investigating Palacio and others for the group's role in the August 15,
 1995, massacre of 18 persons in Chigorodo, Antioquia. On April 26, the police recap-
 tured Luis Alfredo Rubio Rojas, former mayor of Puerto Boyaca and leader of a
 paramilitary group initially founded by Medellin cartel narcotics trafficker Gonzalo
 Rodriguez Gacha, after 7 years in hiding. Rubio had previously been sentenced to
 12 years in prison for his role in the 1986-87 Honduras and La Negra massacres;
 he is also under investigation in the murder of 19 local merchants, the murder of
 12 Fiscalia employees sent to investigate those killings, as well as for hiring British
 and Israeli mercenaries to train members of paramilitary groups to fight the Colom-
 bian Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC) and defend narcotics interests.
 For the first time since the December 1994 establishment of the government-spon-
 sored civilian rural defense cooperatives known as Convivir, a Convivir leader was
 found guilty of forming an illegally armed group. A Medellin judge on October 23
 sentenced Jose Alirio Arcila Vasquez, director of the "Los Sables" Convivir, and
 other Los Sables members to 7 years in prison for the April 1996 murder of three
 men in Ciudad Bolivar, Medellin. The case against former army Captain Ciro Al-
 fonso Vargas Lancheros for his possible role in the incident remained ongoing.
 Former guerrillas who have laid down their weapons following previous peace
 agreements with the Government were also the targets of attacks-from both para-
 military groups and their former comrades-in-arms. Of the 5,897 guerrillas formally
 demobilized during 1990-94 from at least 6 rebel armies, 258 had been killed by
 the end of 1996. An additional 82 "reinserted" guerrillas had been killed as of Au-
 u st 15, 70 percent of them in Antioquia and Sucre departments. At least 19 mem-
 em of the Socialist Renovation Current (CRS), which broke with the National Lib-
 eration Army (ELN) and demobilized in 1994, were killed during the year. The July
 murders of William Jaraba and Fredy Fuentes Paternidad, Cordoba regional leaders
 of the CRS, prompted a rare joint statement by the Ministers of Defense and Inte-
 rior. They criticized the attacks by illegal armed groups, noted that the CRS was
 a legally constituted political movement committed to the democratic legal order,
 and ordered the police and military to provide the CRS "with maximum collabora-
 tion and protection of its social and political activities."
 The leftist coalition party known as the UP continued to be the target of political
 killings. Unknown assailants shot and killed a policeman early on July 26 as he suc-
 cessfully prevented the detonation of a 110-pound bomb aimed at the UP's Bogota
 headquarters. The UP has lost more than 3,000 members in a campaign of targeted
 killings waged against its leadership-a campaign     initially  precipitated by
 Rodriguez Gacha and the Medellin Cartel after the UP was formed as part of a 1985
 peace accord that permitted several thousand guerrillas to turn in their weapons in
 exchange for participation in a legal political party. There have been 600 reported
 murders of UP party members in Meta department alone since the campaign began,
 including the head of the Meta Committee for Human Rights, Josue Giraldo, who
 was killed in October 1996.
 In 1996 the UP brought a complaint before the IACHR that charged the Govern-
 ment with "action or omission" in what the UP termed "political genocide" against
 the UP and the Communist Party. In its October submission to the IACHR, the Re-
 insertion Foundation human rights organization charged that 13 regional UP politi-
 cal leaders had been killed and 3 tortured during the first 9 months of the year.
 The Government and the UP continued without success in their efforts to reach an
 amicable solution under the auspices of the IACHR.
 The guerrillas of the FARC, the ELN, and the People's Liberation Army (EPL)
 continued to commit extrajudicial executions, often targeting noncombatants in a
 manner not unlike the paramilitary groups. Local elected officials or candidates for
 nublic office, teachers, civic leaders, business owners, and peasants opposed to their
 I or military activities were common targets. Police and military personnel
 
 
 were also targeted for killings, both in and out of combat, but to a lesser degree
 (see Section 1.g.).
 On April 21, a FARC guerrilla squad raided the town of Liborina, Antioquia, held
 a public "revolutionary trial" of a local municipal official and four peasants accused
 of collaborating with the military, and executed them. In September FARC guefril-
 las killed more than a dozen persons in the San Luis indigenous reserve. In Decem-
 ber FARC forces killed a Catholic priest (see Section 1.g.).
 b. Disappearance.-"Forced disappearance", while explicitly prohibited by the
 1991 Constitution, remained an act not explicitly outlawed under the Penal Code,
 although the law codifies kidnaping for extortion and "simple kidnaping" as crimes.
 An estimated 3,000 cases of forced disappearance have been formally reported to the
 authorities since 1977; very few have ever been resolved. The U.N. Working Group
 on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances reported that it received 133 complaints
 of forced disappearance in Colombia during the past 4 years.
 According to data collected jointly by the Intercongregational Commission for Jus-
 tice and Peace and the Center for Investigations and Popular Research (CINEP),
 136 persons disappeared during the first 9 months of 1997. The army was deemed
 responsible for 6 of the disappearances and 130 were attributed to paramilitary
 grups.
 On January 29, the Inter-American Human Rights Court found that the Govern-
 ment should pay $89,500 to the families of Isidro Caballero Delgado and Maria del
 Carmen Santiago, following an earlier Court ruling that the State was responsible
 for their forced disappearances.
 The Judicial Council of State determined in September that the Government
 should compensate the families of M-19 guerrilla Irma Franco Pineda and 11 civil-
 ian cafeteria workers, whose disappearance was attributed to the army's 20th Intel-
 ligence Brigade after the army retook Bogota's Palace of Justice following the M-
 19's November 6, 1985 siege. The Council ordered the Government to pay the equiv-
 alent of 2,000 grams of gold to Franco's family.
 There has been no progress since the December 1996 decision of the Superior Ju-
 dicial Council to transfer the criminal investigation of General Alvaro Velandia
 Hurtado, the former commander of the 20th Intelligence Brigade, who was accused
 of the 1987 forced disappearance, torture, and murder of M-19 member Nydia Erika
 Bautista, to the military judicial system. The Prosecutor General's human rights
 unit was forced to terminate its investigation after it lost jurisdiction over the case.
 Like many similar cases, this case remained in the military justice system at year's
 end, despite the August 5 Constitutional Court decision that all such human rights
 cases be conducted by the civilian courts.
 The U.N. Committee on Human Rights found that the Government was directly
 responsible for the 1990 disappearance and murder of Torres Crespo, Torres Arroyo,
 and Chaparo Torres, three indigenous leaders.
 On April 23, antikidnap czar Alberto Villamizar called for investigation into alle-
 gations of cooperation between the Government's elite antikidnap squads (GAULA)
 and illegal paramilitary groups following the April 22 rescue by paramilitary forces
 of an oil company employee kidnaped in Bolivar department by the ELN.
 Police Major Manuel de Jesus Lozada Plazas, the deputy GAULA commander in
 Bogota, was arrested on March 10 and charged with the May 19, 1995 kidnaping
 of three former EPL guerrillas in Cali, where he had previously served as head of
 the GAULA. In its first such decision following the August 5 Constitutional Court
 ruling regarding alleged human rights violations by security forces personnel, the
 Superior Judicial Council determined on August 14 that Lozada would be tried in
 a civilian court.
 On April 18 in Bucaramanga, presumed members of a paramilitary group kid-
 naped the sister and brother-in-law of Nicolas Rodriguez, the reputed deputy com-
 mander of the ELN. This kidnaping was part of a campaign begun in 1996 by para-
 military groups to give guerrillas "a taste of their own medicine." Military courts
 opened an investigation into military complicity, however, after army Sergeant
 Jesus Antonio Sanchez Morales testified that General Rafael Hernandez, Second Di-
 vision commander, ordered him to take part in the kidnaping. Sanchez was placed
 in preventive detention; the kidnap victims never reappeared.
 Guerrillas were deemed responsible for over 50 percent (involving 867 victims) of
 the 1,693 kidnaping cases formally reported to the National Police during 1997, ac-
 cording to the Pais Libre foundation. Arrests or prosecutions in any of these cases
 were rare. Foreigners accounted for approximately 5 percent of those kidnaped, and
 represented attractive targets for both the FARC and the ELN, which generally de-
 manded exorbitant ransom payments for their release.
 
 
 The body of Vassily Lojkin, a Russian cyclist endeavoring to circumnavigate the
 globe, was found on March 7 in Apartado; he had been kidnaped, then executed,
 by the FARC.
 From August to October, FARC and ELN guerrillas waged a massive kidnaping
 campaign against candidates for the October 26 departmental and local elections.
 Hundreds of persons were kidnaped, held for several days or weeks, lectured, and
 subsequently released, typically after promising to withdraw their candidacies.
 Some 2,000 candidates nationwide withdrew (see also Section 3). Two Catholic bish-
 9ps were kidnaped in October and November, one by the FARC and the other by
 the ELN (see Section 1.g.).
 There has been no confirmation for nearly 4 years that three American mission-
 aries kidnaped by FARC guerrillas in Panama on January 31, 1993, and imme-
 diately moved to Colombia, were still alive. The PARC and other guerrilla groups
 regularly kidnaped foreign citizens; some were released after months of captivity,
 while others remained in captivity at year's end. The tortured body of American ge-
 ologist Frank Thomas Pescatore, kidnaped on December 10, 1996, by FARC guerril-
 las, was found on February 23.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution explicitly prohibits torture, as well as cruel, inhuman, or degrad-
 ing treatment or punishment. Reports of incidents of police and military torture or
 mistreatment of detainees nevertheless continued. The Office of the Attorney Gen-
 eral for Human Rights reported investigating 462 cases of torture committed by the
 police, DAS, army, prison officials, and other agents of the State during the period
 from June 1995 to October 1996. There has been no appreciable subsequent de-
 crease in cases of torture committed by various government security agencies. These
 abuses often occurred in connection with illegal detentions in the context of counter-
 insurgency or counter-narcotics operations.
 Paramilitary and guerrilla groups were also responsible for many instances of tor-
 ture; the bodies of a great many persons detained an subsequently killed by these
 illegal groups showed signs of torture and disfigurement.
 Prison conditions are generally harsh, especially for those prisoners without sig-
 nificant outside support. Severe overcrowding, and dangerous sanitary and health
 conditions remained serious problems. In December a visiting IACHR mission de-
 clared that the living conditions in Bogota's La Picota prison constituted "cruel, in-
 human, and degrading treatment of the inmates." The nation's 168 prisons and jails
 held 43,221 inmates in December, 52 percent more than planned capacity. In a
 number of the nation's largest prisons, the overcrowding reached even higher levels.
 Medellin's Bellavista prison, the nation's largest, was built to house 1,700 inmates;
 in December, it housed some 5,050 inmates-triple its designed capacity. Bogota's
 La Modelo and the Palmira prison outside Cali were both at 250 percent of designed
 capacity.
 Forty-six percent of all prison inmates are pretrial detainees. The remaining 54
 percent are roughly split between those appealing their convictions and those who
 haveexhausted their appeals and are serving out their terms.
 Prison conditions prompted an unprecedented total of 50 uprisings and hostage-
 takings by inmates in the first 6 months of the year. Three guards and a prisoner
 were killed at Valledupar prison in April after common prisoners and detained ELN
 members took more than 15 hostages. Guards, who typically have no riot control
 equipment, training, or capability, also went on strike at several facilities. Instances
 of abuse by and corruption among prison staff, as well as ongoing criminal activities
 by inmates, were so serious that judicial authorities announced on April 1 the trans-
 fer of control of the maximum security wings of La Picota, La Modelo, Palmira, and
 Medellin's Itagui prisons from the civilian National Prisons Institute to the National
 Police.
 Political detainees and prisoners are typically housed with common prisoners.
 There are no separate facilities for pretrial detainees and convicted prisoners. Key
 narcotics traffickers and some guerrilla leaders, however, get special cells with
 many comforts, some of which-such as access to two-way radios, cellular tele-
 phones, and computers-allowed them to continue their illegal activities from inside
 jail.
 Local or regional military and jail commanders did not always prepare mandatory
 detention registers or follow notification procedures; as a result, precise accounting
 for every detainee was not always possible.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) continued to have routine
 access to most prisons and police and military detention centers.
 The ICRC began to obtain more frequent access, although still on an ad hoc basis,
 to prisoners privately held by paramilitary groups or guerrilla forces.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution includes several provi-
 sions designed to prevent illegal detention; however, there continued to be instances
 in which the authorities arrested or detained citizens arbitrarily.
 The law prohibits incommunicado detention. Anyone held in preventive detention
 must be brought before a judge within 36 hours to determine the legality of the de-
 tention. The judge must then act upon that petition within 36 hours of its applica-
 tion. Despite these legal protections, instances of arbitrary detention continued; the
 Human Rights Ombudsman reported 509 formal complaints of arbitrary or illegal
 detention in 1996, far more than the 374 cases reported in 1995. The CINEP and
 Justice and Peace, using different reporting criteria, received 51 reports of arbitrary
 detention during the first 9 months of 1997.
 An estimated 46 percent of the nation's prison inmates were being held in various
 forms of pretrial detention. At the time of the April Valledupar prison uprising, the
 facility's population approached five times its official capacity; 341 of the 578 in-
 mates were being held in pretrial detention.
 Conditional pretrial release is available under certain circumstances, for example,
 in connection with minor offenses or after unduly lengthy amounts of time in pre-
 ventive detention. It is not available in cases of serious crimes, such as homicide
 or terrorism.
 Forced exile is not formally practiced, although there were repeated instances of
 individuals pressured into self-exile for their personal safety. Such cases included
 persons from all walks of life, including politicians, human rights workers, slum-
 wellers, business executives, and rural farmers. The threats came from various
 quarters: Elements of the military, paramilitary groups, guerrilla groups, narcotics
 traffickers, and other criminal elements.
 In more than 150 cases, the Office of the Presidency actively assisted the inter-
 national relocation of threatened persons, including the provision of financial sup-
 port, when it was decided that the Government was unable to ensure their security
 anywhere within the country. Richard Velez, a television cameraman who was beat-
 en severely by several army troops while filming a 1996 peasant protest by coca-
 leaf pickers in Caqueta department, fled the country along with his family in Octo-
 ber. Velez had received a number of threats, culminating in an early October armed
 assault (see also Section 2.a.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The civilian judicial system, reorganized under the
 1991 Constitution, is largely independent of the executive and legislative branches,
 both in theory and in practice, although the subornirig or intimidation of judges,
 witnesses, and prosecutors by those indicted or involved is common.
 The judiciary includes the Constitutional Court Supreme Court of Justice, the
 Council of State, the Superior Judicial Council, tribunals, and courts. The Prosecu-
 tor General's office is an independent prosecutorial body.
 The judiciary has long been subject to threats and intimidation when dealing with
 cases involving members of the armed forces or of paramilitary, guerrilla, and nar-
 cotics organizations. Although the number of instances of violent attacks against
 prosecutors and judges declined with the abatement of drug-related terrorism in the
 late 1980's-and as extradition of citizens was halted in 1991-prosecutors, judges,
 and defense attorneys continued to be subjected to threats and acts of violence.
 Prosecutors reported, moreover, that potential witnesses in major cases often lacked
 faith in the-Government's ability to protect their anonymity and were thus unwill-
 ingto testify, ruining chances for successful prosecutions.
 Corruption and intimidation are believed responsible for the relatively light prison
 terms that Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, longtime leaders of the multi-
 billion dollar Cali-based narcotics trafficking cartel, received in January (10/2 and
 9 years, respectively). A court subsequently sentenced Miguel Rodriguez to 23 years
 in prison for other crimes. The Rodriguez Orejuelas are credibly believed to continue
 to oerate their business from Bogota's La Picota prison.
 The Constitutional Court struck several blows against impunity during the year.
 In August it directed the separate military judicial system, long accountable only
 to the uniformed military leadership, to relinquish to the civilian judiciary investiga-
 tion and prosecution of human rights violations and other alleged crimes not di-
 rectly related to acts of service. On September 23, the Constitutional Court declared
 null and void a statute of the Penal Code (dating from the 1930's) that prohibited
 punishment of politically motivated rebels for any criminal acts committed in com-
 bat, except those that constituted acts of savagery or barbarism.
 Prior to the August Constitutional Court decision, most cases involving high-level
 military personnel were transferred to the military courts, where convictions in
 human rights-related cases were the rare exception (see also Section L.a.). One sig-
 nificant exception to the military's routine exertion of exclusive jurisdiction was the
 June 12 decision by the Superior Judicial Council to deny the military's request and
 
 
 460
 
 remand to the civilian courts the criminal case against army Colonel Hernando
 Navas Rubio. Navas Rubio, one-time Deputy Commander of the 14th Brigade at
 Puerto Berrio, Antioquia, in the Magdalena Medio region, was charged in connection
 with the November 1, 1988, massacre at Segovia, Antioquia, which left 50 persons
 dead and 49 wounded. Most significantly, the military courts had already obtained
 jurisdiction for the trials of three of Navas Rubio's own subordinates, who had been
 charged earlier in connection with the same crimes.
 The Attorney General's office is part of the Public Ministry. It investigates mis-
 conduct by public officials and orders administrative sanctions as applicable. The
 Attorney General for Human Rights investigates some allegations of human rights
 abuses by members of the state security apparatus, drawing upon a nationwide net-
 work of hundreds of government human rights investigators covering the nation's
 1,071 municipalities.
 The Public Ministry's National Ombudsman for Human Rights is elected by the
 House of Representatives to a 4-year term and has the constitutional duty to ensure
 the promotion and exercise of human rights. In addition to providing public defense
 attorneys in criminal cases, the Ombudsman's offices throughout the country pro-
 vide a legal channel for thousands of complaints and allegations of human rights
 violations. In practice, however, the Ombudsman's operations are severely under-
 funded and continued to labor under significant staffing shortages in an effort to
 develop a credible public defender system. The 1996 budget, for example, was suffi-
 cient to employ 558 public defenders (compared with the official goal of 2,000), pro-
 viding only minimal coverage for just 70 percent of the nation's municipalities. None
 of the public defenders were permanent members of the civil service; all were con-
 tract employees.
 The Prosecutor General is elected by the Supreme Court of Justice from a list of
 three candidates chosen by the President and is tasked with investigating criminal
 offenses and presenting evidence against the accused before the various judges and
 tribunals.
 The October strike by 41,000 judicial branch employees interrupted the prosecu-
 tion of hundreds of cases, and led to the release of some criminal detainees whose
 habeas corpus rights were violated because they were not brought before a judge
 for arraignment during the required period after their initial detention.
 The Constitution specifically provides for the right to due process. The outcome
 of all trials is determined by judges; there are no jury trials. The accused is pre-
 sumed innocent until proven guilty and has the right to representation by counsel,
 although representation for the indigenous and the indigent historically has been
 inadequate. As in past years, the judiciary remained overburdened and often in a
 state of chaos, staggering under a backlog estimated at over 1 million cases. The
 new Prosecutor General announced in May the establishment of a commission to
 analyze the backlog and make recommendations as to how to reduce the case load
 and streamline procedures.
 Trials conducted by the regular courts are public. Defendants have the right to
 be present and the right to timely consultation with an attorney. Defendants and
 their attorneys have the right to question or contradict (although not directly
 confront) witnesses against them, to present witnesses on their own behalf, and to
 have access to government evidence relevant to the case. Defendants also have the
 right to appeal a conviction to a higher court.
 The civilian justice system continued to incorporate regional orpublic order juris-
 dictions to prosecute cases involving the crimes of narcotics trafficking, terrorism,
 kidnaping, subversion, extortion, and some cases of human rights violations. In
 these courts, prosecutors, judges, witnesses, and attorneys act under cover of ano-
 nymity for security reasons. Given security concerns, and since testimony and evi-
 dence is typically provided to the judge in written form, regional court trials are not
 public. While a 1993 reform of the Criminal Procedures Code addressed certain pro-
 cedural shortcomings within the system, significant problems remained. It was still
 difficult for defense attorneys to impeach or cross-examine anonymous witnesses,
 and often the defense attorneys did not have unimpeded access to the State's evi-
 dence. As a result of such concerns, judges may no longer base a conviction solely
 on the testimony of an anonymous witness.
 Prosecutors, judges, and witnesses generally maintained that the protection of an-
 onymity provided by the faceless system is essential to the successful investigation
 and prosecution of cases in a country where violence is endemic and acts of revenge
 against those prosecuting violent crime may be expected. Domestic and inter-
 national human rights groups, President Samper, the Prosecutor General, and mili-
 tary forces Commanding General Bonett, however, all publicly stated during the
 year that the anonymous court system violates basic legal norms and procedural
 rights and requires stricter controls and limits. Some of the most vocal congressional
 
 
 461
 critics of the regional courts, however, have themselves been implicated in those
 courts' investigations into, the purchase of political protection by the Call narcotics
 cartel.
 The U.N. Committee on Human Rights and the IACHR urged the Government to
 abolish the regional judicial system and ensure that all trials adhere to due process
 norms. The Legal Statute of Justice sets a June 1999 deadline to disband the re-
 gional court system.
 In an attempt to deal with impunity, the Prosecutor General in October 1995 cre-
 ated - special Human Rights Unit as part of the regional courts system. The unit
 achieve  significant results; its group of 25 anonymous prosecutors addressed sev-
 eral hundred cases involving massacres, extrajudicial killings, kidnapings, and ter-
 rorism. They issued arrest warrants against members of the public security forces,
 paramilitary, guerrilla, and drug trafficking organizations and successfully arrested
 ozens of those suspects by year's end, including those charged with the May 19
 CINEP murders (see Sections L.a. and 4).
 Paramilitary groups and guerrillas continued to target and kill judicial and crimi-
 nal investigative employees for their efforts to enforce the rule of law. In August
 the Bogota regional court indicted in absentia 24 national and regional leaders of
 the FARC on charges of rebellion, terrorism, and kidnaping. Although top military
 leaders hailed the cases brought against guerrilla leaders, they strongly objected,
 and in some cases tried to obstruct, prosecution of cases against members of the
 armed forces and of paramilitary organizations.
 The Government states that it does not hold political prisoners. The ICRC re-
 ported that it monitored approximately 3,000 cases of imprisoned citizens accused
 of terrorism, rebellion, or aiding and abetting the insurgency, which are crimes pun-
 ishable under law. It is likely, however, that a number of those persons were con-
 victed by regional courts without the full due process benefits of a fair public trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 generally requires a judicial order for authorities to enter a private home, except
 in cases of hot pursuit. The Ministry of Defense continued training public security
 forces in legal search procedures that comply with constitutional and human rights.
 Defense Ministry officials complained, however, that in the absence of evidentiary
 proof collected directly by prosecutors, guerrilla suspects the security forces capture
 in or out of battle and turn over to judicial authorities are routinely freed due to
 a lack of juridically acceptable evidence.
 A judicial order or the approval of a prosecuting attorney is required to authorize
 the interception of mail or monitoring of either landline or cellular telephones. This
 protection extends to prisoners held in jails. However, various state authorities
 sometimes monitor telephones without obtaining prior authorization,
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law In Internal Con-
 flicts.-The internal armed conflict and narcotics trafficking are the central causes
 of violations of human rights and humanitarian law. Government security forces
 violated international humanitarian law, and paramilitary and guerrilla groups, in
 particular, committed numerous abuses. The ICRC reported that the Government,
 including military authorities, followed an open- door policy toward the ICRC and
 readily incorporated Red Cross curriculums on international humanitarian law in
 standard military training. A persistent emphasis by the army on body counts as
 a means of assessing field performance is a main contributing cause of government
 violations of international humanitarian law. With rare exceptions, according to
 military sources, local commanders typically preferred to transfer or discharge sol-
 diers accused of serious human rights violations, rather than initiate court martial
 proceedings.
 The U.N. Committee on Human Rights noted in May that, although the decree
 authorizing "public order zones" had expired in November 1996, the public security
 forces in some cases continued to exercise special powers over the civilian population
 and authorities, including judicial authorities. The Committee expressed particular
 concern for "the fact that the military exercise the functions of investigation, arrest,
 detention and interrogation."
 In zones where the guerrillas were active, such as the Sierra Nevada and Valle
 de Cauca, the public security forces often suspected the indigenous population of
 complicity with narcotics traffickers and guerrillas. In September and October, the
 military conducted a sustained joint air-land operation against the FARC, primarily
 in the Yari region of Meta, Guaviare, and Caqueta departments. On September 5,
 Escolastico Ducuara, the indigenous governor of the Pijao ethnic community, criti-
 cized the aerial bombardment of an indigenous community near San Vicente del
 Chagran, Caqueta department. Although General Gabriel Eduardo Contreras pub-
 licly rejected the reports as rumors, a subsequent field investigation by the National
 
 
 Human Rights Ombudsman confirmed that there had been indiscriminate bombings
 by the military in the indigenous communities of Pijao, Piratapuyo, and Tucano.
 Data compiled bY the System of Information on Households Displaced by Violence
 (SISDES) showed that in 1996 the public security forces were responsible for 16 per-
 cent of forced displacements.
 The Government initiated a program in December 1994 to organize and register
 civilian rural defense cooperatives, known collectively as Convivir, which were to
 provide counter- insurgency intelligence to local police and military commanders.
 The Government acknowledged approximately 440 such groups in 21 of the nation's
 32 departments by mid-year. Credible outside observers, however, placed the num-
 ber at more than 700. Although the authorities originally intended these groups to
 be unarmed, they subsequently authorized an undetermined number to carry small
 arms in self-defense. Other Convivir groups were clearly operating outside the terms
 of the law, as they were armed with rifles, shotguns, machine guns, and other weap-
 onry, much of it authorized, sold or otherwise provided to them by the military.
 Antioquia's governor testified biefore the U.N. Human Rights Commission in July
 in support of the Convivir groups as a legal manifestation of the civilian popu-
 lation's legitimate right to self-defense in the face of rising guerrilla violence. A
 number of observers and officials also argued that the Government's efforts to com-
 bat the guerrillas would inevitably be less discriminate, and result in greater
 human rights abuses, without the active participation of members of the public, es-
 pecially in providing intelligence information to the police and military.
 The Ombudsman a 1997 report to Congress, however, reiterated his office's opposi-
 tion to the Convivir program, on the grounds that it involved citizens in the armed
 conflict, stripped them of their protected status, and converted them into legitimate
 targeta of attack. Both President Samper and the official in charge of registering
 and overseeing the Convivir conceded in August that state oversight of the Convivir
 was both necessary and lacking. In a 4-to-5 ruling on November 7, the Constitu-
 tional Court determined that the Convivir were a constitutional means for combat-
 ing guerrillas, but that the Convivir must relinquish rifles, machine guns, and other
 restricted weaponry in their possession.
 The many paramilitary groups are diverse in their motivations, structure, leader-
 ship, and ideology, although the April establishment of the United Self-defense
 Groups of Colombia (AUC) as a national umbrella organization was clearly designed
 both to provide a national structure and to develop a more coherent political culture
 for the nation's local and regional paramilitary groups. The victims of paramilitary
 killings were typically unarmed, noncombatnt an  s. Paramilitary groups sought
 the death or displacement of civilians as punishment for perceived ties to the guer-
 rillas. The paramilitary rups centered their actions in selective killings, intimida-
 tion, and the forced displacement of persons not directly involved in the hostilities.
 They targeted teachers, labor leaders, community activists, mayors of towns and vil-
 lages, town council members, and, above all, peasants whom they accused of sup-
 porting the leftist guerrillas. A number of these victims included members of indige-
 nous communities, and paramilitary forces were responsible for the July massacre
 of 15 indigenous persons. Despitee  continuing, alarming rise in paramilitary ac-
 tivity since 1992, the military has failed to give priority to confronting these illegal
 groups.
 According to the independent Advisory Committee for Human Rights and Dis-
 lacements, some 257,000 persons were forcibly displaced from their homes by vio-
 lence during 1997; the total number of internally displaced citizens during 1995-
 97 exceeds 525,000. It remains unclear, however, how many displacements become
 permanent. Some people return home within a few days or weeks, while an undeter-
 mined number are permanently displaced and forced to resettle in other regions of
 the country. Forced displacement of civilian populations has become an integral part
 of the strategy employed by some paramilitary forces. They employed terror cam-
 paigns in some cases to depopulate communities believed to be loyal t leftist guer-
 rillas; in other cases, the paramilitary groups loyal to large economic interests (often
 including narcotics traffickers) displaced populations so that valuable land and eco-
 nomic assets could then be purchased very cheaply.
 Data compiled by the SISDES showed that in 1996 paramilitary organizations
 were responsible for 32 percent of forced displacements. According to the Colombian
 Red Cross, some 75 percent of the urban population of Riosucio, Choco department,
 and various nearby hamlets-some 15,000 persons in all-were forcibly displaced
 during March and April. The Uraba region of Antioquia and Choco departments suf-
 fered the greatest displacements on a per capita basis. According to the Advisory
 Committee for Human Rights and Displacement, mass displacements occurred in
 208 municipalities in 27 departments, with residents of Antioquia constituting 31
 percent of all displaced persons. More than 120,000 citizens were internally dis-
 
 
 placed during the first 7 months of 1997. On July 2, the Archbishop of Santa Fe
 de Antioquia criticized the paramilitary order not to sell foodstuffs to the residents
 of Frontino, Dabeiba, and Canas Gordas, declaring that 12,000 persons were being
 put at risk of having to relocate in order to obtain food-the clear intent of the para-
 military edict.
 Paramilitary groups and guerrilla organizations continued to pursue strategies
 that routinely violated citizens' rights. Their tactics consistently included
 extrajudicial killings, kidnaping, torture, targeting of civilian papulations and instal-
 lations, and the forced recruitment of children under the age f 15. Once recruited,
 child guerrillas are virtual prisoners of their commanders and subject to various
 forms of abuse. Sexual abuse of young girls is a particular problem. Guerrillas also
 were responsible for the continuing indiscriminate deployment of landmines, often
 resulting in the killing or maiming of civilian noncombatants.
 SISDES data showed that in 1996 guerrilla organizations were responsible for 26
 percent of forced displacement of civilians. Three main communist guerrilla ar-
 mies-the FARC, the ELN, and EPL--commanded an estimated total of 10,000 to
 15,000 full-time guerrillas operating in more than 100 fronts in an estimated 30 of
 the nation's 32 departments. Tied loosely into the Simon Bolivar Coordinating
 Group, these groups exercised a degree of influence in 57 percent of the nation's
 1,071 municipalities.
 On September 3, FARC forces attacked the Guatape hydroelectric facility, one of
 the nation's largest power plants. The attackers included a large number of child
 guerrillas; according to plant employees and other witnesses, some were as young
 as 8 years of age. As part of their attempts to disrupt the October 26 elections, ELN
 guerrillas attempted to use a 9-year-old child to deliver a 33-pound bomb to a poll-
 ing place in Cucuta on election day (see also Section 3).
 A FARC car bomb placed in front of the El Pescador Hotel in Apartado, Antioquia,
 on February 27 killed 11 persons and wounded 53. Two ELN car bombs on March
 16 in Cucuta killed an 18-month-old child and injured four other persons. Another
 ELN car bomb the same day in Saravena, Arauca, killed four persons and wounded
 five.
 A FARC letter bomb sent on April 14 to former EPL leader Mario Agudelo
 Vasquez in Antioquia killed his son when the youth opened the package. A second
 letter bomb, sent the next day to a former EPL member since elected to the
 Apartado city council, was defused by police. The bombings were part of the FARC's
 continuing revenge campaign against former guerrillas who had signed peace ac-
 cords with the Government.
 The Caqueta departmental ombudsman announced on September 12 that the
 FARC had killed nine members of the Koreguaje tribe from the San Jose del
 Cuerazo indigenous reserve, including Alejandro Piranga, governor of the reserve.
 The southern bloc of the FARC had previously threatened 64 Koreguaje with death
 for their supposed support for the army. In August the FARC killed 13 Koreguaje
 leaders from the nearby San Luis and Aguas Negras reserves. Ombudsman Jose
 Fernando Castro, who noted that the remaining survivors of the San Luis reserve
 consisted only of 2 adult men, 19 women, and some 100 children, reiterated his ap-
 peal to the guerrillas that they respect the neutrality of the indigenous communities
 and not involve them in the armed conflict.
 Both paramilitary and guerrilla groups were responsible for multiple violations of
 the protected status of religious and medical personnel, of the wounded, and of the
 emblem of the Red Cross. On several occasions during the year, paramilitary forces
 in Putumayo forcibly entered ambulances and hospitals in order to kill wounded
 persons receiving medical care. Several ambulances were fired upon, stolen, and
 subsequently used to transport armed paramilitary members or guerrillas. On Octo-
 ber 30, the police deactivated an ambulance filled with 220 pounds of explosives.
 The FARC, which had stolen the vehicle earlier in Colon, Putumayo, had rigged the
 explosives to detonate when the ignition key was turned. On October 25, Catholic
 priest Antonio Bedoya was killed in the doorway to his church in San Francisco,
 Antioquia, after ELN guerrillas opened fire on the departing helicopter of the de-
 partment's governor. That same day, FARC guerrillas in Meta department an-
 nounced the kidnaping of Hector Julio Lopez, the Catholic Bishop of Ariari.
 ELN guerrillas kidnaped the Bishop of Tibu, Norte de Santander (along with the
 mayor and mayor-elect) in November, releasing all three in December. On December
 9, the FARC killed Catholic priest Damuel Calderon in El Calvario, Meta.
 According to statistics compiled by CINEP and Justice and Peace, guerrillas were
 responsible for killing at least 256 civilians outside of combat during the first 9
 months of the year. In the continuing struggle for control of the narcotics and arms
 smuggling Uraba corridor, the guerrillas' retaliation for paramilitary successes in
 driving them from a longtime position of unrivaled dominance involved the regular
 
 
 victimization of innocent civilians, although some direct clashes with paramilitary
 units did occur. To justify summary executions of civilians, -guerrillas typically
 claimed that their victims either were military informants or that they simply re-
 fused to support the guerrillas' operations.
 The FAJe released 70 soldiers and marines on June 15 through the good offices
 of the ICRC and the Catholic Church-backed National Conciliation Commission. The
 60 soldiers had been held since August 31, 1996, when the guerrillas overran the
 military base at Las Delicias, Putumayo department. The 10 marines were ca tured
 on January 17 in Choco department. The release of the military personnel came
 about only after the President yielded to the guerrillas' demand to "demilitarize" for
 1 month an estimated 5,000 square miles of Putumayo and Caqueta departments
 dominated by the guerrillas and the production of coca.
 After months of being in the crossfire between the army, paramilitary forces, and
 FARC, ELN, and EPL guerrillas, the inhabitants of San Jose de Apartado, Uraba,
 and 22 outlying hamlets, with the support of the Catholic Church, declared them-
 selves on March 23 to be a neutral "peace community"-off-limits to all participants
 in the armed conflict. The threats from the army, paramilitary groups, andguerril-
 las came almost immediately; by March 31, 10 inhabitants had been killed. On July
 4, citizens identified several persons debarking from army helicopters as frequent
 watchstanders at the paramilitary roadblock on the edge of town, including the man
 responsible for the May 17 detention (and subsequent execution) of Francisco
 Tabarquino, a member of the peace community's organizing committee.
 On October 6, armed members of the FARC's 58th front confronted some 20 resi-
 dents of San Jose de Apartado and verbally abused them for refusing to provide the
 FARC with food, lodging, equipment, or intelligence. The guerrillas then ordered the
 group to depart, but detained Ramiro Correa, a member of the community council,
 as well as Luis Fernando Espinoza and Fernando Aguirre. The ICRC recovered the
 bodies of the three local leaders the next morning, bringing the total number killed
 in San Jose de Apartado to 41 since March 23.
 The FARC continued its campaign of killings against the legal Hope, Peace, and
 Freedom Movement, whose members had left the EPL following the 1991 peace ac-
 cord signed with the Government.
 Guerrillas killed more than 24 mayors or mayoral candidates during the year,
 compared with 14 in 1996, according to the Colombian Federation of Municipalities.
 More than 200 incumbents or candidates for public office, of all political orienta-
 tions, were killed in political violence during the year, as the FARC, ELN, and EPL
 guerrilla groups all publicly declared their armed opposition to electioneering in
 areas they controlled-or attempted to control. Guerrilas kidnaped at least 60 may-
 ors or mayoral candidates; many scores of candidates for lesser local offices were
 also abducted. The FARC, in particular, orchestrated a massive military and terror-
 ist campaign against political candidates and the electoral process. In addition to
 its traditional objective to undermine the State's presence and authority in con-
 tested areas, the FARC in some cases also sought to win control of a number of
 mayoralties (and municipal coffers) by eliminating competition to candidates who
 were actually members of the FARC's clandestine political party, the Bolivarian
 Movement for a New Colombia, which was formed in 1993.
 The guerrilla groups launched armed strikes, burned public transport vehicles,
 and targeted political candidates, incumbents, party headquarters, electoral work-
 ers, and institutions. On September 8, guerrillas bombed various party head-
 quarters in the cities of Bogota, Medellin, Cucuta, and Puerto Lleras. Guerrillas also
 attacked or bombed more than 25 offices of the National Electoral Council during
 August, September, and October, and targeted civilians who had been assigned to
 serve as officials at voting stations.
 Guerrilla threats forced more than 2,000 of the 42,500 candidates nationwide to
 withdraw, including all 4 candidates for the governorship of Putumayo. The Govern-
 ment refused to accept most of the resignations, however, saying that they came
 after the August 24 deadline for withdrawing candidacies. According to the Federa-
 tion of Municipalities, at least 75 municipalities were left without any candidates
 for mayor. At least 20 municipalities were left without candidates for town council;
 18 of these were also without mayoral candidates.
 On August 15, the ELN kidnaped the mayor of San Pablo, Bolivar department,
 along with three mayoral candidates and eight city council members. The same day
 in Simiti, Bolivar, the FARC and ELN jointly kidnaped eight of nine city council
 members, a mayoral candidate, a candidate for city council, and the town's treas-
 urer. The Simiti council members plus 23 candidates were freed on August 26 after
 being offered a choice: withdraw from politics or die. They withdrew.
 The mayor of Simiti, Ubaldo de Jesus Lopez, had fled the town in July, following
 the June 30 joint assault on the town by FARC and ELN guerrillas, which resulted
 
 
 in the deaths of three policemen and the abandonment of the town by the police
 and the army. Lopez, as well as the mayors of Tiquisito, Rio Viejo, and Morales,
 all relocated to Cartagena, following threats from paramilitary groups and from
 guerrillas. Paramilitary representatives threatened to depopulate the towns, which
 they considered guerrilla support bases. At least 10 mayoral candidates and 68
 council candidates withdrew in Bolivar, primarily in the southern part of the de-
 partment.
 Following similar FARC kidnapings and threats, candidates for mayor and coun-
 cils in 10 of Caqueta's 16 municipalities withdrew on August 29, and appealed for
 the national Government to postpone the elections until security could be ensured.
 A total of 298 council members in Cesar department withdrew their candidacies the
 same week.
 In a move opposed by military commander General Bonett, Antioquia's governor
 temporarily appointed four military officers as mayors on September 2, following the
 FAUC kidnaping of the elected mayors, who were released several days later. East-
 ern Antioquin was particularly affected. The Roman  Catholic Diocese of Sonson-Rio
 Negro announced in September that of the 21 municipalities in the diocese, guerrilla
 threats forced all the candidates to withdraw in 13 municipalities.
 ELN guerrillas killed Liberal Party Senator Jorge Cristo and his bodyguard in
 Cucuta, Note de Santander, on August 8. Following the paramilitary takeover of
 Mapiripan, Meta department, in July, all candidates for local elections withdrew
 their names.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of the
 press; although the Government generally respected this right in practice, there
 were significant exceptions. Journalists practiced self-censorship. However, the pri-
 vately owned print media published a wide spectrum of political viewpoints and
 often voiced harsh antigovernment opinions without administrative reprisals. The
 media continued to operate under a government ban against publication of the text
 of guerrilla communiques.
 The Samper administration was quick to apply pressure on the media when its
 core interests were threatened. Self-censorship was common, either to curry favor
 with the Government or to avoid political or economic retaliation. The Ministers of
 Communications and Mining were forced to resign on August 19, after a leaked tape
 recording revealed that they had conspired to reward 40 of 80 FM radio licenses to
 political supporters of the President. In October the Directorate of Prisons (a direct
 dependency of the Office of the Presidency) forcibly obstructed a television interview
 with a recently released prisoner, Santiago Medina, President Samper's former cam-
 paign treasurer, who accused Samper of having sought and accepted $6 million from
 the Cali drug cartel. (The interview was subsequently conducted from the open win-
 dow of an apartment building adjacent to Medina's apartment.)
 _ a 5-t4 decision on July 29, the Constitutional Court gave its approval to most
 of the December 1996 law that granted the Government and Congress unprece-
 dented powers over national television proamming. Although the Court struck
 down the most restrictive provision of the aw-which directed the Government's
 National Televisio n         (CNTV) to evaluate the license holders of television
 news programs on the three national (government-owned) channels and sanction
 those that did not meet the Government's vaguely defined standards of "objectiv-
 ity"-it upheld the rest of the law. Senator Martha Catalina Daniels, leader of
 Samper's supporters in Congress, publicly boasted that "the newscasts and other tel-
 evision contractors are not free. . . Thus the intervention of the State in this field
 ensures truthful and impartial news reporting."
 The 1996 television law includes a number of elements clearly designed to elimi-
 nate troubling news coverage of a scandal-ridden administration, to reward the ad-
 ministration's powerful backers for remaining loyal, and to influence news coverage
 during the 1997-98 electoral season. The law also terminated the contracts for 10
 private news programs before the end of 1997 and required them to bid again for
 e right to continue broadcasting. It opened the door to the creation of two new
 private television channels, which are expected to fall under the ownership of eco-
 nomic conglomerates that have historically paid for a privileged relationship with
 whatever government is in power.
 The dissenting judges noted that the abrwat termination of the existing contracts
 for news programs, which had been establised with the assumption of their even-
 tal extension for up to 12 years, would discourage private investment in television
 and punish those who had already made substantial investments on the basis of
 their renewable-now abrogated-contract. This sudden change of rules, they ar-
 
 
 466
 gued, violated the fundamental principle of good faith between the State and the
 citizenry.
 The new television law-originally launched by Samper supporters in Congress
 widely believed to be in the pay of the Cali Cartel-is regarded as political retalia-
 tion for media investigations into narcotics corruption in the Samper administra-
 tion, particularly President Samper's ties to the Cali Cartel. The co-owner of QAP
 News, Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez, called the television law fundamen-
 tally a smokescreen to destroy or expropriate QAP. In the wake of the FM radio
 licensing scandal, QAP News announced its intention to refuse to pursue its pro-
 posal to renew its television broadcast license, convinced that the Samper adminis-
 tration would never authorize it.
 On October 27, the CNTV fined QAP $80,000 (100 million pesos) for having with-
 drawn its application. That same day CNTV not only awarded 5 of the 10 news li-
 cnses-including the most lucrative slots--to families of former presidents, but also
 gave 3 of the licenses to close personal friends of President Samper.
 Other government efforts to influence the media included occasional calls on patri-
 otic grounds to limit negative reporting that might hurt the country's image in the
 world. The Government imposed some restrictions on electronic media coverage of
 incidents of public disorder and of drug-related or terrorist activity and reserved the
 right to prohibit coverage of certain news events that could affect state security.,
 All citizens have the right to seek a judicial injunction or motion ("tutela ") in
 cases involving violations of constitutional rights. This rovides all persons and or-
 ganizations, including the media, with a mechanism to denounce hoth governmental
 or private violations of fundamental rights.
 Both Colombian and international journalists typically work in an atmosphere of
 threats and intimidation. The body of Freddy Elles, a photographer for Bogota's El
 Espectador newspaper, was found on March 19 in Cartagena; he had been hand-
 cuffed, tortured, and stabbed to death. Gerardo Bedoya Borrem, editorial director
 of Cali's El Pais newspaper, was shot and killed on March 20. Bedoya, a former con-
 gressman and the cousin of General Harold Bedoya, then Acting Defense Minister,
 had criticized President Samper for accepting Cali drug cartel money and was a
 vocal critic of the corrosive influence of the drug trade on all facets of Colombian
 life. That same day, an anonymous caller threatened to kill Francisco Santos, an
 editor of Bogota's El Tiempo newspaper, and blow up the newspaper's office. Santos,
 who had been kidnaped and held for several months in 1990 by the Medellin drug
 cartel, attributed the threats to drug traffickers angry with the paper's coverage. A
 car bomb containing a pproximately 550 pounds of dynamite was deactivated on Sep-
 tember 3 in front of the offices of Medellin's El Mundo newspaper. The narcotics
 traffickers collectively known as "The Extraditables" claimed responsibility and
 threatened to conduct more such attacks if extradition-then under consideration by
 the Congress--were reinstated. Seven journalists were killed in separate attacks
 during the year.
 The Jaime Bateman Cayon movement, a small splinter group of the long-demobi-
 lized M-19 movement, claimed responsibility for the kidnaping on December 4 in
 Bogota of William Parra, the President's press spokseman, and Luis Eduardo
 Maldonado, a prominent radio journalist. The FARC kidnaped four other journalists
 on December 13, the same day that the Jaime Bateman Cayon group released Parra
 and Maldonado.
 The Government generally respected academic freedom, and there exists a wide
 spectrum of political activity throughout the country's universities. Paramilitary
 groups and _guerrillas, however, often targeted teachers at the elementary and sec-
 ondary levels in areas of conflict. The National Federation of Educators reported
 that 23 teachers had been killed and another 6 disappeared in the first half of 1997,
 primarily in Antioquia and Cordoba departments. University-level academics en-
 gaged in study of either the internal conflict or human rights were also similarly
 targeted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly, and the Government respects these rights in practice.
 The authorities do not normally interfere with public meetings and demonstrations
 and usually grant the required permission except when they determine that there
 is imminent danger to public order.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and the Government re-
 spects this right in practice. Any legal organization is free to associate with inter-
 national groups in its field. Membership in proscribed organizations, such as the
 FARC, ELN, and EPL, is a crime.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for complete religious freedom,
 and the Government respects this right in practice. There is little religious discrimi-
 nation. Roman Catholic religious instruction is no longer mandatory in state schools,
 
 
 and a 1994 Constitutional Court decision declared unconstitutional any official gov-
 ernment reference to religious characterizations of the country. The Government
 permits proselytizing among the indigenous population, provided that it is welcome
 and does not induce members of indigenous communities to adopt changes that en-
 danger their survival on traditional lands. The law on the freedom of cults provides
 a mechanism for religions to obtain the status of recognized legal entities.
 Both Jehovah's Witnesses and the Mennonite Church encountered problems be-
 cause of the pacifist nature of their churches. Jehovah's Witnesses complained of in-
 ability to perform alternative service to military conscription, despite the military's
 own legal procedures providingfor it. In April the Ministry of Education temporarily
 suspnded a December 1996 order to close the Mennonite biblical seminary and
 Justapaz, a church-sponsored human rights group. By year's end, however, Mennon-
 it seminarians still were being forced into military conscription.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides citizens with the right to travel domestically
 and abroad. Outsiders who wish t      t        ribes' reserves must be invited.
 In areas where counter- insurgency operations were tnderway, police or military of-
 ficials occasionally  ered civilians to obtain safe-conduct asses; guerrillas and
 paramilitary forces often used similar means to restrict travel in areas under their
 control. Guerrilla incursions, military counter-insurgency operations, forced con-
 scription by paramilitary and guerlla organizations, and land seizures instigated
 by wealthy individuals or narcotics traffickers often forced peasants to flee their
 homes and farms.
 Colombia has had a tradition of providing asylum since the 1920's. During the
 1970's, Colombia granted asylum to Argentine, Chilean, Uruguayan, and Para-
 fguayan citizens seeking refuge from dictatorial regimes in their own countries. The
 right to asylum, under terms established by law, is provided for in the 1991 Con-
 stitution.
 The Government cooperates with the Office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees and
 internally displaced persons. In June the Government formally invited the  theCR
 to establish an ongoing presence in the country. The Government reserves the right
 to deterne eligibility for asylum, based upon its own assessment of the nature of
 the persecution an applicant may have suffered. Some 58 individuals from 13 na-
 tions applied for refugee status during the first half of the year. The issue of the
 provision of first asylum did not arise. There were no reports of the forced expulsion
 of persons having a valid claim to refugee status to a country where they feared
 persecution.
 With the assistance of the Colombian Government, some 325 Colombians were
 forcibly returned in April from Panama, where they had fled to escape paramilitary
 and guerrilla activities in the neighboring Colombian departments of Choco and
 Antioquia.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens toChange Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change their government,
 and citizens exercise this right in regularly scheduled elections by secret ballot.
 However, critics question if elections have been fair, point out that vote buying has
 been a regular feature of elections in some regions, and that President Samper's
 1994 election campaign solicited and received contributions from drug traffickers.
 Presidential elections are held every 4 years, with the incumbent barred for life
 from reelection. The Liberal and Conservative parties have long monopolized the
 formal political process with one or the other customarily winning the presidency.
 Public employees are not permitted to participate in partisan campaigna. Officially,
 all political parties operate freely without government interference. Th~ose that fail
 to garner 50,000 votes in a general election le the right to present candidates and
 may not receive funds from the Government. Theymay reincorporate at any time,
 however, by presenting 50,000 signatures to the National Electoral Board. Voting
 is voluntary and universal for citizens aged 18 and older, except for active-duty
 members of the police and armed forces.
 Two of the Senate's 102 seats are reserved for representatives ofthe nation's in-
 digenous communities, while the 100 other senators are elected on the basis or na-
 tional "at large" balloting. Two seats in the 165-member House or Representatives
 are reserved or each department and the capital district; additional representation
 is apportioned through th  e of a complex population-based formula.
 On October 26, citizens voted for departmental governors and deputies, municipal
 mayors, and members of town councils and local administrative boards. Due to secu-
 rity constraints, however, elections could not be held in at least 33 of the nation's
 
 
 468
 1,071 municipalities, including the rural Sumapaz zone of the capital district, Santa
 Fe de Bogota. Electoral results were distorted in at least 15 percent of the nation's
 municipalities as the guerrillas' campaign of threats kidnapings, and murders
 forced the withdrawal of some 2,000 candidates for public office (see Section 1.g.).
 The campaign period was marred by a high level of paramilitary violence, and an
 even higher level of gerrilla violence, designed to intimidate both voters and can-
 didates, despite the Government's efforts to provide electoral security. Vote-buying
 and ballot-box stuffing, common features of erections in some regions, continued. On
 October 1, National Elections Registrar Orlando Abello publicly criticized the fact
 that vote "manipulation," in and of itself, was not punishable as a crime. The AUC
 paramilitary movement declared a ban on electioneering by those candidates it de-
 termined were in league with the guerrillas, but urged the citizenry to vote. The
 AUC said that it interpreted abstention as a vote for the guerrillas and threatened
 reprisals.
 The demobilized guerrillas of the Revolutionary Workers Party were unable to file
 a formal list of candidates in Sucre department, as seven of the party's candidates
 had been killed. Despite a revenge campaign waged by the FARC against their
 former revolutionary allies, demobilized EPL guerrillas won the mayoralties of
 Apartado, Carepa, and Turbo-the three key municipalities of Uraba's banana-grow-
 ing region, an area considered forcibly "cleaned" of the FARC's long-time presence
 by a sustained offensive by paramilitary forces.
 The Government invited the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Eu-
 ropean Union to send international observers to monitor the elections. ELN guerril-
 las, however, kidnaped two of the OAS observers and a Colombian colleague on Oc-
 tober 23 in Antioquia, only releasing them on November 1. Despite the security limi-
 tations, the results were widely accepted by most citizens and international observ-
 ers. The electorate also voted overwhelmingly in favor of a "mandate for peace," a
 nonbinding plebescite calling for national peace talks and strict adherence to human
 rights norms in the nation's armed conflict. The relatively high voter participation
 (about 55 percent) was, given the violence and intimidation from both right and left,
 seen as a manifestation of the public's ability and willingness to exercise their politi-
 cal rights.
 There are no legal restrictions, and few practical ones, on the participation of
 women or minorities in the political process, although they are underrepresented in
 official and party positions. Seven female senators and 19 female representatives
 served among the 267 members of the 2 chambers of Congress, including the second
 vice president of the Senate. Women served in a number of key cabinet posts during
 the year, including Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Justice, Agriculture, Education, and
 Health. The President's advisers for human rights, for juridical affairs, for Bogota,
 for Antioquia department, and for public administration affairs were also women,
 as was the director of the National Prisons Institute.
 Indigenous people are underrepresented in government and politics; 2 of 102 Sen-
 ate seats are reserved for indigenous representatives. Blacks also are underrep-
 resented in government and politics. A 1993 law that set aside two House seats for
 citizens of African heritage was declared unconstitutional in September 1996 by the
 Constitutional Court, which nonetheless allowed the incumbents to complete their
 term in office.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vest igation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A large and varied nongovernmental human rights community is active, providing
 a wide range of views. Among the many groups are: the Catholic Bishops Con-
 ference, the Colombian Commission of Jurists; the Intercongregational Commission
 for Justice and Peace; the Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human Rights;
 the Center for Investigations and Popular Research; the Advisory Committee for
 Human Rights and Dosplacements; the Latin American Institute for Alternative
 Legal Services; the Committee in Solidarity with Political Prisoners; the Association
 of Families of Detained and Disappeared Persons; the Reinsercion Foundation (fo-
 cused on demobilized guerrillas); the Pals Libre Foundation (focused on the rights
 of kidnap victims); and the VIDA Foundation (focused on the rights of victims of
 guerrilla violence). International human rights organizations in the country include
 the Peace Brigades International and the U.N. High Commissioner for Human
 Rights.
 Nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) investigated and reported on human
 rights abuses committed by government forces, various paramilitary groups, and the
 guerrilla armies. Many NGO's expressed serious concern over the growing para-
 military and guerrilla violence-and the Government's increasingly apparent inabil-
 ity to stop either of them. In particular, a number of NGO, as wel1 as governmental,
 
 
 human rights officials were alarmed by the rapid growth of paramilitary groups,
 both in terms of their responsibility for a significant proportion of human rights vio-
 lations and their growing political and military power.
 The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights opened a field office
 in Bogota in April to operate through April 1998. The office is tasked with monitor-
 ing and analyzing the human rights situation throughout the country and with the
 provision, of assistance to the Government, civil society, and NGO's in the field of
 human rights protection. It submitted private reports to the Government and to the
 U.N and occasionally spoke out publicly on particularly egregious abuses committed
 bygovernment, paramilitary, or guerrilla forces.
 e human rights community came under intense pressure during the year. Al-
 though the Samper administration generally did not interfere directly with the work
 of human rights NGO's, many prominent human rights monitors worked under con-
 stant fear for their physical safety. Human rights groups were subjected to surveil-
 lance, harassing phone calls, graffiti campaigns, and threats by military, intel-
 ligence, police, paramilitary, and guerrilla forces. Senior military officials, including
 General Harold Bedoya, then-Commanding General of the military forces, some-
 times publicly voiced feelings of frustration and outright hostility toward the NGO
 community, or publicly accused particular groups or individuals of working on be-
 half of the guerrillas.
 At least 10 governmental and NGO human rights workers were killed during the
 year, over a dozen others were forced to relocate within the country, or flee abroad,
 following threats. Many others were forced to restrict their travel sharply, particu-
 larly in the countryside. The Bogota-based representative of the U.N. High Commis-
 sioner for Human Rights requested special protection for nongovernmental human
 rights workers and organizations.
 Two CINEP workers Mario Calderon and Elsa Alvarado along with Elsa's father
 Carlos Alvarado, were killed in their Bogota home during the predawn hours of May
 19. Five armed individuals, dressed in uniforms of the Fiscalia's Criminal Investiga-
 tive Team, stormed their apartment and shot them. Elsa's mother, who was seri-
 ously wounded, survived the attack, as did the couple's 18-month-old child. No
 group claimed responsibility for the killings. Army commander General Bonett
 strenuously denied public suggestions that the army might have been involved. The
 Prosecutor General's Human Rights Unit arrested five Medellin-based hired killers
 and charged them with the crimes. The authorities dropped charges against one of
 the detainees in October and held the other four for trial. The investigation into who
 ordered the killings continued.
 There was no progress in investigating the October 1996 murder of the head of
 the Meta Committee for Human Rights, Josue Giraldo, who was then under the
 rotection" of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. The Court asked the
 overnment in February to prosecute anyone targeting human rights advocates for
 murder and emphasized the special importance of effectively investigating Giraldo's
 murder as a means of protection for others so targeted.
 Paramilitary groups stormed or otherwise attacked the offices of some human
 rights groups. Two p resumed paramilitary members killed Victor Julio Garzon,
 founder of the Meta Department Civic Committee for Human Rights, and an active
 defender of Meta coca-growing peasants, on March 7 in the Bogota offices of the
 Federation of Agricultural Workers. A small bomb exploded on June 4 at the
 Medellin office of the Colombian Red Cross when the ICRC was in the final stages
 of coordinating the June 15 release of 70 government troops held by the FARC. The
 Medellin offices of the ASFADDES were the target of a June 24 dynamite attack.
 Following increasing threats, Yanette Bautista, judicial coordinator of ASFADDES,
 fled the country with her family on September 9. Bautista is the sister of missing
 M-19 guerrilla Nydia Erika Bautista; the prosecution of those responsible for her
 1987 disappearance, torture, and murder has been stymied by the military courts
 (see Section 1.b.). At least one human rights group was forced to close its Bogota
 office after receiving direct threats from presumed paramilitary groups.
 The Government made a strong formal response to the September Amnesty Inter-
 national report on the crisis caused by the forced internal displacement of civilian
 populations. The Government claimed the Al report "lacked complete and current
 information", lamented the presentation of what it termed "inexact information," in-
 vited Al to visit, and recounted steps it said had been taken to deal with the situa-
 tion, including a national fund for populations at risk and a national information
 network.
 The Government has an extensive human rights apparatus, which includes the
 office of the President's Adviser for Human Rights, the National Human Rights Om-
 budsman and its regional representatives, the Attorney General's office for human
 rights and its regional representatives, and a human rights unit within the Prosecu-
 
 
 tor General's office. Nevertheless, the corps of government human rights advisers
 and monitors was often unsuccessful in getting its recommendations adopted on gov-
 ernment policy issues.
 According to September congressional testimony by the Minister of Defense, dur-
 ing the first 8 months of the year, the Attorney General's Office of Human Rights
 fied only one human rights case against a member of the military services, down
 from 34 cases in all of 1996, and the 1993 peak of 138 cases. Of the 15 cases closed
 by the military justice system or the Attorney General's office between January and
 August, 8 of the accused were absolved, 4 received temporary suspensions, 2 were
 fined, and 1 case was closed due to the death of the accused. None were perma-
 nently separated from service, compared with 12 in 1996. The director of the Attor-
 ney General's human rights office reported in mid-November that the office had re-
 ceived only 463 formal human rights complaints against members of the military
 forces, compared with 2,000 such complaints in 1996. The Attorney General has ju-
 risdiction to carry out disciplinary investigations and administratively punish mili-
 tary officials who improperly conduct criminal proceedings; it is not known, how-
 ever, if this power has ever been successfully employed.
 As part of the Defense Ministry's efforts to protect the rights of citizens, the mili-
 tary services and police have established 225 human rights offices throughout the
 nation since 1994. These offices accept and investigate public complaints of abuse
 and coordinate human rights training programs for public security personnel.
 An IACHR delegation visited in February to study the status of friendly settle-
 ment proceedings in a number of other cases brought before the Commission. On
 September 9, President Samper announced that the Government had compensated
 the families of 89 victims of human rights violations, under the terms of the com-
 pensation law approved in 1996. The IACHR acknowledged such steps but called on
 the Government to "create effective mechanisms for ensuring compliance with all
 the recommendations of the Commission and other international human rights bod-
 ies, not only those which recommend financial compensation."
 Several international human rights organizations conducted official trips to Co-
 lombia in December. For the second time in 5 years, the IACHR commissioners car-
 ried out an intensive on-site analysis of the human rights situation. Both Amnesty
 International and Human Rights Watch/Americas also visited, conducting investiga-
 tions and meeting with government, military, and NGO representatives, as well as
 with other independent observers.
 The ICRC continued to expand operations, with an office in Bogota plus 11 offices
 in various conflict zones. The ICRC, working with the presidential human rights ad-
 viser and the public security forces, helped provide training programs in inter-
 national humanitarian law. These programs were directed not only at affected civil-
 ian populations but were also integrated into the military training curriculum.
 Many observers credited these programs with having done much to foster a climate
 of increased respect for human rights and international humanitarian law within
 the military forces in recent years.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution specifically prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion,
 disability, language, or social status. In practice, however, many of these provisions
 are not enforced. In May the U.N. Committee on Human Rights criticized the con-
 tinuing practice of social cleansing, directed against street children, homosexuals,
 prostitutes, and criminals, noting that the Government had "still not instituted ade-
 quate and effective measures to guarantee the full protection of the rights of these
 groups, above all the right to life.
 Women.-Rape and other acts of violence against women are pervasive in society,
 and like other crimes, are seldom prosecuted successfully. The quasi-governmental
 Institute for Family Welfare (ICBF) and the Presidential Adviser's Office for Youth,
 Women, and Family Affairs continued to report high levels of spouse and partner
 abuse throughout the country. The ICBF conducted pro ams and provided refuge
 and counseling for victims of spousal abuse, but the level and amount of these serv-
 ices were dwarfed by the magnitude of the problem.
 The Institute for Legal Medicine estimated that 239,400 persons are victims of
 sexual abuse annually, 88 percent of them women. The Institute also estimated that
 95 percent of all abuse cases are never reported to authorities.
 The 1996 Law on Family Violence criminalized violent acts committed within fam-
 ilies, including spousal rape. The law also provides legal recourse for victims of fam-
 ily violence, immediate protection from physical or psychological abuse, and judicial
 authority to remove the abuser from the household. It allows a judge to oblige an
 abuser to seek therapy or reeducation. For acts of spousal sexual violence, the law
 
 
 mandates sentences of 6 months to 2 years and denies probation or bail to offenders
 who disobey court restraining orders. A 1997 law also made additional, substantial
 modifications to the Penal Code and introduced sentences of between 4 and 40 years
 for crimes against sexual freedom or human dignity, including: rape, sex with a
 minor, sexual abuse, induction into prostitution, and child pornography. The law
 also repealed an old law that fully exonerated a rapist if he subsequently offered
 to marry the victim and she accepted.
 The Constitution prohibits any form of discrimination against women and specifi-
 cally requires the authorities to ensure "adequate and effective participation by
 women at decisionmaking levels of public administration." Even prior to implemen-
 tation of the 1991 Constitution, the law had provided women with extensive civil
 rights. Despite these constitutional provisions, however, discrimination against
 women persists. According to figures published by the United Nations, women's
 earnings for formal sector, nonagricultural work correspond to approximately 85
 percent of men's earnings for comparable work, and women must demonstrate high-
 er qualifications than men when applying for jobs. Moreover, women constitute a
 disproportionately high percentage of the subsistence labor work force, especially in
 rural areas.
 ICBF data indicated that although working women suffered from a higher rate
 of unemployment than men, the economically active female population had a higher
 level of education than did men. Some 39percent of working women were employed
 in minimum wage jobs, however, compared with 31 percent of men.
 Despite an explicit constitutional prvision promising additional resources for sin-
 gle mothers andi government efforts to provide them with training in parenting
 skills, women's groups reported that the social and economic problems of single
 mothers remained great. The Constitutional Court ruled on September 25 that preg-
 nant women and mothers of new-born children under 3 months of age could not be
 fired from their jobs without '"just cause." Bearing children, the Court ruled, was
 not just cause.
 Children.-The Constitution formally provides for free public education, which is
 compulsory between the ages of 6 andl14, inclusive. Nevertheless, an estimated 25
 percent of children in this age group do not attend school, due to lax enforcement
 of truancy laws, inadequate classroom space, and economic pressures to provide in-
 come for the family.
 Despite significant constitutional and legislative commitments to the rotection of
 children's rights, these were implemented only to a minimal degree. The Constitu-
 tion imposes the obligation on family, society, and the State to assist and protect
 children, to foster their development, and to assure the full exercise of these rights.
 A special Children's Code sets forth many of these rights and establishes services
 and prors designed to enforce the protection of minors. Children's advocates re-
 ported the need to educate citizens wit regard to the code as well as the 1996 and
 1997 laws on Family Violence, which had been drafted particularly to increase legal
 protection for women and children.
 According to the Institute for Legal Medicine, 82 percent of sexual abuse victims
 were minors. An estimated 25,000 boys and girls under age 18 work in the sex
 trade. In 1996 legislators passed a law prohibiting sex with minors or the employ-
 ment of minors for prostitution, and in 1997 that law was amended to provide that
 conviction for nonviolent sexual abuse of a child under 14 carries a prison sentence
 of 4 to 10 years. Conviction for rape of anyone under the age of 12 carries a manda-
 tory sentence of 20 to 40 years in prison. Although enforcement of such laws is lax,
 crimes against children are being dealt with more severely than in the past. The
 ICBF oversees all government child protection and welfare programs and funds non-
 governmental and church programs for children. In conflict zones, children were
 also often caught in the crossfire between the public security forces, paramilitary
 groups, and guerrilla organizations.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution enumerates the fundamental social,
 economic, and cultural rights of the physically disabled, but serious practical im-
 pediments exist that prevent disabled persons' full participation in society. There is
 no legislation that specifically mandates access for people with disabilities. Accord-
 ing to the Constitutional Court, physically disabled individuals must have access to,
 or if they so request, receive assistance at, voting stations. The Court has also ruled
 that the social security fund for public employees cannot refuse to provide services
 for the disabled children of its members, regardless of the cost involved.
 Indigenous Pople.-There are ap proximately 82 distinct ethnic groups among the
 800,000 indigenous inhabitants. The Constitution gives special recognition to the
 fundamental rights of indigenous people. It provides for a special criminal and civil
 jurisdiction, based upon traditional community laws, within Indian territories. The
 Mis     of Interior, through the Office of Indigenous Affairs, is responsible for pro-
 
 
 tecting the territorial, cultural, and self-determination rights of Indians. Ministry
 representatives are located in all regions of the country with indigenous populations
 and work with other governmental human rights organizations, as well as with
 NGO human rights groups and civil rights organizations, to promote Indian inter-
 ests and investigate violations of indigenous rights. Nonetheless, members of indige-
 Snous grups suffer discrimination in the sense that they have traditionally been rel-
 egated to the margins of society. Few opptuities exist for those who might wish
 to participate more fully in modern life. In addition, indigenous communities suffer
 disproportionately from the internal armed conflict (see Section 1.g.).
 Traditional Indian authority boards o perate same 334 designated Indian reserves;
 the boards handle national or local funds and are subject to fiscal oversight by- the
 national Comptroller General. These boards administer their territories as munici-
 pal entities, with officials elected or otherwise chosen according to Indian tradition.
 Indigenous communities are free to educate their children in traditional dialects and
 in the observance of cultural and religious customs. Indigenous men are not subject
 to the national military draft.
 Most threats or attacks on members of indigenous communities stemmed from
 land ownership disputes concerning the designated Indian reserves. The National
 Land Reform Institute estimated that some 40 indigenous communities had no legal
 title to land they claimed as their own, and that an estimated 100 additional groups
 had title claims that were not recognized or reconciled.
 In October the National Public Order Tribunal overruled the October 1995 deci-
 sion of an Antioquia regional judge and found William Alberto Tulena Tulena guilty
 of ordering the May 27, 1994, killing of three Zenu Indian leaders and their driver,
 after theyhad filed a lawsuit regarding a land dispute in San Andres de Sotavento,
 Cordoba. The Tribunal found that Tulena had the men killed to prevent the valid
 pursuit of Zenu claims to the lands, which dated back more than two centuries in
 avor of the Zenus. The Tribunal ordered Tulena to serve 55 years in prison and
 ay 2,000 grams of gold to the family of each of his victims. Tulena owns extensive
 Pand holdings in Cordoba, was implicated in the activities of some local paramilitary
 forces, and is the nephew of a former president of the Senate.
 A contract that Ecoptrol, the national oil company, awarded to Occidental Petro-
 leum in 1995 continued to cause conflict with the 5,000-member U'wa indigenous
 community. After a Bogota superior court issued an injunction against further ex-
 ploration by Oidental and Ecopetrol on lands claimed by the U'wa, the Supreme
 Court and the Council of State issued separate, contradictory decrees in the matter.
 In May the U'wa fled a complaint before the LACHR. The community claimed that
 there was insufficient prior consultation, and that the prson cultural, economic,
 and environmental rights of the communitys members had not been respected. That
 same month, the Government requested that the OAS sponsor a joint investigation
 with a university of the dispute. Tat study subsequently recommended the imme-
 diate and unconditional suspension of oil exploration or exploitation activities; clari-
 fication of the status of U'wa territories and protected reserves; and the develop-
 ment of a formal process of consultation under auspices of the Government.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Approximately 2 million citizens of African
 heritage live primarily in the Pacific departments of Choco, Valle del Cauca, and
 Narino, and along the Caribbean coast. They represent roughly 5 percent of the
 total population, while the figures of the National Administrative Department of
 Statistics place the national black population at 16 percent of the total, or 6.4 mil-
 lion.
 Blacks are entitled to all constitutional rights and protections but have tradition-
 ally suffered from economic discrimination. Despite the passage of the African-Co-
 lombian Law in 1993, little concrete progress was made in expanding public services
 and private investment in the Choco or other predominantly black regions. Unem-
 ployment, for instance, among African-Colombians ran as high as 76 percent in
 some communities. Choco department remains the department with the lowest per
 capita level of social investment and is last in terms of education, health, and infra-
 structure. It also has been the scene of some of the nation's most unremitting politi-
 cal violence, as guerrillas and paramilitary forces struggled for control of the Uraba
 rlon.
 Bllegations of discrimination and hazing by the military against African-Colom-
 bians continued. The navy makes little effort to recruit African-Colombians, despite
 their traditional ties to the sea and maritime commerce. The U.N. Special
 Rapporteur on Racial Discrimination noted in a 1996 report that "The responses re-
 ceived were confused or an uncomfortable silence when one asked questions regard-
 ing the number or percentage of African-Colombians who serve in the army, the
 navy, the diplomatic corps, or in the Catholic Church hierarchy, as if these were
 unusual or inappropriate questions."
 
 
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1991 Constitution recognizes the rights of work-
 ers to organize unions and strike, except for members of the armed forces and po-
 lice, and those "essential public services" as defined by law. However, legislation
 that prohibits public employees from striking is still in effect, even if often over-
 looked. The Labor Code provides for automatic recognition of unions that obtain at
 least 25 signatures from potential members and comply with a simple registration
 process at the Labor Ministry. The law penalizes interference with freedom of asso-
 ciation. It allows unions to determine freely internal rules, elect officials, and man-
 age activities, and forbids the dissolution of trade unions by administrative fiat. Ac-
 cording to Labor Ministry estimates, approximately 7 percent of the work force is
 organized in about 4,9O labor organizations.
 Before staging a legal strike, unions must negotiate directly with management
 and, if no agreement results, accept mediation. By law, public employees must ac-
 cept binding arbitration if mediation fails; in practice, public service unions decide
 by membersnip vote whether or not to seek arbitration.
 In 1993 the internationa Labor Organization (ILO) criticized 10 provisions of the
 law, including: The supervision of the internal management and meetings of unions
 by government officials; the p resene of officials at assemblies convened to vote on
 a strike call; the legality of iring union organizers from jobs in their trades once
 6 months have passed following a strike or dispute; the requirement that contenders
 for trade union office must belong to the occupation their union represents; the pro-
 hibition of strikes in a wide range of public services that are not necessarily essen-
 tial; various restrictions on the right to strike; the power of the Minister of Labor
 and the President to intervene in disputes through compulsory arbitration when a
 strike is declared illegal; and the power to dismiss trade union officers involved in
 an unlawful strike.
 Labor leaders throughout the country continued to be the target of attacks by the
 military, police, paramilitary groups, guerrillas, narcotics traffickers, and their own
 union rivals. In June the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions an-
 nounced in Geneva that 98 union members had been killed because of their union
 activities in 1996, many of them employed in the banana industry of the Uraba re-
 gion. Members of paramilitary gups and the FARC guerrillas both carried out a
 number of massacres in Uraba during the year, often targeting the same groups of
 organized workers. Many of the victims of the FARC massacres were former EPL
 guerrillas, targeted for their participation in, or sympathy with, the National Syn-
 dicate of Agro-Industry Workers, a labor union closely associated with the Hope,
 Peace, and Freedom Movement made up of demobilized EPL guerrillas.
 A collective work convention signed in 1995 between Ecopetrol and the Union of
 Syndicated Labor (USO) remained in effect. That accord was the result of the Gov-
 ernment's restructuring, rather than privatizing, Ecopetrol to avoid massive layoffs.
 The USO leadership remained in open conflict with the Government on many is-
 sues. USO leaders reported further that its members in the oil-producing
 Magdalena Medio region continued to receive death threats from presumed para-
 military groups, who have accused USO officials of working with the ELN guerrillas
 waging a sabotage campaign against the nation's oil pipelines. In November the
 Prosecutor General charged 20 USO members-including the union's former presi-
 dent-with conspiracy to perpetrate dynamite attacks on the Cano Limon oil pipe-
 line.
 Unions are free to join international confederations without government restric-
 tions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution protects the
 right of workers to organize and engage in collective bargaining. Workers in larger
 firms and public services have been most successful in organizing, but these union-
 ized workers represent only a small portion of the economically active population.
 High unemployment (about 14 percent), traditional antiunion attitudes, and weak
 union organization and leadership limit workers' bargaining power in all sectors.
 The law forbids antiunion discrimination and the obstruction of free association.
 Government labor inspectors theoretically enforce these provisions, but because of
 the small number of inspectors and workers' fears of losing their jobs, the inspection
 apparatus is weak. The Labor Code calls for fines to be levied for restricting free-
 dom of association and prohibits the use of strike breakers.
 Collective pacts-agreements between individual workers and their employers-
 are not subject to collective bargaining and are typically used by employers to ob-
 struct labor organization. Although employers must register collective pacts with the
 Ministry of Labor, the Ministry does not exercise any oversight or control over them.
 The Labor Code also eliminates mandatory mediation in private labor-manage-
 ment disputes and extends the grace period before the Government can intervene
 
 
 in a conflict. Federations and confederations may assist affiliate unions in collective
 bargaining.
 Labor law applies to the country's seven free trade zones (FTZ's), but its stand-
 ards are difficult to enforce. Public employee unions have won collective bargaining
 agreements in the FTZ's of Barranquilla, Buenaventura, Cartagena, and Santa
 Marta, but the garment manufacturing enterprises in Medellin and Risaralda,
 which have the largest number of employees, are not organized. National labor lead-
 ers claim that in these FTZ's the provisions of the Labor Code dealing with wages,
 hours, health, and safety are not honored.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution forbids slavery
 and any form of forced or compulsory labor, and this prohibition is generally re-
 spected in practice. The law prohibits forced or bonded labor by children but the
 Government does not have the resources to effectively enforce this prohibition (see
 Section 6.d.)
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Gov-
 ernment prohibits forced and bonded labor by children but is unable to enforce this
 prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.).
 The Constitution bans the employment of children under the age of 14 in most
 jobs, and the Labor Code prohibits the granting of work permits to youths under
 the age of 18. A 1989 decree establishing the Minors Code prohibits the employment
 of children under age 12 and demands exceptional conditions and the express au-
 thorization of Labor Ministry inspectors for the employment of children between the
 ages of 12 and 17 (inclusive). These requirements are largely ignored in practice,
 however, and only 5 percent of those working have filed for the required work per-
 mits.
 A 1996 Labor Ministry study determined that 28 percent of all children between
 the ages of 12 and 17 worked. Some 15 percent of urban 12- to 17-year-olds worked,
 as did fully one-third of those in rural areas. More than 50 percent of all child work-
 ers did not attend school at all. The study also determined that child workers aver-
 aged 50 hours of work per week, double the legal limit of 26 hours per week. In
 rural areas, the study determined that 75 percent of child workers received, on aver-
 age, one-fourth of the minimum wage, while 25 percent received no pay at all. Only
 10 percent of child laborers were found to be covered by the health services of the
 social security system. A 1996 study by the National Human Rights Ombudsman
 of child labor in Putumayo department found that 22 percent of the children be-
 tween the ages of 5 and 18 were full-time coca-pickers. In the municipality of Orito,
 the figure reached 70 percent.
 Child workers are exposed to the same risks that affect adult workers, including
 exposure to toxic substances and accidental injuries, all of which contribute to im-
 paired physical development. The ICBF continued its outreach campaign to inform
 child laborers of their rights and where to turn for help. No statistics were available
 to measure the impact of this effort.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets a uniform minimum
 wage for workers every January to serve as a benchmark for wage bargaining. The
 monthly minimum wage was $139.25 (172,682 pesos) throughout 1997. The mini-
 mum wage does not provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family.
 Because the minimum wage is based on the Government's target inflation rate, the
 minimum wage has not kept up with inflation in recent years. By government esti-
 mates, the price of the family shopping basket is 2.4 times the minimum wage.
 However, 77 percent of all workers earn no more than, and often much less than,
 twice the minimum wage.
 The law provides for a standard workday of 8 hours and a 48-hour workweek, but
 it does not specifically require a weekly rest period of at least 24 hours, a failing
 criticized by the ILO. Legislation provides comprehensive protection for workers' oc-
 cupational safety-and health, but these standards are difficult to enforce, in part
 due to the small number of Labor Ministry inspectors. In addition, unorganized
 workers in the informal sector fear the loss of their jobs if they exercise their right
 to denounce abuses, particularly in the agricultural sector. According to the Labor
 Code, workers have the right to withdraw from a hazardous work situation without
 jeopardizing continued employment. In general, a lack of public safety awareness,
 inadequate attention by unions, and lax enforcement by the Labor Ministry result
 in an a very high level of industrial accidents and unhealthy working conditions.
 Over 80 percent of industries lack industrial security plans. The Social Security In-
 stitute reported 115,000 work-related accidents for 1995, 17,000 of which resulted
 in deaths. Informed observers reported that the level of work-related accidents was
 expected to remain at comparably high levels in 1997.
