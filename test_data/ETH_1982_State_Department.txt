 ETHIOPIA
 Prior to the 1974 revolution, Ethiopia was a feudal empire ruled
 by Emperor Haile Selassie with the aid of aristocratic land own-
 ers. Now an avowedly Marxist-Leninist state, it is ruled by a
 military government headed by Chairman Mengistu Haile-Mariam, who
 consolidated his power in 1977. There are no civil and political
 freedoms, nor is there legal protection against human rights
 abuses.
 The legitimacy of the Provisional Military Government of Social-
 ist Ethiopia is not accepted by certain elements among the
 country's constituent ethnic groups. There are insurgency
 movements of greater or lesser size among the Eritreans,
 Tigreans, Oromos (Gallas), Sidamos, and ethnic Somalis. The
 Government's 1976 promise of greater regional autonomy to
 ethnic groups has not been fulfilled. Its continued efforts to
 suppress the insurgents have given rise to persistent human
 rights violations. The insurgents, however, also engage in
 violence and commit violations. Ethiopia's ethnic insurgencies
 have historic roots. Sustained opposition and conflict began in
 Eritrea in 1960 when Emperor Haile Selassie manipulated the
 abolition of its autonomous status.
 Ethiopia remains one of the world's least developed countries.
 The Government has declared its commitment to improved living
 conditions and to the economic progress of the majority. It is
 currently expending considerable effort on a nation-wide program
 to promote literacy for which it was awarded an international
 prize by UNESCO in 1982. The Government also has under way a
 nationwide health education campaign. It has further sought to
 make secondary and university education available to broader
 numbers of people. Achievement of government goals, however, has
 been seriously hampered by both financial and ideological con-
 straints. Ethiopia's rural population (about 85 percent of the
 total) has benefited directly from the 1975 land reform and sub-
 sequent land development programs. The land collectivization
 decree of 1979 has been implemented only to a very small degree
 because of popular resistance. Basic foodstuffs have to be
 rationed despite Ethiopia's rich agricultural resources, and
 serious shortages persist in a number of regions of the country.
 The security of human rights in Ethiopia has never been firm.
 Under the-previous regime, there were few or no guarantees of the
 integrity of the person. Civil and political freedoms were se-
 verely limited. Ownership of land was concentrated in the hands
 of a select few and little was done by the Government to promote
 the economic or social well-being of the general population.
 After the 1974 revolution the level of human rights abuses in
 Ethiopia, high already under the previous regime, increased very
 sharply. The human rights situation was at its worst in 1977 and
 1978, when the military leadership and its civilian opponents
 fought for control of the Government. Perhaps 10,000 men, women,
 and children were killed, while tens of thousands of others were
 tortured, imprisoned, or fled into exile during the "Red Terror"
 campaign. With the consolidation of the Government's control
 over most of the country, the level of abuses of the integrity of
 the person is now significantly lower. Ethiopians are no longer
 subject to the kind of random violence and arbitrary arrest and
 execution which terrorized Ethiopian society several years ago.
 In 1982 large numbers of political prisoners were released.
 There are, however, no civil and political freedoms, nor is there
 substantial legal protection against human rights abuses. Hun-
 dreds of thousands of Ethiopians live abroad in exile, self-
 imposed or otherwise.
 
 
 At the beginning of 1982, the Government launched the latest in a
 series of military efforts in Eritrea. The prosecution of the
 campaign has resulted in major human rights abuses, reportedly
 committed by both government forces and the insurgents fighting
 against them. The Government has engaged in arrests, torture,
 and summary execution in Eritrea of those suspected of independ-
 ence sympathies. Those suspected of aiding ethnic insurgent
 groups in other areas also have been arrested. Several hundred
 Eritreans and Tigreans, including government officials and
 employees of international organizations, were arrested this year
 in Addis Ababa on suspicion of providing material aid and intelli-
 gence to insurgents in the north. The past year has also seen a
 continuation of actions against certain churches associated with
 foreign missionaries, although some foreign missionary establish-
 ments continue to operate without interference.
 Prospects for improvement in human rights conditions do not-seem
 favorable. Ideological indoctrination of the population in the
 tenets of Marxism-Leninism continues unabated. School curricula
 have recently been altered on ideological grounds. News and
 media continue under government direction. Strict control is
 exercised over participation in the political process. Govern-
 ment controlled mass organizations, notably peasant, trade union,
 youth, and women's associations, are being extended throughout the
 country. Workers' control committees are being set up to assure
 ideological conformity and stand watch against waste and fraud.
 No political opposition is allowed and no enforceable legal pro-
 tections have been introduced for the protection of the civil
 and political rights of individuals.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 The number of politically motivated murders or executions has
 declined substantially since the Red Terror period of 1977-78,
 during which opposition groups and the Government used terror and
 assassination against each other. It is difficult to make an
 accurate estimate of the number of such killings that took place
 in the past year. Such killings occurred mainly or perhaps
 exclusively in connection with ethnic insurgencies. Responsibil-
 ity rests both with the Government and insurgent groups for using
 killing as a tool to destroy opposition or to advance political
 goals through the creation of an atmosphere of terror. Areas
 primarily affected are Eritrea and Tigre, and to a lesser extent,
 Oromo-populated areas and the Ogaden. Government troops have
 carried out arbitrary arrests and summary executions of both
 those in active opposition and those suspected of supporting
 secessionist groups. Assassination of government officials by
 these groups is designed to undermine government control of
 areas in which the insurgents are active.
 b. Disappearance
 Ethiopians may be arrested and held without legal process or
 notice to their families. There is little official account-
 ability for the whereabouts or welfare of prisoners. Arrests
 are often secret and records not always maintained. Some
 prisoners deliberately are held in clandestine confinement,
 while others have disappeared for prolonged periods because the
 authorities failed to notify families as to their whereabouts.
 Since food for Ethiopian prisoners must be provided by families,
 most families manage to locate their relatives in prison fairly
 
 
 100
 quickly. There have, however, been cases of prolonged disappear-
 ances. It is believed that such victims have been executed.
 Families have no way of knowing even over years of time if a par-
 ticular inmate is alive, even if the prison continues to accept
 their food, because food brought by families for their relatives
 is often shared rather than given directly to individual prisoners.
 Many recent disappearances have been caused by both government
 and insurgent forces' conscription of young men. Young men who
 disappear from towns and villages often emerge as soldiers
 in the Ethiopian army or one of the ethnic liberation groups.
 Men in cities must provide proof of employment to their urban
 dwellers' associations (kebeles) or risk selection for conscrip-
 tion. Conscription is not yet a legally authorized process;
 rather, kebeles periodically round up men to be loaded onto
 military trucks bound for training camps.
 c. Torture
 Torture is not prohibited by law. Reports of the use of physi-
 cal torture against military and political prisoners, especially
 those accused of secessionist tendencies, during interrogation
 have been received in previous years. In its most recent report,
 Amnesty International reports that torture was said to be used
 in two Addis Ababa prisons during 1981. No specific allegations
 of torture were received in 1982, but it is possible that the
 practice continues. Repeated interrogation of those suspected
 of opposition to the Government has been frequent. Interroga-
 tions sometimes involve the purposeful infliction of mental
 suffering, such as threats to the individual or his family.
 Some members of "new religions" (i.e., Protestant sects) have in
 the past reported that regional security forces tortured members
 of the churches who were being detained.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Prisoners and detainees in Ethiopia are sometimes subjected
 to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, especially during
 the interrogation period. Conditions in many Ethiopian prisons
 are poor. In certain prisons, prisoners are kept in semi-
 darkness in vastly overcrowded and damp cells and corridors.
 Sanitary conditions are inadequate. Conditions in Ethiopia's
 main detention center, Carchelli prison, are good by contrast.
 At Carchelli occupational and academic training, usually with
 other prisoners as teachers, is available. Inmates are given
 considerable freedom in determining their activities and can
 engage in sports or other social activities. Families and
 friends are allowed to visit with reasonable frequency. Also,
 former prisoners at the Gebi Palace prison, which held mostly
 high-ranking officials from the Emperor's government, report
 that they were well treated, although their quarters were
 crowded and damp and they were allowed brief visits from family
 members only once a year.
 Because families are responsible for bringing food and clean
 linen, prisoners are often well-fed athough feeding prisoners
 frequently places a severe financial and personal burden on
 families. There is no evidence that political prisoners are
 deliberately subjected to living conditions worse than those of
 convicted criminals. Persons convicted of corruption tend to
 receive harsher sentences than other criminals. Such convic-
 tions often carry terms of hard labor as well as imprisonment.
 There have been instances of forced agricultural labor among
 families involved in a program of resettlement from the Welo
 region to Wellega (a program undertaken because much of Welo's
101
 soil can no longer support its population). Workers on these
 farms reportedly still live in very poor conditions. There have
 also been reports for several years of forced agricultural labor
 in Gondar region at harvest time.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Most arrests made by government security forces are made secret-
 ly. In 1982 several hundred suspected supporters of Eritrean
 and Tigrean insurgencies were arrested secretly in Addis Ababa
 alone. Some foreigners who had contact with these individuals
 also were briefly detained. Certain Ethiopians employed at the
 United Nations in Addis Ababa were lured from UN premises with
 promises of packages at the post office or false news of emergen-
 cies at home, only to be arrested by security forces. It is a
 general practice of the security forces to avoid giving family
 members or friends knowledge of the victim's detention or
 interrogation.
 The usual grounds for detention on political grounds is suspicion
 of support for one of the former political parties, affiliation
 with a *subversive" religious group or association with ethnic
 insurgent groups opposing the Government. Although habeas corpus
 still exists in the law, it does not provide protection in
 practice.
 There is no legal time limit for holding a suspect without formal
 charges. Some officials of the former Government were held as
 much as eight years without any sort of investigation or interro-
 gation.
 On September 11, 1982, to commemorate the eighth anniversary
 of the revolution, 716 prisoners were released. The names
 of most of those released were not published, but among them
 were a large number of senior officials of the former regime,
 including ministers, deputy ministers, military officers, and
 senior clergy of the Orthodox Church. Admasse Zelleke and Zewde
 Bedada, former deputies in the International Parliamentary
 Union, were reported to have been released earlier in the year.
 Women from the former royal family were not released. There are
 conflicting reports about the total remaining number of political
 prisoners, which is virtually impossible to estimate. If the
 total includes those taken prisoner as a result of ethnic
 insurgencies, it could well number in the thousands. Amnesty
 International believes "some thousands" of political prisoners
 are still being held; these include supporters of banned politi-
 cal parties or opposition groups, members of ethnic groups
 associated with secessionist movements, and people associated
 with the former imperial government (the Amnesty International
 report was compiled before the release of the 716 prisoners).
 As a result of the Revolution Day releases, two of the prisons
 for political detainees, the Gebi prison and Fourth Division
 prison, have been closed.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There is no real separation between the executive branch of
 the military Government and the judiciary. Courts are subject
 to political control. The cases of individuals arrested on
 political grounds are usually decided administratively by the
 security authorities; the outcome of political cases often
 appears to be arbitrary.
 Civilians are not usually tried in military courts unless they
 are important cases, or have been caught in armed insurrection.
 
 
 102
 Petty offenses, both political and criminal, are settled by
 kebele tribunals.
 A trial is not a guarantee of fair disposition of a case. Four
 years ago, former Minister of Mines Teshoma, who had been de-
 tained since 1975, was given a military trial and cleared of
 all charges, but nonetheless remained imprisoned until the 1982
 amnesty. Although there have been reports that a system of
 administrative review of cases may be instituted, there is no
 indication that such a system is in fact operating.
 For criminal trials, court appointed lawyers are available on
 a system under which private lawyers serve on a rotating volun-
 tary basis.
 A special court for the anti-corruption campaign was recently
 created by the Government and has begun to operate. There is
 concern among Ethiopians and observers that it may be used to
 punish ideological deviants as well as corrupt officials.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Warrants are not required for entry or search of homes or
 offices, and forced entry is practiced by security forces and
 police. The widespread house-to-house searches of several years
 ago no longer take place. During the Red Terror, families were
 often arrested and taken from their houses in the middle of the
 night by security organizations on various levels. Searches are
 less frequent now, but may also be made selectively to obtain
 military recruits. There are reliable reports that the public
 security forces engage in audio and telephone surveillence.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech is severely restricted in Ethiopia. Government
 control over the media (newspapers, TV, radio) and other forms
 of expression is absolute and firmly enforced. The media are
 government-owned and operated. Political cadres are assigned to
 all major organizations, military units, schools, and government
 offices to insure political conformity. Weekly ideological
 indoctrination sessions are required in all work places.
 Academic freedom is circumscribed, notably in political and
 social sciences. Public school curricula strongly reflect
 Marxist-Leninist doctrine. At the university level, there is
 apparently more flexibility in academic matters, although no
 criticism of the Government is allowed in this or other fora.
 The last major organized political opposition group was elimi-
 nated in the 1977-78 Red Terror. Since then, those suspected of
 engaging in active opposition to the Government are detained for
 questioning or arrested. There is, however, an apparent official
 tolerance of persons known to be out of sympathy with the regime.
 Although watched, they are allowed to go about their business as
 long as they are under no suspicion of active opposition.
 All books, foreign and domestic, are subject to censorship.
 Some issues of foreign news magazines are banned, and "Newsweek"
 has informed subscribers that the Government will no longer
 allow its importation because of an article it published that
 was critical of Ethiopia. Addis Ababa University refuses to
 allow American news magazines donated by USIA to be circulated
 in the libraries because they do not comply with censorship
 
 
 103
 regulations. From time to time a decision is made that a cer-
 tain book, Ethiopian or foreign, is counter to. the revolution.
 Every copy of the book is then ordered confiscated from book
 stores. Some foreign correspondents leaving Addis Ababa have
 been required to have their notes and papers cleared by the
 censor prior to departure.
 Since the revolution, publications in various Ethiopian regional
 languages other than Amharic, the national language, have appear-
 ed. Such publications were discouraged under the previous
 government, but have been encouraged since then.
 All levels of the Government are involved in suppression of free-
 dom of speech and press. Informer systems are becoming institu-
 tionalized in Ethiopia in the form of kebeles and workers control
 committees. Despite the end of the excesses of the Red Terror,
 there is still fear among Ethiopians that their neighbors and
 kebele officials will report on their activities. It has been
 credibly alleged that the Government engages in electronic sur-
 veillance, including tapping the telephones of suspected counter-
 revolutionaries, and thereis some evidence that international
 mail is screened.
 b.   Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association do not exist in Ethiopia.
 All mass organizations, such as trade unions, youth, peasant,
 and women's organizations, are government-created and controlled.
 No independent organizations are allowed. Trade unions are not
 a vehicle for the expression of worker grievances and interests.
 The 1982 proclamations on the organization of trade unions and
 on peasant association consolidation made it clear that the
 Government designed these organizations to increase politi-
 cal control over the population and to provide a vehicle for
 political indoctrination. Workers and farmers are required to
 join these government-created institutions.
 The International Labor Organization has expressed concern about
 the labor proclamation, which places severe restrictions on
 strike activity, and about the non-inclusion of certain workers
 in unions. There is in practice no right to strike in Ethiopia.
 Article 106 of the 1975 labor proclamation establishes that it is
 unlawful to strike unless the dispute is first referred to the
 labor division of the high court. The decision rendered by this
 body is final. Theoretically a strike might be possible should
 the high court take more than 50 days to reach a decision. How-
 ever, this is not known ever to have occurred and there have been
 no.known strikes in Ethiopia since the creation of the current
 Government.
 In the past, professional organizations such as the bar associa-
 tion had been prevented through intimidation from attempts to
 maintain international contacts. There is evidence, however,
 that professional associations have felt freer to reopen contacts
 in the past year. Rotary and Lions clubs continue to function
 freely in Addis Ababa, though their membership is substantially
 foreign.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although freedom of religion is officially recognized in Ethi-
 opia, both the Orthodox Church and other religious denominations
 have been subjected to varying degrees of harassment since the
 revolution.
 
 iSq"*R n - aq-.
 
 
 104
 After the revolution, the Orthodox Church was removed from its
 position as the official state religion and most of its land
 holdings were nationalized. The Government announced in late 1981
 that the role of churches in the future would be restricted to
 purely religious matters. All church schools, hospitals,
 training programs, and property not strictly used for religious
 purposes would be taken over by the Government. In May 1982,
 Mathias, the former Archbishop of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church
 in Jerusalem, publicly stated in New York that the Ethiopian
 Orthodox Church was being subjected to repression. In support
 of his claim, he alleged executions and arrests of Orthodox
 clergy. There have been no other reports, however, of actions.
 in 1982 against the Ethiopian Orthodox Church or against Islam.
 International Christian religious observers say the Orthodox
 Church operates freely and that attendance at religious services
 has increased markedly in recent years. International Moslem
 observers report satisfaction with the status of Islam under the
 current regime.
 Other groups, mainly certain evangelist Protestant churches
 associated with missionaries, have been subjected to various
 kinds of official harassment. However, some foreign Protestant
 missionaries report no interference in their activities.
 The Government charges that certain Protestant churches engage
 in "anti-revolutionary activities under the cover of religion."
 The Government apparently suspects the Mekane Yesus (Evangelist
 Lutheran) Church of being connected to the Oromo Liberation
 Front. Since the arrest of certain members of the Mekane
 Yesus Church on these grounds and the takeover of the Church's
 headquarters in Addis Ababa in 1981, it is understood that
 some church members have been released and some churches
 that were closed have been allowed to reopen. However, Mekane
 Yesus' General Secretary, Pastor Gudina Tumsa, has not been
 released since his abduction in July 1979, and no information
 has been made available about his whereabouts, or the condition
 of his wife who is also in prison. In early 1982, local govern-
 ment officials monitored annual regional church meetings of the
 Mekane Yesus and Seventh Day Adventist churches. Some Mekane
 Yesus officials in Wellega were arrested at the close of these
 meetings and later tried, fined, and released. Seventh Day
 Adventist youths were reportedly jailed for several months for
 refusing to participate in literacy campaign activities on their
 sabbath, even though they volunteered to work on another day. A
 number of other Protestant denominations, as well as the Catholic
 Church, also suffered harassment during 1982.
 Falasha Jews have also suffered from obstacles to the practice
 of their religion. Estimates of the number of Ethiopian Jews,
 known as Falashas, vary considerably, with 25,000 a frequently-
 cited figure. They live primarily in primitive villages in
 Gondar and Tigre administrative regions. Before the revolution,
 the Falasha were prohibited from owning land and suffered from
 other severe discrimination. Their general material situation
 improved as a result of the 1974 revolution, which gave them de
 facto ownership of arable land. In the religious and cultural
 areas, Falashas are worse off since mid-1981 than other ethnic
 groups in Gondar Province. No information is available on
 Falashas in Tigre; visits by foreigners to that area are not
 permitted owing to the insurgency. The Orthodox Christian
 population of Gondar has access to churches, whereas in 1981 the
 Government, alleging maladministration, closed synagogues and
 schools established for Falashas by the Organization for Rehabil-
 itation and Training, an international group based in Switzer-
 land. The largest of these schools has now been reopened at
 certain grade levels by the Government. The office of the
 
 
 105
 Organization for Rehabilitation and Training in Addis Ababa was
 closed in 1982.
 Recent visitors to Gondar report that while the Falashas
 are generally quite poor, like other people in the area, and
 live in primitive conditions, there is no starvation among
 them.
 The Falasha, like other Ethiopians, are prevented from emigrat-
 ing from Ethiopia. It has been reported that many would like to
 emigrate to Israel.
 Conversion from one faith to another is permitted. The Govern-
 ment tries to discourage adherence to any faith in its attempt
 to wean traditionally religious Ethiopians away from the organ-
 ized churches.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement. within Ethiopia generally is not impeded by the Govern-
 ment, although identification cards are required. Travel to
 Eritrea (a war zone) requires permission. Those suspected of
 counterrevolutionary activity may be limited to travel within
 the administrative region in which they live, and religious
 leaders, including Protestants and Falasha, have been denied
 permission to travel to neighboring congregations.
 Private travel abroad is very difficult for Ethiopians. An
 elaborate clearance procedure is require, and a financial guar-
 antor to assure one's return usually must be found. Permission
 to travel abroad may be denied to those not considered politi-
 cally reliable.
 The right to emigrate is not generally recognizeds however,
 many Ethiopians continue to take advantage of any opportunity
 to leave the country. In November 1981, a government proclama-
 tion stated that illegally leaving the country was a treasonable
 offense punishable by five-to-twenty-five years rigorous impris-
 onment, or in grave circumstances, death. Ethiopian lawyers
 have expressed the-opinion that this provision applies only to
 Ethiopians who clandestinely cross into neighboring countries
 such as Somalia and the Sudan. Nevertheless, it is estimated
 that more than a million Ethiopians have fled to surrounding
 countries as refugees, or requested asylum in Western countries,
 as the result of ethnic insurgencies and the revolution.
 The right of voluntary repatriation is recognized, and many have
 reportedly returned from neighboring countries. The Government
 has proclaimed mass amnesty decrees for Ethiopians living abroad.
 It has also issued individual invitations to return. The decrees
 and invitations, however, lack guarantees and are not uncondi-
 tional. Some Ethiopians who have taken advantage of individual
 or general amnesties have been given jobs and housing and have
 been well-treated.
 Some Ethiopian refugees in Djibouti were forcibly repatriated
 to Ethiopia in February, 1982. On arrival in Ethiopia, some of
 them were given a choice between paying an exhorbitant fine or
 facing several months in prison. Some were reportedly put on
 display with a fee charged the public to see them. The November
 1981 proclamation, providing even more severe penalties, was not
 enforced against these returnees.
 Ethiopian authorities have imprisoned some Somali refugees. In
 June, several of those imprisoned in Addis Ababa were reportedly
 executed.
 
 
 106
 Except for around 5,000 Sudanese refugees said to be living in
 Ethiopia, there are no significant concentrations of refugees
 in the country.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Ethiopia's military Government exercises tight control over all
 aspects of society. No effective avenues exist for popular
 participation in decision-making; all significant matters are
 decided in camera by the senior levels of the Government, headed
 by Chairman Mengistu Haile-Mariam. Important issues are usually
 referred to the Chairman himself.
 The only form of "political involvement" available to the citizenry
 is the various organizations created by the Government to implement
 its social and political goals. Chairman Mengistu has publicly
 pressed for progress in transforming the Commission for Organiz-
 ing the Party of the Working People of Ethiopia (COPWE), the
 primary political arm of the Government, into an official party.
 The proposed party, which would be the only one allowed in
 Ethiopia, will presumably be modeled after the Communist Party
 of the Soviet Union. All elections to the mass organizations
 are carefully controlled by COPWE; all candidates for positions
 are approved by it prior to elections. No opposition to the
 Government is tolerated.
 The kebeles and peasant associations are the most important
 government-created organizations at the local level. Both
 have enabled the Government to increase its control over the
 population. The women's association, organized from the
 national to the local level, has-the proclaimed goal of improv-
 ing the status of women. It is also intended to establish a
 broader base of support for the regime. Although women are
 being encouraged to participate fully in authorized economic and
 political activities, they are not represented at the top of the
 power hierarchy. Moreover, the organization created to promote
 their rights is controlled by COPWE and has no effective program
 or power. The youth and labor associations, established to
 control, to indoctrinate, and to expand the regime's base of
 support, also have no independent policies or programs. Ethi-
 opia's diverse ethnic groups have been permitted no political
 autonomy by the Government.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged violations of
 Human Rights
 In general, Ethiopia has been opposed to international and non-
 governmental attempts to improve protection of human rights. It
 strenuously objected to the United Nations Human Rights Commis-
 sion's consideration of its human rights record from 1978-1981
 and accorded the UN minimal cooperation. The UN Commission,
 under its special confidential (1503) procedures for dealing
 with "consistent patterns" of gross violations of human rights,
 investigated and reported on violations in Ethiopia for four
 years. When the anti-slavery commission presented a report to
 the UN working group on slavery in 1980 alleging forced labor in
 Ethiopia, the Government responded with an angry note. It
 similarly denied the cases of disappearances contained in the
 report of the UN working group on enforced and involuntary
 disappearance in 1982.
 Organizations which criticize Ethiopia's human rights record
 are denounced by the Government as politically motivated.
 
 
 107
 Amnesty International's letters and petitions to the Government
 have rarely, if ever, been answered. The Government does not
 permit the formation of government or private organizations
 which concern themselves with human rights.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Ethiopia is among the poorest countries in the world. The
 economic goals proclaimed by the Ethiopian Government since the
 1974 revolution have been to reduce inequalities and raise the
 standard of living for the bulk of its population. In addition
 to widespread nationalizations and land reform, the implementa-
 tion of these objectives has involved central planning, govern-
 ment control of production and distribution, and the use of mass
 organizations to mobilize peasants and urban dwellers to
 achieve economic goals. While these programs have resulted in
 an overall increase in food consumption in rural areas, they
 have not significantly improved the economy. Overcentraliza-
 tion has strained the Government's managerial capabilities
 and resulted in considerable inefficiency.
 The Government does not officially approve discrimination on
 the basis of sex, religion, or ethnic affiliation. In some
 instances, however, the Government appears to tolerate such
 discrimination, particularly against certain ethnic groups and
 on religious grounds. A 'new class" appears to be developing of
 those connected to the Government and COPWE who enjoy good hous-
 ing and jobs and who can avoid the food shortages and the other
 difficulties of the general population.
 Women in the central Ethiopian cultures (Oromo, Amhara, and
 Tigre) have traditionally enjoyed economic rights equally with
 men. They may inherit, buy or sell property, and engage in
 business. Women, however, traditionally are limited to more
 circumscribed roles in political, modern economic, and religious
 spheres of life. village leadership is male, and all clergy are
 male. Women have a subjugated status within the home, and child
 marriages are common. The Government is beginning to challenge
 these traditional limitations on women's roles, except in the
 religious sphere. Some groups in Ethiopia practice female
 circumcision.
 Health conditions are very poor. Although medical care is free,
 countrywide there is only one physician for every 75,000 people
 and one nurse per 5,320 people. Almost all health facilities
 are in or near cities and towns. Only about two percent of the
 rural population and 32 percent of the urban population have
 reasonable access to safe water. Malaria has recently increased
 in scope.
 Food grain production has fluctuated from year to year without a
 steady trend; however, increasing population and urbanization
 have resulted in significant net grain deficits each year. Low
 productivity also has been reported on collective and state
 farms.. Late and sparse rains could result in a reduced food
 production level for 1982. Food shortages have resulted in.
 rationing of basic foodstuffs.
 The Government is devoting much attention to its basic education
 progranm and to the expansion of higher education. In both urban
 and rural areas, hundreds of thousands of adults are learning to
 read, write, and do simple arithmetic as part of the Government's
 literacy campaign, which was launched in 1979. It is conducted
 in many regional languages. High school youth and teachers have
 been recruited into teaching corps for this purpose. Consider-
 able pressure is exerted to ensure participation in the program.
 
 
 108
 Absence from literacy classes may-be punished. From 1970 through
 1977 the adult literacy rate increased significantly from 6
 percent to 15 percent. The Government currently claims that the
 literacy rate has been raised to 35 percent. The percentage of
 children of primary school age enrolled in schools has similarly
 risen from 16 percent to 35 percent between 1970 and 1979. The
 primary school enrollment ratio is 48 percent for males and 24
 percent for females. The increase in enrollment has placed a
 considerable burden on the school system reflected in inadequate
 facilities and insufficient numbers of teachers. Children
 attend classes in three shifts per day, with an average of 60
 students per class. The right of women to equal education is
 stressed by the Government. University level education has also
 been expanded and enrollment is now over ten thousand.
 Political indoctrination has been introduced into the school
 system at all levels, reflected in the books used and in the
 ideological conformity expected of the students. University
 students frequently are required to follow courses of study
 prescribed by the Government and are forced to take assigned
 jobs after graduation.
 The World Bank estimates that the GNP per capita in Ethiopia
 does not exceed $140. In 1977, 60 percent of the urban popula-
 tion and 65 percent of the rural population fell below the
 poverty income levels. Income growth has suffered from dislo-
 cations of the revolution, the diversion of resources from
 development to military needs, managerial problems, the inability
 of the system to provide adequate incentives to farmers, workers,
 and businessmen, as well as some covert resistance to economic
 policies. On the basis of government figures, growth of GNP
 averaged 2.2 percent since 1974. On the other hand, population
 growth appears to have accelerated (Ethiopia's first census is
 currently under preparation and is scheduled to begin in 1983).
 World Bank statistics indicate a population growth rate of 2.1
 percent for the 1970-79 period, but a growth rate of 2.6 percent
 for 1980. As the 1977 poverty level statistics indicate, low
 living standards are particularly striking in the urban areas.
 Salaries for most workers have been frozen since 1976, although
 the Government has allowed increases for the very lowest paid.
 Endemic inflation has eroded real income and consumption for
 all. Efforts at price control do more to create shortages than
 to hold down costs of necessities.
 In 1975, the Government nationalized all rural land. User rights
 for up to 10 hectares were allocated to farmers willing to till
 the land themselves. This measure abolished large private land
 holdings and tenant farming and allowed many farmers to till
 their own fields for the first time, but destroyed the old
 system whereby surplus agricultural productibn (collected as
 rent on fields) was sent by land owners to market in the cities.
 The new system, which permits individual farmers to retain their
 produce if they wish, has resulted in a shortage in the amount
 of food available in the cities, as the Government does not
 offer a high enough price to induce farmers to produce more than
 they need themselves. Thus Ethiopia, once a net exporter of
 food grains, is now a net importer.
 Overall, the lot of the rural population is thought to have
 improved since the revolution, but not that of the urban poor.
 Since land reform eliminated tenant labor on farms, peasants now
 may keep as much of their produce as they wish. The Government
 tries to buy surplus grain from the peasantry at low prices for
 sale in the cities, but farmers are given little incentive to
 produce more than they need for their own use. As a result, the
 
 
 109
 peasantry is well-fed, but there are extensive grain shortages
 in the cities. The standard of living of the urban poor is
 lower than it was prior to the revolution, as the cost of living
 has increased more sharply than their wage increases.
 Rights relating to ownership of private property have been
 significantly curtailed. Ethiopians whose properties were
 nationalized were neither paid nor promised compensation. The
 remains of the private sector play only a limited and fragile
 role in Ethiopia. Real personal property and business property
 remain subject to nationalization. The Government rigorously
 controls access to credit, foreign exchange, and licenses as
 well as most other aspects of business conduct. More than the
 fact of this control, the uncertainty and capriciousness sur-
 rounding such control depresses private investment and business.
