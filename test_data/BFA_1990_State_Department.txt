 BURKINA FASO
 Burkina Faso is ruled by a military regime headed by Captain
 Blaise Compaore who took power from Thomas Sankara on October
 15, 1987, in the country's fourth military coup since 1980.
 Compaore has since reinforced a narrow political base by
 forming a "Popular Front" of leftwing and centrist groups,
 military officers, and politically unaffiliated civilians to
 assist in running the Government. At the first Popular Front
 Congress in March, Compaore initiated a process of political
 and constitutional reform. A new draft constitution was
 approved by a national convention in mid-December that
 provides the potential for evolution to a multiparty system
 and the rule of law.
 Burkina Faso's security apparatus consists of the armed
 forces, including the paramilitary gendarmerie and the police,
 which have primary responsibility for internal security. All
 police and internal security forces are controlled by the
 Ministry of Defense. The police continued to be responsible
 for human rights abuses, including mistreatment of detainees.
 Burkina Faso is overwhelmingly dependent on subsistence
 agriculture that is highly vulnerable to variable rainfall.
 Frequent drought, lack of communications, and poor
 infrastructure, as well as a low literacy rate, are all
 longstanding problems. The country has a per capita income of
 around $200 per year.
 Human rights continued to be circumscribed in 1990. Problem
 areas were arbitrary detentions, mistreatment of detainees,
 restrictions on freedom of the press and worker rights, and
 the inability of citizens to change their government through
 peaceful means. Nevertheless, the situation has improved
 since the Sankara era, as evidenced in the emerging debate
 over constitutional reform and in the authorization of a
 number of new political groups, some of which became openly
 critical of the Popular Front toward the end of the year. The
 Government also continued to tolerate a local human rights
 organization.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There have been no confirmed extrajudicial killings since the
 summary executions of four members of the armed forces in
 September 1989 for allegedly plotting a coup d'etat. After
 another coup attempt at in late December 1989, the Government
 denied rumors that seven people had been executed and said all
 those arrested would receive trials. These trials did not
 take place in 1990, and rumors persist that one of those
 detained, Professor Guillaume Sessouma, died in captivity
 after being beaten by police. In October the Burkinabe
 Movement for Human Rights (MBDHP) called on the Government to
 produce Sessouma and Dabo Boukary, a student reported to also
 have died in detention after mistreatment by police, or admit
 their deaths, launch an inquiry, and punish those
 responsible. The Government did not respond specifically to
 these cases, but shortly after the MBDHP communique it
 produced other political prisoners for view by the official
 press. At year's end the fate of both men remained unknown.
 
 
 BURKINA FASO
 b. Disappearance
 Other than the cases mentioned above, there were no reports of
 politically motivated disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although legally prohibited, torture and mistreatment of
 detainees have been persistent problems for a number of
 years. Police brutality has continued since Amnesty
 International (AI) published a special report in 1988 on
 political imprisonment and torture. Such mistreatment was
 inflicted on those in official custody and was particularly
 evident during student protests at the University of
 Ouagadougou in May when police severely beat student
 protesters (see Section 2.b.). There were no known actions
 taken by the Government to end these practices or to punish
 those responsible for them.
 Prison conditions are poor, with most prisons holding double
 their designed capacity. Conditions are further characterized
 by the lack of sufficient food and minimum hygiene and medical
 support.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although Burkina Faso's law provides for expeditious
 arraignment and trial, access to legal counsel, and the right
 of appeal, these rights are rarely observed, particularly in
 political or security cases.
 There were continuing reports in 1990 of arbitrary arrest.
 The law permits preventive detention without charge for a
 maximum of 72 hours, renewable for a single 72-hour period in
 criminal cases. In practice, rights are rarely observed in
 national security and political cases. More than 40 students
 were held in incommunicado detention without charge for
 several months after the disturbances of May. Some were
 released, but AI reports that 8 were forcibly conscripted into
 the armed forces, and at least 16 remained in incommunicado
 detention. The MBDHP urged the Government to release the
 remaining students (see Section 2.b.). In addition, in
 security and political cases, the military code, which
 provides for indefinite detention, overrides the civil code.
 Access to lawyers is not usually permitted in security cases,
 although it is provided for by law.
 The Compaore regime has made a practice of detaining political
 opponents. Many were released in August 1989. However, some
 of them were rearrested in September 1989 after the discovery
 of the alleged coup plot and, together with those arrested
 after the Christmas 1989 coup attempt, continued to be held
 through 1990. The MBDHP was granted access to the detainees
 in January; it reported no evidence of torture or mistreatment.
 Some intellectuals, ex-military officers, and former
 Government officials remain in self-imposed exile abroad,
 partly due to fear for their safety should they return.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The legal code guarantees the rights to public trial, access
 to counsel, and to appeal convictions. These rights are
 generally respected in the normal court system, but they are
 
 
 BURKINA FASO
 suspended in the people's revolutionary courts, which
 generally hear corruption cases. The regular court system,
 patterned after the French system, continues to function for
 most criminal and civil cases, and defendants usually receive
 a fair trial. Military courts have jurisdiction in security
 and political cases and are convened on an ad hoc basis. The
 Government appoints civil service attorneys to represent those
 who do not wish to retain or cannot afford a private attorney.
 In the people's revolutionary courts, cases are susceptible to
 interference by the Executive. Revolutionary court judges
 include not only magistrates but also military personnel and
 members of revolutionary committees, who usually do not have
 any formal legal training. The court president asks questions
 directly of the defendant, and no legal representation is
 permitted.
 The number of political prisoners, including political
 detainees, was estimated to be about 30 at the end of 1990.
 Those persons implicated in the Christmas coup attempt were
 finally scheduled to come to trial early in 1991, probably
 before a special military court convened specifically for the
 case. Pressure from local and international human rights
 groups has led the Government to permit those charged in the
 Christmas coup attempt to have access to legal representation.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Government authorities generally do not interfere in the daily
 lives of ordinary citizens, and there is no general monitoring
 of private correspondence or telephones, except in national
 security cases. Under the law homes may be searched only
 under the authority of a warrant issued by the Attorney
 General. In national security cases, however a special law
 permits surveillance, searches, and monitoring of telephones
 and correspondence without a warrant. The Government
 encourages participation in its revolutionary committees and
 also in the four so-called popular structures, organizations
 formed to group together the youth, women, elders, and
 peasants of Burkina Faso. Civil servants who did not
 participate in the revolutionary committees found their
 chances for advancement limited.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are not guaranteed by law, and the
 Government controls the media. The Government also employs
 methods of intimidation to limit freedom of speech. Repeated
 references by the regime to enemies of the State at home and
 abroad inhibit ordinary citizens from expressing critical
 views. Similarly, the Government used dismissals from
 government service and arbitrary arrest to quell debate on
 political topics. While the Government used these powers to
 limit the ability of opposition parties to convey their
 message to the public, it permitted an increasingly open
 political dialog on Burkina Faso's future, particularly toward
 the end of the year. Delegates at the March National Congress
 of the Popular Front held a heated debate on freedom of the
 press, for example. A similarly open debate took place at the
 national constitutional convention in December 1990.
 Formal censorship of the press is unnecessary, since most
 media outlets in Burkina Faso are government owned and
 
 
 BURKINA FASO
 controlled and fall under the direction of the Minister of
 Information. Journalists are civil servants and do not engage
 in serious criticism of the Government and may be replaced for
 failing to support the political views of the Government. The
 official press is selective in its reporting and provided no
 coverage of an MDBHP-sponsored seminar on human rights and the
 Constitution in August. Despite the lack of advance
 publicity, some 400 to 500 people attended the seminar. In
 1989, a private newspaper, L'Observateur, attempted to publish
 its first edition since it was burned down in 1984. The
 Government quickly stepped in to prevent publication,
 ostensibly because the newspaper did not have the proper
 permits. No permits were granted in 1990.
 The Government unveiled in 1990 a new-information code that
 permits private publications for the first time since 1987.
 The code establishes the right to information as fundamental
 but requires that this right be exercised with "strict
 respect" for cultural and moral values and the political
 orientation of Burkina Paso. Several independent journals,
 published by various political groups, appeared in 1990. They
 and the quarterly journal of the Burkinabe Human Rights
 Movement (MBDHP), Liberte, have not been subject to government
 censorship. Those working.on the MBDHP journal are not
 licensed journalists under the information code.
 Foreign newspapers and magazines entered the country freely in
 1990. The new code provides, however, that in the future such
 publications must be deposited with the Ministry of
 Information before they can be sold. In 1990 foreign
 journalists traveled freely, filed stories without censorship,
 and enjoyed access to government officials. There is no
 interference with international radio broadcasts.
 Academic freedom is limited (see Section 2.b.).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Compaore Government initially continued the Sankara
 regime's ban on political parties, but in 1990 it permitted
 some political parties to organize and hold political
 meetings. It remains necessary for parties to seek
 administrative permission for their meetings, but such
 permission is generally granted without question. Some of the
 more centrist parties accepted the Government's invitation to
 join the Popular Front, though others have chosen to remain
 outside it. Open criticism of the Government became
 increasingly apparent toward the end of 1990, and a variety of
 groups were active at the December national constitutional
 convention, contesting positions of the Popular Front and
 advancing their own political views.
 The limits of the Government's tolerance of political
 activity, however, were evident in May when police forcibly
 intervened at the campus of Ouagadougou University to break up
 students' attempts to organize a protest against government
 educational policies. In the ensuing fracas bystanders were
 arrested, and some students were badly beaten by soldiers and
 police. Many of the students, including Clement Bagre, the
 national student representative to the constitutional
 commission, were held without charge in various military
 facilities throughout Burkina Faso for several months. The
 Government also permanently prohibited the return to the
 university of any student involved in the protest, effectively
 ending their academic careers. In July the MBDHP called for
 
 
 28
 BURKINA FASO
 the release of the remaining detained students, the
 readmission of students expelled from the university, equal
 access for all students to university services, and an end to
 investigation of accused students. There was no known
 response from by the Government by the end of the year. The
 National Student Association protested the Government's
 actions by boycotting the December constitutional convention
 and circulating a tract condemning the continued government
 stonewalling.
 Nonpolitical associations for business, religious, cultural,
 and other purposes exist and experience no difficulty in
 obtaining permission to meet or in associating with
 international bodies in their fields.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Burkina Faso is a secular state, and there is no official
 discrimination on religious grounds. Islam and Christianity
 exist side by side, with about 40 percent of the population
 Muslim and about 15 percent Christian. The remainder of the
 population practices traditional African religions. Muslim
 and Christian holidays are recognized as national holidays.
 Social mobility and access to modern sector jobs are neither
 linked to, nor restricted by, religious affiliations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travelers within Burkina Faso are routinely stopped at police
 and military checkpoints. There appears to be little
 restriction on foreign travel for business and tourism. Exit
 permits, once used to limit movements of workers to
 neighboring countries, particularly to Cote D'Ivoire, where 2
 million or more Burkinabe continue to reside and work, are no
 longer required.
 Refugees are accepted freely in Burkina Faso, and attempts are
 made to provide for their care in cooperation with the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. There were
 approximately 270 refugees and displaced persons in Burkina
 Faso at the end of 1989, mainly from Chad, but most of these
 departed in 1990. In January the Government expelled--without
 explanations--several hundred Ghanaians who had been living
 legally in Burkina Faso.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government
 through democratic procedures, although discussions began in
 1990 on constitutional reform, and some political groupings
 were authorized to organize and meet. The military have
 dominated the political process since 1980 through four
 changes in leadership and gave clear signals in 1990 that the
 process of reform will be carefully controlled from the top.
 Up to now, President Compaore has relied on a rather narrow
 grouping of people, including military officers, to help run
 the Government and on a loose network of revolutionary
 committees throughout the country to mobilize popular
 support.
 At the end of 1990, a national convention adopted a new draft
 constitution which, if fully implemented, could lead to
 greater popular participation in the political process. At
 
 
 BURKINA FASO
 the first National Congress of the Popular Front in March,
 President Compaore announced a plan to "broaden the base" of
 the Government. In May a 104-member commission, with
 representatives from political, labor, religious, and legal
 organizations, was named by the Popular Front to draft a
 constitution. Despite criticism, the Front named the
 president and vice-president of the commission. A
 constitutional referendum, originally planned for November,
 was rescheduled until June 1991. If approved, the
 constitution would be implemented in late 1991. It calls for
 direct election of representatives to the proposed National
 Assembly and of the President and provides for an independent
 judiciary, and for freedom of the press and expression.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has continued to tolerate the activities of the
 Burkinabe Movement for the Rights of Men and Peoples (MBDHP),
 an independent group composed mostly of students and
 professionals, led by the president of the Administrative
 Chamber of the High Court. Movement leaders have been
 permitted to organize forums on constitutional and human
 rights issues, at which discussion has been impressively free
 and open; they have also published a quarterly journal. MBDHP
 functions, however, have been studiously ignored by the
 Government press. In February the MBDHP marked its first
 anniversary with a series of well-attended discussions of
 human rights issues, including the excessive role of the
 military Government, the arbitrary nature of revolutionary
 justice, and the absence of a free press. The authorities did
 not intervene in the proceedings. In August some 400 to 500
 people attended an MBDHP-sponsored conference in which members
 of the constitutional commission were questioned closely on
 what human rights guarantees were included in the draft
 constitution. There were no reports of reprisals against
 participants. MBDHP represehtatives have also been able, in
 some cases, to ensure that political detainees have not been
 mistreated and had access to their families.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination on the basis of race, religion, or ethnic
 origin is illegal under both current law and the draft
 constitution. In practice, such discrimination does not occur
 on a wide scale; minority ethnic groups are as likely to be
 represented in the inner circles of the Government as are
 majority Mossi, and government decisions do not favor one
 group over another.
 In the largely rural society of Burkina Faso, women continue
 to occupy a subordinate position and face discrimination in
 such areas as education, jobs, property, and family rights.
 Women make up one-fourth of the government work force, usually
 in lower paying positions, which represents one-third of the
 total salaried work force in the country. Women make up
 approximately one-third of the total student population in the
 primary, secondary, and advanced school systems. Schools in
 rural areas have disproportionately fewer girls than schools
 in urban areas.
 Violence against women, especially wife beating, occurs fairly
 frequently in rural areas, less often in cities. The
 
 
 BURKINA FASO
 Government is attempting to educate people on the subject
 through the media. Specific cases of violence against women
 can be brought before the National Women's Association (UFB)
 which attempts to offer protection and counsel. Such cases
 are sometimes brought before a "Popular Conciliation
 Tribunal," composed of community representatives, for
 mediation.
 The Government has made a particularly strong commitment to
 eradicate female genital mutilation through widespread
 educational efforts. Female circumcision still occurs in many
 rural areas, although it js becoming less common in urban
 centers. Another form of mutilation is by scarring the faces
 of both boys and girls of certain ethnic groups. This is
 rapidly disappearing. The UFB takes a leadership role in both
 campaigns.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have traditionally had the legal right to association,
 although the Government has prevented the unions from engaging
 in activities it opposes and appears to have forced recent
 leadership changes in three unions to ensure more compliance
 with government labor policy. Once among the most powerful
 political actors in the country, organized labor lost much of
 its influence under the Sankara and Compaore military
 regimes.
 Organized labor has the legal right to strike, but in practice
 this right no longer exists. The Compaore Government has not
 faced major labor unrest, and there were no strikes in 1990.
 The Committee of Experts of the International Labor
 Organizations (ILO) noted with satisfaction in 1989 that all
 the teachers dismissed following a strike that year had been
 reinstated, and that all sanctions against officials had been
 lifted.
 The largest federation, the National Organization of Free
 Trade Unions (ONSL), is affiliated with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions. The ONSL underwent a
 wrenching internal struggle in 1990 that left it seriously
 weakened. A leftist federation is affiliated with the
 Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions.
 Burkina Faso's five federations take turns representing labor
 at ILO meetings and African labor meetings, and all had the
 opportunity to participate in the drafting of a national
 constitution.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions have the right to bargain for wages and other benefits
 but only on a company-by-company basis. There are no export
 processing zones in Burkina Faso.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited by law in Burkina Faso and is not
 practiced.
 d   Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The labor code sets the minimum age for employment at 14, the
 average age for completion of basic secondary school
 
 
 31
 BURKINA FASO
 However, the Government lacks the means to enforce this
 provision adequately, even in the small wage sector. Most
 children actually begin work at an earlier age owing to the
 large number of small, family subsistence farms and the
 traditional apprenticeship system.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum monthly pay of about $75 and a maximum workweek of 48
 hours are stipulated by the labor code, as are safety and
 health provisions. This minimum wage is not adequate for a
 worker to support a family, and wage earners usually must
 supplement their income through the extended family and
 subsistence agriculture. There are also health and safety
 standards. A system of Government inspections under the
 Ministry of Labor and labor courts ensures that these
 provisions are applied in the small industrial and commercial
 sectors, but they have been impossible to enforce in the
 dominant subsistence agriculture sector which involves 90
 percent of the population.
