 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 Equatorial Guinea is nominally a constitutional re ublic, but in reality power is
 held by a small sublan of the majority Fang tribe wgich has ruled since the coun-
 trys independence in 1968. Despite the formalities of a multiparty form of govern-
 ment, President Obiang, in power since 1979, together with his associates, domi-
 nates the Government. The President's Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea
 (DPEG) controls the judiciary and the legislature, the latter through fraudulent
 elections.
 SPresident Obiang exercises control over the police and security forces through the
 Minister of Interior. These forces committed well-documented human rights abuses,
 including unwarranted searches, arrests, and physical abuse of prisoners in their
 custody. The authorities took no action against any security force member accused
 of human rights violations.
 The majorit of the population lives by subsistence agriculture, supplemented by
 hunting and fihig Barter is a major aspect of an economy in which the small
 monetary s      is ased on exports of petroleum, increasing quantiies of timber,
 and declining quantities of cocoa. The economic crisis is compounded by the suspen-
 sion of international assistance due to the lack of economic reform and the Govern-
 ment's continued violation of human rights.
 Serious human rights abuses continue, althogchere has been a significant dim-
 inution of abuses from 1993 levels. Nonetheless, citizens still do not have the right
 to change their government. The Government continues to use torture, arbitrary ar-
 rest, and illegal detention with impunity. It also restricts freedom of the press.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From f m
 a. Political and Other Extraf dicical  ling.mThere were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of  appearances.
 c. Torture  ma te arue I    nu , or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.--
 These abuses are serious, frequent, and widespread Government security farces ar-
 rest prominent members of the opposition, beat and torture them, and release them
 within days. Beatings are severe, and some victims require hospital care after re-
 lease. Access to prisoners while in custody is not generally permitted. The Govern-
 ment uses the psychological effect of arrest, along with the fear of future beating,
 to intimidate opposition party members. The Government has not prosecuted or
 punished any security officials for these abuses.
 Prison conditions are extremely primitive and life-threatening. Rations are highly
 inadequae and sanitary facilities range from nonexistent to minuscule. Prison a-
 thort s do not target women, but female prisoners are not housed separately from
 men. Parisn onditions are not independently monitored.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Police routinely hold persons in incom-
 municado detention. Although there are no long-term political prisoners, the Gov-
 ernment continues to arrest political figures and detain them for short periods of
 time, usually less than 1 week. Although the Government apparently no longer
 holds political prisoners for extensive periods of time without trial, the current short
 arbitrary detentions onstituted a dubimus improvement over past patterns of abuse.
 There are nominal, but unenforced, legal procedural safeguards as to detention,
 the need for search warrants, and other protection of prisoner rights. Judicial war-
 rants are required. Generally, police arrested suspc  without having obtained war-
 rants; on occasion they beat them, then released them within days.
 Authorities also continued to hold Nigerians, Ghanaians, Gabonese and others to
 secure bribes.
 The Government does not force citizens into exile and does not harass returned
 exiles.
 e. Denial f Fair Public Trail.IThe court system, composed of lower provincial
 courts, appeal courts, and a Supreme Court, is rarely used. The President appoints
 the Supreme Court, which is responsive to  fim. There are traditional courts in the
 countryside, in which elders adjudicate civil claims and minor criminal matters.
 Military courts are seldom used for political offenses; there were no reports of such
 use in 1994. There are no religious or political courts.
 The Constitution and laws passed y the Chamber of Deputies provide for legal
 representation, the right of appeal, andthe use of search warrants. In practice, au-
 thorities do not uniforny respect these provisions. Civil cases rarely come to public
 trial.
 
 
 The judiciary is not independent; judges serve at the pleasure of the President
 and are appointed, transferred and dismissed for political reasons. Corruption is re-
 prtedly rampant.
 The Government recently responded to international donor pressure by releasing
 all political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government does not enforce the law requiring judicial warrants and security forces
 conduct arbitrary searches of homes.
 The Government does not overtly force officials to join the DPEG, but lawyers,
 government staff, and others understand that party membership is necessary for
 employment and promotion.
 There is reportedly some surveillance of members of the opposition parties. There
 does not appear to be systematic interference with correspondence, and there is no
 coercive population control or forced resettlement.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press but the Government severely restricts these rights in practice. Al-
 though there is no press op position pamphlets and statements circulate.
 Government-controlled television, which broadcasts only a few hours per day, is
 the voice of the Government, and the Government withholds even minimal access
 to broadcasting from opposition parties.
 There are no universities or other institutions of higher learning in this country
 with a deteriorating educational system. The question of academic freedom is, there-
 fore, largely irrelevant.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right of assembly and as-
 sociation is provided for in the Constitution. However, the Government must author-
 ize any gathering of more than 10 persons for discussions that the regime considers
 political, even in private homes.
 The Government generally permits opposition parties to hold conferences and pri-
 vate meetings. It requires permits for public events, which it routinely grants and
 as quickly cancels, effectively undermining the right of assembly.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government generally respects freedom of religion.
 There is no state religion, and the Government does not discriminate against any
 faith. However, the Government must recognize a faith as a legally inscribed reli-
 gion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict internal travel for political, security
 reasons. Local police demand bribes from occupants of cars, taxis, and other vehicles
 traveling outside the capital. Members of opposition parties often travel abroad with
 no restrictions on their right to return.
 There are no refugees or asylum seekers.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government by democratic means.
 The Constitution nominally provides citizens with the right to change their govern-
 ment peacefully, but in fact there have been no free elections since independence
 in 1968. The President exercises complete power as Head of State, commander of
 the armed forces, and leader of the government party, the DPEG. Leadership posi-
 tions within the Government are in general restrictedo trhe President's subclan and
 closest supporters. While there is an elected Chamber of Deputies, it is not rep-
 resntative and is dominated by the Government. During 1994 there were no elec-
 tions.
 Although there are no legal restrictions on women's participation in politics, they
 are seriously underrepresented in the political process. The 42-member Cabinet has
 2 women, while the 80-member legislature has only 5 women.
 The Government does not overtly limit participation by ethnic minorities, but the
 Fang's monopolization of political power persists in spite of the Government's very
 preliminary steps toward democratization.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of.lleged Violations of Human Rights
 The first human rights organization was formed in early 1994; its registration is
 pending with the Ministry of the Interior. Another local human rights organization,
 the League for the Defense of Human Rights in Guinea, was orgaized in April. The
 Minister of the Interior had not acted on its registration request at year's end.
 Based on the Government's record of human rights abuse, many citizens are fearful
 of associating with the League.

 The United Nations Special Rapporteur for Human Rights visited Equatorial
 Guinea three times, receiving grudging government cooperation. The Government
 refused to permit the International Committee of the Red Cross to establish an of-
 fice and to visit prisons and detainees. Amnesty International visited twice.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Both governmental and societal discrimination continue to exist and is reflected
 in traditional restraints on women's education and in the circumscribed opportuni-
 ties for professional and occupational achievement for ethnic minorities. The Gov-
 ernment deliberately limits potential opportunities for ethnic minorities (see Section
 3).
 Women.-Although the Constitution and laws provide for equal rights for women,
 they are largely confined by custom to traditional roles, especially in agriculture. Po-
 lygyny, whicn is widespread among the Fang, contributes to women's secondary sta-
 tus, as does limited education opportunity; women receive only one-fifth as much
 schooling as men receive.
 Violence against women, particularly wife beating, is common. Medical profes-
 sionals estimate that 30 to 35 percent of women experience violence in the home.
 The Government does not maintain records of such incidents, nor does it prosecute
 them.
 There is no discrimination against women with regard to inheritance and family
 laws. For an estimated 90 percent of the women in the country-i.e., virtually all
 ethnic groups except the Bubi-tradition dictates that if a marriage is dissolved, the
 woman must return the dowry given her family by the bridegroom at the time of
 marriage, and the husband automatically receives custody of all children from the
 union. Similarly in the Fang, Ndowe, and Bisio cultures, primogeniture is practiced
 and as women bcome members of their husband's families upon marriage, they
 usually are not accorded inheritance rights. In theory, women may buy and sell
 property as well as goods, but in practice the male-dominated society permits few
 women access to sufficient funds to engage in more than petty trading or to pur-
 chase real proerty beyond a garden plot or modest home.
 Children.-The Government devotes little attention to children's rights or welfare
 and has no set policy in this area.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-There is no legal discrimination against eth-
 nic or racial minorities per se, but in practice some members of minorities face dis-
 crimination because they do not come from the Fang clan, or belong to a subelan
 other than the President's. Minorities do not face discrimination in inheritance,
 marriage, or family laws.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no constitutional or legal provision for the
 physically disabled with respect to discrimination in emploent or education.
 There is no legislation mandating accessibility for the disabled to buildings or gov-
 ernment services.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Although the Constitution provides for the right to
 organize unions, the Government has not passed enabling legislation. In the small
 wage-economy, no labor organizations exist, although there are a few cooperatives
 with limited power. The law prohibits strikes. There is a Labor Code which purports
 to uphold the dignity of the worker, but the Government generally does not enforce
 it.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no legislation regard-
 ing these rights or addressing antiunion discrimination, and no evidence of collective
 bargaining by any group. Wages are set by the Government and the employers, with
 little or no input by workers. Employers must meet the minimum wages set by the
 Government, and most companies pay above the government-established minimum.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law forbids forced labor and
 slavery, and there is no evidence that such activity takes place. Convicted felons do,
 within the law, perform extensive labor outside prison without compensation.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for child
 employment is 16 years, but the Ministry of Labor does not enforce this law. The
 Government also does not enforce the law, which stipulates mandatory education up
 to the age of 18. Underage youth perform both family farm work and urban commer-
 cial vending.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law prescribes a standard 40-hour work-
 week and a 48-hour rest period; these are observed. The minimum monthly wage
 is approximately $46 (CFA 27,500). The Labor Code provides comprehensive protec-
 tions for workers from occupational hazards, but the Government does not enforce
 
 
 74
 these in practice. Employees who protest unhealthy or dangerous working conditions
 risk loss of their jobs.
