 LIBYA*
 The Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya describes its
 form of government as "popular democracy." Although in theory
 political power is vested in "the masses" under the guidance
 of the People's Congress and its executive arms, the People's
 Committees, in practice the country is ruled by a charismatic
 military leader, Colonel Mu'ammar Al-Qadhafi, aided by
 extragovernmental "Revolutionary Committees." The governing
 principles of the society are expressed in Qadhafi's "Green
 Book" rather than in the Constitution. Qadhafi has created a
 political system that borrows from pan-Islamic and pan-Arab
 sources, purporting to establish a "third way" superior to
 both capitalism and socialism. Despite the local level
 participants in government, Qadhafi, though holding no formal
 government position, is the primary decisionmaker on all
 important issues.
 Libya's security apparatus operates at various levels,
 involving not only Qadhafi's personal bodyguards and the
 official country-wide police/interior establishment, but also
 the Revolutionary Committees and Basic People's Committees
 which act independently of other authorities when encouraged
 by Qadhafi. The result is a complex of multilayered tight
 controls, not necessarily explicitly dictated, over individual
 activities and freedoms. The conservative attitudes of a
 strict Islamic society produce further restrictions on the
 individual freedoms and rights of certain groups, e.g.
 businesspersons. Qadhafi has sought to provide greater
 equality for women in education and employment but has faced
 serious resistance from his conservative countrymen.
 Libya has used much of its considerable oil income of recent
 years to finance internal development (new schools, hospitals,
 roads) and generally to increase the standard of living of the
 people. Qadhafi has, however, diverted substantial resources
 to the acquisition of large quantities of weapons and to
 foreign military adventures, e.g., intervention in Uganda and
 two invasions of Chad. Further, the recent decline in oil
 revenues has forced retrenchment: significant parts of Libya's
 1981-85 development plan have been dropped, foreign exchange
 controls have been tightened, and imports have been
 restricted. Most recently, Qadhafi's move to expel thousands
 of foreign workers has in some cases hit directly at key
 public services, e.g., bread lines have resulted from the
 departure of Tunisian bakers.
 Libya's human rights record, poor since Qadhafi seized power
 in 1969, showed little improvement in 1985. Although there
 was no incident comparable to the 1984 coup attempt, with its
 subsequent brutal and widespread purge, there were continued
 reports of torture and abuse. Qadhafi has urged a reduction
 in the number of offenses subject to capital punishment, but
 he not only made it clear that such sentences would continue
 to apply to political acts against the regime but also
 reiterated his call for the searching out and execution of the
 regime's "enemies abroad." Treatment of foreigners worsened,
 as reflected not only in the summary expulsion of some 65,000
 foreign workers but also in the illegal detention of
 foreigners, including 4 British citizens detained for some 10

 months as hostages in an effort to blackmail the British
 Government.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Although there was no repeat of the widespread summary
 executions and public hangings (carried on television) which
 followed the coup attempt of May 1984, 1985 saw at least four
 possible coup attempts with subsequent arrests and punishments
 for those accused. In early 1984, the Government directed
 resumption of assassinations of Libyan exiles and announced
 the formation of "suicide squads" to hunt down and kill Libyan
 dissidents abroad. In September 1985, Qadhafi explicitly
 stated that the death penalty was still appropriate for
 individuals who refused to repent and reiterated his call that
 they be searched out and killed. A year after the attempted
 assassination of former Libyan Prime Minister Abdel Hamid
 Al-Bakoush in November 1984 in Cairo, confirmed by Libya's
 official news agency as the act of Libyan "commandos" whose
 job was to eliminate "stray dogs abroad," Egyptian authorities
 in November 1985 announced the arrest of another four-man
 Libyan "hit team" which had again targeted Bakoush and other
 Libyan dissidents in Egypt. The Egyptians stated that their
 investigation revealed that this was but one of seven such
 Libyan teams being trained for such missions.
 b. Disappearance
 Unofficial elements such as the Revolutionary and Basic
 Peoples Committees continue to carry out arrest and detention
 of suspected opponents of the Government, with the
 encouragement of Qadhafi. Such persons, as well as those
 detained by the official security establishment, may be held
 incommunicado for unlimited periods without further
 information as to their condition, whereabouts, or the charges
 against them. This has been particularly the case for many
 rounded up in the wake of the May 1984 coup attempt.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Continuing reports of torture and mistreatment of prisoners
 received graphic confirmation in the televised "trials"
 following the May 1984 coup, in which some of the accused
 clearly showed evidence of abuse. Detainees in criminal and
 security cases reportedly are regularly beaten during
 interrogation. In some prisons, conditions reportedly are
 tolerable but, according to information received by Amnesty
 International, conditions of detention for political prisoners
 have worsened, including transfer to overcrowded cells and
 confiscation of reading and writing materials.
 Mistreatment is not limited to Libyan nationals. In a case
 described by Amnesty International in its 1985 report, a
 Norwegian sailor reportedly died under torture in the custody
 of a Revolutionary Committee in May 1984. The Libyan
 authorities sought to attribute the death to suicide and the
 ship's authorities, before the ship was allowed to depart,
 were forced to apologize for this "suicide"--a violation of
 
 
 1310
 LIBYA
 Islamic law. At the U.N. General Assembly in September 1985,
 the Libyan Foreign Minister reportedly agreed to pay $500,000
 in damages to the survivors to settle the case. There are
 numerous reports that foreign workers, summarily expelled from
 Libya in August and September 1985, were harassed and beaten
 in the course of their efforts to leave the country.
 While Shari'a (Islamic) law is practiced in Libya, there are
 no reports that physical mutilation is used as a form of
 punishment. Amnesty International has expressed concern about
 the large number of offenses, including political offenses,
 which are punishable by death under Libyan law. For example,
 membership in an illegal organization is a capital offense.
 Qadhafi, in a September speech to the Peoples' Congresses,
 called for a review of the application of capital punishment,
 terming it "cruel" and not respectful of human dignity.
 However, he reaffirmed application of the death penalty to
 those already under detention or who plot against the
 revolution.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Libyan law, detainees may be held incommunicado for
 unlimited periods. Many allegedly are held without charge or
 trial, apparently as an example to would-be opponents of the
 regime. Libya declared several years ago that there were then
 "no political detainees on any charge in its prisons."
 Reports from a variety of sources, however, assert that the
 prisons contain increased numbers of persons convicted of, or
 held for, political offenses, including large numbers of
 persons arrested in 1984. Qadhafi has justified imprisonment
 on political, as opposed to criminal, charges. In a 1981
 speech he stated, "Those who are put into prisons are there
 because they are the enemies of the people. There is no shame
 and there is nothing wrong in putting these persons in prison
 or in treading on them with your feet." In March 1985, in
 addressing the People's Congress, Qadhafi again encouraged
 Revolutionary Committees to investigate and arrest persons
 guilty of treason whose cases, for whatever reason, the police
 could not handle. Although he also opposed secret arrests,
 there is no evidence that this exhortation has resulted in any
 improvement in practice. Foreigners are not immune from
 arbitary arrest. Four British citizens were arrested in 1984
 and held for 10 months in apparent retaliation for the U.K.'s
 arrest of Libyans responsible for bombings and assassinations
 in the U.K. While Qadhafi disclaimed personal responsibility,
 stating that these arrests resulted from the action of "the
 people," he did acknowledge that the issue was "basically
 political." The four were eventually released following
 negotiations conducted on their behalf by Terry Waite, an aide
 to the Archbishop of Canterbury.
 Exile is not a form of punishment practiced in Libya; to the
 contrary, Qadhafi seeks to exercise pressure on Libyans
 working or studying abroad to return to Libya. Libya does,
 however, engage in the arbitrary expulsion of noncitizens. In
 August 1985, it summarily expelled thousands of foreign
 workers, including more than 30,000 Tunisians and 10,000
 Egyptians. They were expelled generally without the right to
 take more than minimal possessions, often without complete
 compensation for work performed or the right to transfer
 savings held in Libya, and in many cases were subject to
 harassment in the process of departure and had their travel
 documents confiscated. The International Labor Organization
 
 
 1311
 LIBYA
 sent a team to Libya to investigate these actions, and a
 report is pending. (Two of the confiscated passports were
 later found in the possession of Palestinian terrorists in an
 attack at the Vienna airport in December.)  In general,
 forced labor is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The normal court structure in Libya has been bypassed to a
 significant extent by the "people's courts," which conduct
 "show trials" and executions. This parallel legal system
 provides fewer safeguards, and trials are frequently held in
 camera or in absentia. A 1981 law prohibits the private
 practice of law and makes all attorneys employees of the
 Secretariat of Justice. The Union of Arab Lawyers, located in
 France, has expressed concern for the ability and freedom of
 attorneys simultaneously to provide legal defense for
 political prisoners and to serve as government employees.
 Libya claims that it "guarantees prisoners all necessary means
 of defense and safeguards of justice adequate to the
 principles contained in the Declaration of Human Rights" and
 provides for legal assistance "as soon as possible with
 respect to the exigencies of interrogation," but there are
 numerous reports that these rights are frequently denied. In
 security cases in particular, there are many reports of
 prisoners being held without trial for long periods. While
 undergoing interrogation, sometimes for periods of several
 months, they are given no access to legal representation.
 Alleged political offenses are increasingly tried before ad
 hoc "revolutionary courts" rather than under the normal
 judicial procedure, with the opportunities for defense
 severely restricted. Moreover a number of these "trials" have
 been held in secret. There is no precise estimate of the
 number of political prisoners in Libya. In the wake of the
 1984 coup attempt, the number may have risen to several
 thousand.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government recognizes no absolute right to privacy. The
 legal requirement that judicial warrants must be obtained
 before entering a private home is reportedly often
 disregarded. Local and international phone calls are
 routinely monitored. The informer network extends to the
 Revolutionary Committees and other local organizations and
 does not respect individual privacy. Libyan exiles claim that
 mere family ties to suspected regime opponents can result in
 harassment or even persecution by the authorities.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although some difference of opinion is tolerated in People's
 Committee meetings and at the General People's Congress, in
 general freedom of speech is severely limited, particularly
 with regard to any criticism of the Government or Qadhafi.
 Freedom of speech and other basic civil and political freedoms
 are further restricted during periods of internal security
 crises. Libyan media are owned and controlled by the
 Government. JANA, the official news agency, is the designated
 conduit for politically acceptable opinions. It is impossible
 to publish opinions contrary to government policy, Foreikn
 
 
 1312
 LIBYA
 publications, if not banned outright, are severely censored.
 There is an underlying climate of fear and mistrust at all
 levels of society which further restricts freedom of speech.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of association is granted only to those institutions
 affiliated with the regime. Public assembly is repressed if
 it is not government-controlled and supportive of regime
 positions. Organizations such as trade unions and
 professional associations are viewed as threats by Qadhafi,
 who has vowed not to "accept intermediaries between the
 revolution and its working forces."
 Unions are organized under government control and are
 administered through the popular committee system. Collective
 bargaining does not occur; there have been no reports of
 strikes (except by students) for years--presumably they are
 not permitted. An exiled opposition group in June 1983
 appealed to the International Labor Organization to
 investigate "the oppressive record of the Qadhafi regime with
 regard to its treatment of workers and laborers and employees
 in Libya, with particular emphasis on violations of human
 rights agreements and conventions governing labor and labor
 unions." This group also charged that Libya has forced
 foreign workers and employees into military training with the
 intention of coercing them into military and subversive
 activities against their own countries.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Libya is overwhelmingly Muslim. The regime has banned the
 once-powerful Sanusiyya Islamic religious organization in an
 apparent effort to eliminate any alternative power bases.
 Restrictions were placed on the operation of the
 organization's Zawaayaa (lodges), a government supervisor was
 appointed for Sanusi properties, and the Sanusi-sponsored
 Islamic University was merged with the University of Libya.
 Services are apparently permitted in Christian churches, which
 are exclusively attended by the foreign community. There is a
 resident Catholic bishop and a small number of priests. Nuns
 reportedly are permitted to wear their habits.
 Nearly all of the formerly sizable Jewish community has
 emigrated, and no information is available on the status of
 any Jews who may remain. Qadhafi has stated that he is
 opposed to Zionism, not Judaism, and that Arab nations should
 welcome Arab Jews who wish to return to their countries of
 origin. But in a speech in June 1985 he cited the Prophet
 Muhammed as stating that Judaism and Islam cannot coexist in
 the land of the Arabs and, in September 1985, virulently
 anti-Jewish broadcasts on Libyan radio called for anti-Jewish
 violence in areas of Tunisia within broadcast range.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 With the exception of security areas, internal freedom of
 movement is not usually restricted for Libyan citizens. An
 exit permit is required for travel abroad, and currency
 controls are imposed to restrict travel. Military
 conscription regrulations deny the issuance of exit permits to
 potential inductees. It is reported to be increasingly
 
 
 1313
 LIBYA
 difficult for Libyans suspected of inadequate revolutionary
 attitudes to travel abroad. Moreover, as part of the effort
 to control the outflow of foreign exchange, there are
 indications that the Government is limiting nonessential
 travel, such as tourism in Europe. Restrictions'already limit
 the amount of currency which can be taken out of the country
 to $1,000 (300 dinars) per year, regardless of the number of
 trips. Under Libyan Islamic law, wives may not leave the
 countty without their husbands' permission; children may not
 travel without their father's consent. The right of return of
 Libyan nationals is fully protected, and theoretically extends
 to include opponents of Qadhafi, so long as they are prepared
 to "repent." However, this "right" often appears to be more
 of an obligation or threat, with calls for students and others
 working abroad, often under government subsidy, to return with
 little or no notice and without regard to the impact on their
 studies or work.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Major government decisions are controlled by Qadhafi or by
 committees acting in his name. He makes all appointments of
 military officers and official functionaries down to a low
 level. Power flows through a small circle of trusted
 associates, whose own authority is a reflection of their
 proximity to Qadhafi. Corruption has assumed major
 proportions, with adverse effects for local government.
 Participation in elections is mandatory, and the candidates
 are cleared by the Revolutionary Committees from among persons
 who are not "merchants, contractors, tribal advocates,
 elections-brokers, officials of the former (pre-1969)
 government or people who have been attacked by the power of
 the revolution." Political parties and tribal or local
 groupings are prohibited, and involvement in such activities
 remains punishable by death.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 In its 1985 report, Amnesty International expressed concern
 over renewed official calls for "physical liquidation of
 enemies of the revolution" and subsequent killings of Libyans
 at home and abroad; the continued detention and imprisonment
 of prisoners of conscience; the detention without trial of
 political prisoners; trials before People's Congresses without
 basic legal safeguards and resulting in executions; the
 systematic torture and ill-treatment of political and other
 suspects during the course of interrogations; and the death
 penalty. In its 1984 report on Violations of Human Rights in
 Libya, Amnesty International noted that it has registered
 repeated protests, calls for investigations, and appeals for
 the respect of human rights with the Libyan authorities, all
 without reply or signs of corrective action. Freedom House
 classifies Libya as "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Libya's population of 3,752,000 is growing at the rate of 3.2
 percent annually. Per capita gross domestic product rose from
 $5,560 in 1971 to $11,700 in 1980 before slipping to about
 $8,000 last year.
 
 
 1314
 LIBYA
 Libya's substantial oil wealth has allowed the regime to
 improve living standards significantly, especially for the
 lower classes, despite major expenditures for military
 equipment. Oil revenues have provided the basis for the
 expansion of infrastructure providing services to the
 population such as schools and health facilities; they also
 fund the recruitment of foreigners to man these facilities,
 where Libyan human resources are inadequate.
 Libya has generally abided by the reduction in its OPEC quota
 to 990,000 barrels per day and as a result has witnessed a
 sharp drop in its revenues. Budget expenditures in the past 3
 years have been scaled back and the imposition of foreign
 exchange controls has sharply reduced imports of consumer
 goods, resulting in chronic shortages. Recent indications are
 that the supply of basic food supplies essential for balanced
 nutrition, particularly outside major urban areas, has been
 affected, with resulting impact on health standards.
 Similarly, the large-scale expulsion of foreign workers in
 August, in part a reflection of the need for greater economic
 austerity, has had an immediate impact on the quality of life
 and availability of services for many Libyans.
 Investment in health facilities and marked growth in female
 literacy over the past decade have contributed to an increase
 in life expectancy at birth from 52 years in 1971 to 58 in
 1984. The infant mortality rate is approximately 82 per 1,000
 live births. Virtually all of the population has access to
 safe drinking water. Salt water encroachment into littoral
 aquifers is contaminating fresh water supplies in some urban
 areas, forcing the Government to undertake massive water
 projects.
 No information is available on Libyan regulations governing
 workers' rights. In general, there is no evidence that child
 labor is a problem in Libya. Foreign workers are subject to
 arbitrary pressures such as changes in work rules and
 contracts with little option but to accept or depart, often
 without full compensation for work already performed.
 However, with the Government dependent in many cases on the
 skills of these expatriates, most foreign laborers are paid
 substantially more than would be possible in their home
 countries.
 The traditional, conservative cultural attitudes of Libya's
 Islamic society serve to restrict the rights of certain
 groups, most notably women. Within the confines of Islamic
 beliefs, Qadhafi has taken a leadership role in efforts to
 change the status of women and expand their access to
 educational and employment opportunities. Although his
 proposal that women along with men be subject to military
 conscription was orginally defeated, Qadhafi succeeded in
 having the decision reversed and women currently receive basic
 military training and are subject to a draft.
