 IRAQ*
 Since gaining its independence in 1932, Iraq has passed
 through several periods of instability and violence. The
 current government, under control of the Arab Baath Socialist
 Party, came to power by coup in 1968.
 The wealth generated by Iraq's oil reserves is being invested
 to a large degree in health and education services, housing,
 transportation, and non-petroleum sectors of the economy.
 A substantial portion goes to the military establishment.
 Although the Provisional constitution guarantees individual
 rights, in practice they are subordinated to the interests
 of the state and society. Political rights are sharply
 limited and little dissent is tolerated. The media are
 censored and there are few dependable sources of informa-
 tion about many government practices. Activities which the
 state considers to be threats to its security can lead to
 detention without chargeb, severe prison sentences, mistreat-
 ment, torture, and execution. The government does not
 facilitate outside investigation of alleged human rights
 violations in Iraq.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 It appears that almost all persons arrested for political
 reasons are tortured. In its 1980 Annual Report, Amnesty
 International expressed concern about what it describes as
 the 'routine and systematic torture of political detainees."
 Although Article 22(A) of the constitution prohibits
 torture, allegations persist that both severe physical and
 psychological torture are used during interrogations.
 Beatings with rubber hoses or planks, suspension from a
 ceiling fan, and electric shock treatment have been reported.
 Psychological maltreatment is said to include threatening
 prisoners with loaded weapons, playing tape recordings of
 torture sessions, and threatening members of a prisoner's
 family in his presence.
 Some persons reportedly have died under torture. No evidence
 has been received that the regime disciplines personnel who
 employ torture.
 *Iraq broke diplomatic relations with the United States
 during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. Although the United
 States maintains an Interests Section in Baghdad, contact
 with the Iraqi government and direct access to information
 is limited.
 This report deals with the Human Rights situation in Iraq
 prior to the outbreak of hostilities with Iran in September
 1980. Little is known about the impact on human rights in
 Iraq since then.

 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Degrading treatment allegedly is practiced following arrest
 and during interrogation, especially where security matters
 are involved. Reportedly, such treatment is discontinued
 after completion of an investigation or sentencing.
 Prison conditions for convicted criminals are better than
 those for detainees; they can have food provided from the
 outside, and have access to some medical services.  Temporary
 detention facilities reportedly are crowded and unsanitary.
 Security suspects are not allowed to see either relatives or
 attorneys until after their interrogation is finished.
 Security suspects past the interrogation stage, or persons
 charged with common felonies, usually can receive visitors,
 including attorneys. Prisoners are jailed in groups according
 to length of sentence. Amnesty International (AI) reported
 that one hundred political prisoners were executed in March
 and April of 1980. In September 1980, AI alleged that
 various persons may have been given slow-acting poison while
 in custody. Two such released prisoners died some weeks
 after their release.
 c. Disappearances
 The regime carries out secret arrests and detentions and
 justifies these practices on grounds of internal security.
 One incident which gained wide international attention
 during the past year involved the disappearance and presumed
 execution, .in April 1980, of Iraq's leading Shi'ite clergyman,
 the Ayatollah Baqr Sadr. Also, foreign press accounts
 alleged that two prominent scientists associated with the
 Thuwaitha Nuclear Research Center were arrested secretly in
 late 1979 or early 1980. Their fate is unknown. Iraq's
 representative to the United Nations Human Rights Commission's
 Committee on Disappeared Persons himself disappeared after
 his return to Baghdad in the spring of 1980.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Citizens in Iraq are subject to arbitrary arrest.  Felony
 suspects are protected by writ of habeas corpus; political
 detainees are not. For neither type of detainee is there a
 time limit for which he or she can be detained.without
 trial. Information concerning the number of political
 detainees is inconclusive.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials in civil, criminal, and religious courts are open.
 Defendants in these courts are entitled to counsel; a
 lawyer is provided if a defendant cannot afford one.
 Charges and evidence are available for review. There is
 a system of appellate courts for cases which do not come
 under the jurisdiction of the revolutionary courts.
 Closed trials are the rule in the revolutionary courts,
 which hear such crimes as espionage, treason, smuggling,
 and drug trafficking. Closed, too, are the *special
 
 
 987
 courts" constituted by the Revolutionary Command Council
 for specific incidents, such as the reported conspiracy
 against the regime in 1979. Lawyers assigned to defendants
 in revolutionary court cases are court employees. Defendants
 in these courts may not necessarily be informed of the
 charges against them prior to trial. Little informa-
 tion is available about judicial process in these cases,
 since they nearly always are closed. Decisions of revolutio-
 nary courts and special courts can be reversed by appeal to
 the Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council, President
 Saddam Hussein.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The provision in the provisional Constitution of July 16,
 1970, protecting inviolability of the home is rpinforced by
 strong cultural values. The law requires police to obtain a
 search warrant before entering the home of a felony suspect.
 The law fails to extend similar protection to security
 suspects. Arrests usually occur outside the home and
 allegations of illegal entry are rare. Wiretapping occurs.
 2. Government    Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Iraq has a socialist centrally controlled economy. Although
 its oil revenues have pushed up per capita GDP from $1900
 in 1978 to nearly $2800 in 1979, most of this increase
 represents a pro rata share of accumulated foreign reserve
 resulting from higher oil prices. The government has
 earmarked these funds for development projects rather than
 to increase consumer purchasing power. Wages slightly lead
 the 15-17 percent inflation rate.
 Although a large portion of national income is spent on
 defense, between 1978 and 1979 the human resources allocation
 of the budget grew at a faster rate than that of defense: 58
 percent vs. 26 percent.
 The government uses its earnings to guarantee a minimum
 income and to raise living standards of certain groups
 outside the labor force. This is reflected, for example,
 in the Social Welfare Law of 1980, which included provisions
 for subsidizing the income of the elderly, children of divorced
 parents, and handicapped persons. The minimum wage for
 unskilled laborers has increased from about $35 per month in
 1968 to about $190 in 1980. Because of the labor shortage
 and the booming economy, laborers normally command consider-
 ably more than the minimum. For the same reasons, unemploy-
 ment is virtually non-existent, although underemployment is
 still common, especially in rural areas.
 Health care either is free or provided at a token fee.
 Although serious shortages of qualified personnel persist,
 medical professionals and workers increased from 9,000 in
 
 
 *988
 1968 to over 40,000 in 1980. The number of medical and
 nursing training institutes increased in the same period
 from three to sixty-five. Citizens who cannot be treated in
 Iraq are eligible for government grants or exemptions from
 currency exchange laws in order to pay for treatment abroad.
 There was one doctor per 2,000 persons in 1980. Recent
 medical school graduates are required to serve for three
 years in rural clinics. The government also uses such
 benefits as bonuses and free housing to encourage health
 professionals to work outside of the cities.
 Education is free through the university level and the
 government offers a wide range of scholarships for advanced
 study abroad. In the last ten years, the number of primary
 and secondary schools has more than doubled. There also has
 been a dramatic increase in the number of students in
 vocational schools and universities. The government claims
 that in the course of implementing the Anti-Illiteracy Law
 of 1976, it has raised Iraq's literacy rate to 70 percent.
 Substantial progress in basic education has been made and is
 continuing as the government strives to expand and upgrade
 the skills of its labor force.
 Iraq's socialist economy is centrally controlled and major
 industries, including petroleum, are state-owned. However,
 a small, thriving private sector exists and there are signs
 that its role will grow as the government develops non-oil
 related industries. While this trend is due more to dis-
 appointment with state-managed enterprises than to a shift
 in philosophy, it has encouraged entrepeneurs.
 In rural areas the land reform program has succeeded in
 ending the feudal system of the past but has not yet
 replaced it with a viable system. Government officials
 recently expressed disillusionment with collective and
 state farms; some assets have been spun off to indivi-
 duals. Substantial funds for agricultural loans to
 single family units have been authorized and the
 government is experimenting with farmer-owned corporations
 to exploit newly reclaimed land.
 The middle class and increasingly affluent workers have
 pressured the government to increase the supply of consumer
 goods. Availability of these items has been hindered by
 severe import restrictions and poor distribution. The
 government has sought to avert the spiraling prices ex-
 perienced elsewhere by opening large distribution outlets
 which sell basic imported goods at moderate prices.
 Heavy migration to the cities has resulted in sub-standard
 living conditions there. Numerous public housing projects
 are under construction. An extensive system of subsidies
 and controls keeps the prices for food staples, utilities
 and transportation low.
 The government has moved to improve the status of women in
 Iraq and to enhance their participation in the workforce,
 
 
 989
 both in terms of numbers and level of skill. Women are
 guaranteed by law equal employment and educational opportunity,
 equal pay, equal rights to property, and business ownership.
 Increasing numbers of women are joining the workforce in a
 wide range of occupations. In 1980 the Air Force College
 admitted its first group of female pilot trainees. A
 personal status law of February, 1978 permits women to
 institute divorce proceedings and outlaws coerced marriages.
 Many women still adhere to traditional norms due to social,
 cultural, and religious pressures. However, the government
 is providing the legal framework and the opportunities to
 allow them to improve their status.
 Some corruption occurs, but is risky in Iraq where the
 penalty could be -- and at times, has been -- execution.
 There is no indication that existing corruption inter-
 feres with vital needs or.denies important resources
 to the average citizen or to.the poor.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Libertie- Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The government views any form of political dissent as
 a threat to the security of the country, and tightly controls
 the exercise of the rights of speech, press, and assembly.
 The constitution prohibits *any act aimed at undermining
 the national unity of the people, provoking racial, sec-
 tarian, or regional bigotry; or violating gains and achieve-
 ments of the country..
 The media are government controlled and often government
 owned. The press, radio, and television receive daily
 guidance from the government; they are not permitted to
 criticize the government or its policies. Media which
 fail to follow guidance are suspended, as was the Iraqi
 Communist Party paper in April, 1979. Foreign periodi-
 cals, books, and movies are screened and censored before
 distribution.
 Iraq is an ethnically and religiously diverse society.
 The government pursues a policy aimed at assimilating
 its various ethnic and religious groups, including the
 Jewish, Kurdish, Yezidi, and Christian minorities. In
 some instances, this takes the form of trying to wean
 groups away from their cultural traditions, languages,
 ethnic identity, and way of life, although the govern-
 ment has recently tempered its policies in this regard.
 The size of the Jewish community in Iraq is believed to
 number fewer than 300, composed mainly of older people.
 The extent of the community's religious activity is not
 known. Although the last of some 200 Freemasons imprisoned
 in 1973-74 were amnestied in July, 1979, some members of the
 Bahai sect are still imprisoned. Organized activities
 by Freemasons and Bahais are prohlb-ited.
 
 
 990
 Iraq's Christians constitute about five percent of the popu-
 lation. Although Iraq is constitutionally an Islamic state,
 the government advocates a secular policy. Christians
 enjoy freedom of worship in churches of established Christian
 sects, which receive some support from the state, but not
 freedom to proselytize or hold meetings outside of church
 premises. Convents and monasteries exist and some new
 church construction has been undertaken. In early 1980, the
 government instituted obligatory Koranic studies for all
 students, including non-Muslims. It was withdrawn after it
 met with vigorous opposition from the Christian community
 and from visiting Arab-American groups.
 While the Shi'a Muslims make up a 55 percent majority of
 the population, they are economically and socially disadvan-
 taged by the governing Sunnis. As a result of Iranian-
 inspired terrorist attacks on senior government and Baath
 Party officials, members of the Shi'a community were the
 target of a major campaign of arrests, executions and
 expulsions in 1980. The government allows such Shi'a
 religious practices as public flagellation and mass gatherings,
 which it had prohibited prior to an outbreak of severe Shi'a
 disturbances in 1977.
 The Baath Party uses several mass organizations to assist
 in maintaining its control over the country. Voluntary
 associations and trade unions are not free. All public
 meetings" must be approved by the government. While labor
 unions have the right to strike, they do so only with
 official acquiescence.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 In Iraq, security areas are off limits, including parts
 of central Baghdad and sensitive border areas. There are
 police checkpoints along all highways and outside every
 major town, but most Iraqis and foreigners travel freely in
 non-restricted areas. Foreign diplomats must obtain permits
 from the Foreign Ministry for travel to areas outside of
 Baghdad. Iraqi passport fees are reasonable. All Iraqis
 and most foreigners are required to obtain exit permission.
 Citizens usually are limited to one trip per year outside
 the Arab world. Men of draft age and those who have
 records of political activity may find it difficult to
 obtain travel documents; many wait years to receive exit
 visas. Students and teachers may leave the country only
 during school vacation periods. A married woman must
 have the permission of her husband to travel abroad.
 There are indirect restrictions on emigration; Iraq
 discourages professional and skilled workers from
 emigrating. It restricts the transfer of assets and
 
 
 991
 currency out of the country, and penalties for violating
 exchange laws are severe.
 Iraq rarely practices banishment or exile. However,
 over 30,000 Iranians and Iraqis of Iranian descent were
 summarily expelled to Iran in April 1980. In recent
 years, the government instituted special programs to
 encourage qualified professionals to come back to the
 country.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There are three legal parties: the ruling Ba'ath Party and
 two Kurdish parties. Together, they constitute the Patriotic
 and Progressive National Front (PPNF) -- essentially a
 vehicle of support for the government. The two non-Balath
 parties carry on only limited activity. Members of the
 Iraqi military or security services may engage in political
 activities only within the Ba'ath Party. Membership in the
 party is not required for appointment to senior government
 positions but is necessary for political success. Opposi-
 tion groups are not tolerated and are severely repressed.
 The outlawed Da'wa Party bore the brunt of the regime's
 persecution of rival political groups in 1980; membership
 or association in the group, which has engaged in anti-regime
 terrorism, bears the penalty of execution. The Communist
 Party was removed from the PPNF and declared illegal in
 1979.
 Elections for a National Assembly were held in June 1980,
 the first general elections since the overthrow of the
 monarchy in 1958. Although voters were free to choose
 from among many candidates, all candidates were carefully
 screened by the government before the campaign. Voter
 turnout among women as well as men was heavy and sixteen
 women were elected to the Assembly. It is assumed that the
 Assembly will have no real political power, although it
 represents a first step toward popular participation in
 government. Government officials such as mayors, governors
 and ministers are appointed by the central government.
 Iraq seeks the full integration of minorities and foreign
 residents. In early 1980, for example, the Revolutionary
 Command Council issued decrees compelling long-term foreign
 residents either to be naturalized as Iraqis or to leave the
 country. However, these decrees have not yet been carried out.
 4. Government Attitudes and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of luman Rights
 Iraq has not permitted outside investigations of alleged
 human rights violations and has had virtually no contact
 with foreign non-governmental human rights organizations.
 No human rights monitoring groups are known to exist within
 thc country.
 
 
 992
 Iraq is a member of the U.N. Commision on Human Rights.
 It has participated in international conferences on human
 rights matters, and Baghdad has hosted various human rights
 conferences.
