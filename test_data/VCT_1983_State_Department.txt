 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 
 St. Vincent and the Grenadines retains the multi-party
 parliamentary system of government which it inherited when it
 became independent from the United Kingdom in 1979. Democratic
 traditions and respect for the rights of the individual have
 continued since then. The ruling St. Vincent Labor Party of
 Prime Minister Milton Cato still has significant support and
 has been greatly aided by the lack of cohesion in the
 opposition.
 St. Vincent is a poor country with a very young population,
 half of which is under 15 years of age. Unemployment,
 especially among the young, is a serious problem. The economy
 of St. Vincent remained sluggish in 1983 mainly because of the
 world-wide recession and exchange rate reductions which
 affected the vital banana industry.
 The police are the only security force in the country. The
 force maintains British traditions of professionalism which
 place a high value on respect for human rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 The only significant allegation of the violation of human
 rights in St. Vincent concerns Alfonso Shallow, who died on
 July 4, 1983, while in police custody. Opposition groups have
 alleged that the police killed Shallow; the police say that he
 died of self-inflicted injuries sustained before he was taken
 into custody. This case was the subject of a coroner's
 inquest, which absolved the police. There have been no other
 reports of unlawful or arbitrary deprivation of life by the
 Vincentian authorities.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances in 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no reports of torture or cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading treatment or punishment in 1983.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides for legal representation of the
 detained and for periodic review of their cases. The
 Vincentian Government assiduously follows these provisions.
 There are no political prisoners, and there were no reports of
 arbitrary arrests, other forms of detention or summary exile in
 1983.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 St. Vincent provides for public trials before an independent
 and impartial court. There is a presumption of innocence.
 Defendants are allowed legal counsel. Appeals can be made
 ultimately to the British Privy Council.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There have been no reports of the arbitrary intrusion of the
 state into the private life of the individual. The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry and search, and this
 prohibition is honored by the authorities.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and of the press,
 and the Government respects these rights. There is no
 censorship or interference in the operation of newspapers,
 which may openly and freely criticize the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The freedom to assemble peaceably is respected in practice.
 Public meetings and demonstrations opposing the Government were
 allowed in 1983. The Government has adhered to the
 International Labor Organization's Convention on Freedom of
 Association. Unions enjoy the right of collective bargaining.
 They represent approximately 7,000 workers, or slightly more
 than 10 percent of the labor force.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 All religions are free to practice and proselytize in St.
 Vincent and the Grenadines.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 These rights are guaranteed in law and honored in practice.
 St. Vincent accepted numerous refugees from Grenada before and
 during the events of October 1983.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Rights of Citizens to
 Change their Government
 St. Vincent has a freely elected parliamentary system of
 government in which citizens have a genuine choice of parties,
 policies and officials. An open and contested parliamentary
 by-election was held in September 1983. Three parties fielded
 candidates; the candidate of the ruling party won a narrow
 victory. According to the Constitution, the next general
 election is due to take place no later than 1985.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no branches of international human rights
 organizations in St. Vincent. There is no local body which
 publicly monitors human rights violations, although opposition
 political groups occasionally comment on human rights
 practices. The Government is responsive to public and private
 inquiries on its human rights practices. Neither Amnesty
 International or Freedom House reported on St. Vincent and the
 Grenadines in 1983.

 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 St. Vincent and the Grenadines, with a population of 134,000,
 is a small, poor country with a rapidly growing population (3.2
 percent growth rate). Per capita GDP in 1981 was estimated at
 $660. The country relies heavily on its ailing agriculture
 sector. Bananas are the principal export crop; others include
 arrowroot, tropical fruits and edible roots. Recently tourism
 in St. Vincent has declined. St. Vincent's development has
 been hampered not only by the worldwide recession but also by
 the lack of an overall strategy to identify its potential.
 Growth of the economy also depends on the inflow of external
 public assistance.
 The Government emphasizes education in its development
 policies. It has a ten-year compulsory education system. The
 adult literacy rate is about 82 percent.
 The provision of health care is seriously hampered by a
 shortage of funds, facilities, and personnel. The improvement
 of physical facilities has occurred, but many trained personnel
 migrate each year because of low wages. St. Vincent has a
 rather high infant mortality rate of 54.8 per thousand live
 births. There is an ongoing family planning program which aims
 at containing the country's high population growth rate.
 The role of women in society is not restricted legally,
 although most women still center their lives around the home.
 Women are expected to take a greater part in other sectors of
 society in the future as they take greater advantage of public
 education programs, health facilities, and family planning.
