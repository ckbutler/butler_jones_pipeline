 FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA
 The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is composed of 607 small islands ex-
 tending over a large area of the central Pacific. Four states-Chuuk (formerly Truk),
 Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap--make up the federation. The population is estimated at
 106,000, mostly of Micronesian origin. The four states were part of the Trust Tern-
 
 
 853
 tory of the Pacific Islands and were administered by the United States from 1947
 to 1986 pursuant to an agreement with the United Nations.
 Political legitimacy rests on the popular will expressed by a majority vote through
 elections in accordance with the Constitution. There are three branches of govern-
 ment: An executive branch led by a president who also serves as head of state, a
 unicameral legislature elected from the four constituent states, and a judicial sys-
 tem that applies criminal and civil laws and procedures closely paralleling those of
 the United States.
 Under the Compact of Free Association, the United States is responsible for de-
 fense. The FSM has no security- forces of its own, aside from local police and other
 law enforcement officers, all of whom are firmly under the control of the civil au-
 thorities.
 The economy depends heavily on transfer payments from the United States, fish-
 ing, tourism, and subsistence agriculture.
 The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens. However, The
 Government's actions during the year called into question its support for freedom
 of the press. Traditional customs sustain a value system that distinguishes between
 people on the basis of social status and sex. There is evidence of some increase in
 both spousal abuse and child neglect. So far neither the Government nor other orga-
 nizations have successfully filled the role of the traditional extended family in pro-
 tecting and supporting its members.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There was no known incidence of torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards. There are no local orga-
 nizations concerning themselves solely with human rights, and the question of visits
 by human rights monitors has not arisen.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Legal procedures, for the most part pat-
 terned after U.S. law, provide for due process, which is carefully observed. There
 is no governmental use of exile for political purposes.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and it is independent in practice.
 The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is appointed by the President, with the
 advice and consent of the Congress.
 Public trial is provided for in the Bill of Rights, and trials are conducted fairly.
 Juveniles may have closed hearings. Despite these provisions, cultural resistance to
 litigation and incarceration as methods of maintaining public order have allowed
 some to act with impunity. Serious cases of sexual and other assault and even mur-
 der have not gone to trial, and suspects are routinely released indefinitely.
 There were no re     of  litical prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such arbitrary interference, and in practice there is none.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for these rights. A
 recent major test of their application, however, called into question the Govern-
 ment's concrete support for those rights, and whether they cover all-or only non-
 controversial and nonadversarial-speech and publishing. In recent years the FSM's
 only regular nongovernment printed news source has been the FSM News, edited
 and written by Canadian citizen Sherry O'Sullivan. The monthly was primarily
 noted for its reporting on alleged instances of government malfeasance. In March
 the Congress unanimously passed a resolution that O'Sullivan be declared an "unde-
 sirable alien;" she was later fired from her editorial position, and subsequently
 brought suit against her former business partners and several government rep-
 resentatives for libel. In accordance with the law, which requires departure when
 work contracts end, O'Sullivan left the country, but asked to return in order to con-
 tinue publishing with new backers. This permission was refused by the President,
 who cited her alleged violation of immigration regulations as the reason for the deci-
 sion. The Supreme Court later denied the application for even limited entry in con-
 nection with her pending lawsuit. The decisions of the Government to remove
 O'Sullivan and subsequently deny her reentry appeared directly linked to her pub-
 
 
 854
 liahing activities, and aimed at stiffing investigation and criticism of government ac-
 tivities and figures.
 Each of the four state governments controls a radio station broadcasting primarily
 in the local language. Local television programming in some states shows
 videotaped and occasionally live coverage of local sports and political and cultural
 events. Subscription cable television, showing major US. programming, is available
 in Chuuk and Pohnpei. Religious groups operate private radio stations. The national
 Government and the four states publish newsletters.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Bill of Rights provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and the Government respects these
 in practice. During political campaigns, citizens often question candidates at public
 meetings. Formal associations are uncommon in Micronesia, but student organiza-
 tions exist.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Bill of Rights forbids establishment of a state reli-
 gion and governmental restrictions on freedom of religion. The Government respects
 this freedom in practice; it is hospitable to diverse religions, and missionaries of
 many faiths work within the nation.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution has specific provisions for freedom of movement with-
 in the FSM. It is silent on foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation, but in prac-
 tice none of these is restricted.
 There have been no refugees or asylum seekers in the FSM, and the Government
 has not formulated a policy regarding refugees, asylees, or first asylum.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Congress is elected by popular vote from each state; the Congress then choos-
 es the President and Vice President from among its four at-large senators by major-
 ity vote. State governors, state legislators, and municipal governments are all elect-
 ed by direct popular vote. Political campaigning is unrestricted, and, as there are
 no established political parties, poitical support is generally courted from among
 family and allied clan groupings.
 Although there are no restnctions on the formation of political groups, there have
 been no significant efforts to form political parties.
 Cultural factors in the male-dominated society have limited women's representa-
 tion in government and politics. Although women are represented in mid-level posi-
 tions at both the federal and state level, there are no women in leadership roles at
 the highest government levels.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There were no known requests for investigations of alleged human rights viola-
 tions. While there are no official restrictions, there are no local groups exclusively
 concerned with human rights. There are, however, women's groups which concern
 themselves with rights for women and children.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Although the Constitution provides explicit protection against discrimination
 based on race, sex, language, or religion, there is extensive societal discrimination,
 notably discrimination and violence against women. Government enforcement of
 these constitutional protections is weak.
 Women.-Most violence against women occurs in the family context. In the tradi-
 tional Micronesian extended family unit, spouses and children were accorded strong
 protections from violence, abuse, and neglect. These were deemed offenses against
 the family, not just the individuals, and were dealt with by a complex system of fa-
 milial sanctions. With increasing urbanization and monetarization of the FSM econ-
 omy, however, more and more emphasis has been placed on the nuclear family, and
 the traditional methods of coping with family discord are breaking down. So far, no
 government agency, including the police, has been successful in replacing that ex-
 tended family system or in addressing the issue of familial violence directly.
 Incidents of both reported and unreported spousal abuse, often of increasing se-
 verity, continue to rise. Effective prosecution of such offenses is rare. In many cases
 the victim is pressured by family, or fears of further assault, or is convinced that
 the police will not actively involve themselves in what is seen as a private, family
 problem, and decides against pressing legal charges. There are no laws against do-
 mestic abuse, and no governmental or private facilities to shelter and support
 women in abusive situations.

 There are also a growing number of cases of physical and sexual assaults against
 women outside the family context. These assaults are perpetrated against both citi-
 zens and foreigners. Unmarried women are sometimes considered to have invited
 such violence by living, traveling, or socializing alone.
 Women have equal rights under the law, and there are no cultural or institutional
 barriers to education and employment. Women receive equal pay for equal work;
 they are well-represented in the lower and middle ranks of government, although
 there are no women at the highest levels of government. Women are active and in-
 creasingly successful in private business and enterprise. There has been a National
 Women's Advisory Council in existence since 1992, and there are several small non-
 governmental groups interested in women's issues, particularly ones associated with
 spousal and family violence and abuse.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's welfare through its pro-
 grams of health care and education, but these have not been adequate to meet the
 needs of the country's sharply growing population in an environment in which the
 extended family is breaking down.
 People With Disabilities.-Neither laws nor regulations mandate accessibility to
 public buildings and services for the disabled. Schools have established special edu-
 cation classes to address problems encountered by those who exhibit learning dis-
 abilities, although such classes are completely dependent on outside funding
 sources.
 National /Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The FSM prohibits non-Micronesians from
 purchasing land in the FSM, and the national Congress grants citizenship to non-
 Micronesians only by individual acts. For the most part, however, non-Micronesians
 share fully in the social and cultural life of the FSM.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Under the Bill of Rights, citizens have the right to
 form or join associations, and national government employees by law may form asso-
 ciations to "present their views' to the Government. However, as yet, neither asso-
 ciations nor trade unions have been formed in this largely nonindustrial society.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no law dealing spe-
 cifically with trade unions or with the right to collective bargaining. Wages are set
 by individual employers, the largest of which are the national and state govern-
 ments. The Government is not a member of the International Labor Organization.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits involuntary servitude, and there is no evidence of its practice. Children are
 not specifically cited in this prohibition, but forced and bonded labor by children is
 not known to occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Neither
 the Constitution nor the law specifically prohibits forced and bonded labor by chil-
 dren, but such practices are not known to occur (see Section 6.c.). There is no law
 establishing a minimum age for employment of children. While in practice there is
 no employment of children for wages, they often assist their families in subsistence
 farming activities. The FSM does have a compulsory education law which requires
 that all children begin school at the age of 6. Children may leave school when they
 reach the age of 14 or after completing the eighth grade, whichever comes first.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The four state governments have established
 minimum wage rates for government workers. Pohnpei has a minimum hourly wage
 rate of $2.00 for government and $1.35 for private workers. The other three states
 have established minimum hourly rates for only government workers, $1.25 for
 Chuuk; $1.35 for Kosrae; and $0.80 for Yap. The minimum hourly wage for employ-
 ment with the national Government is $1.68. These minimum wage structures and
 the wages customarily paid to skilled workers are sufficient to provide an acceptable
 standard of living under local conditions.
 There are no laws regulating hours of work (although a 40-hour workweek is
 standard practice) or prescribing standards of occupational safety and health. A fed-
 eral regulation requires that employers provide a safe place of employment. The De-
 partment of Health has no enforcement capability; working conditions vary in prac-
 tice.
 The FSM does not have any law for either the public or private sector which
 would permit workers to remove themselves from dangerous work situations with-
 out jeopardy to their continued employment.
