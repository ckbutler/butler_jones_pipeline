 LEBANON
 Lebanon's written Constitution provides for a directly
 elected, unicameral parliament which chooses the president.
 Political power is divided in accordance with the Constitution
 and with the unwritten, confessionally based National Pact of
 1943. The latter provides for a Maronite Catholic president,
 a Sunni Muslim prime minister, and a Shi'ite Muslim speaker of
 the National Assembly. The Pact provides also for the
 proportional allocation of government positions among various
 religious groups on the basis of the last national
 census--conducted in 1932. However, 13 years of civil war
 have altered greatly this arrangement. Parliamentary
 elections, which should take place every 4 years, were last
 held in 1972. Since that election, one-fifth of the elected
 parliamentarians have died and have not been replaced. In
 1988 Parliament was unable to elect a president before the
 constitutional deadline of September 23. The result was two
 rival cabinets, each claiming to be the legitimate government
 and paralyzing the little authority the central Government
 still possessed.
 The prolonged civil war also has reduced drastically the
 authority of the central Government and its ability to
 safeguard human rights. Extralegal militias control much of
 the country, where they, in effect, govern the civilian
 population and enforce their own version of justice without
 regard to the central Government or to legal norms.
 The presence of foreign forces further reduces those areis
 under government authority. Although Israel withdrew the bulk
 of its forces from south Lebanon in 1985, the Lebanese
 Government has yet to extend effective authority to that
 region. Israel maintains a "security zone" that encompasses
 13 percent of Lebanese territory and mounts ground and air
 operations against targets in south Lebanon which often result
 in civilian casualties.
 Syrian troops in Beirut, north Lebanon, and the Biqa' valley
 currently number about 35,000. In those areas, which comprise
 70 percent of Lebanon's territory, the Syrian authorities
 carry out security and other functions normally reserved to
 the central Government. Syrian efforts to put down local
 opposition also resulted in civilian casualties and material
 damage during the year.
 Already seriously disrupted by more than a decade of war,
 Lebanon's free enterprise economy barely held its own during
 1988. The value of the Lebanese pound improved slightly and
 remained stable during the spring and summer. However, in the
 fall, the pound began to fluctuate again in response to the
 instability of the political situation.
 The year brought no visible improvement in the human rights
 situation. As in previous years, major battles fought in
 densely populated areas brought injury and death to hundreds
 of civilians. Noncombatants were often the targets of
 violence in terrorist bombings, random shellings, sniping
 incidents, abductions, summary executions, and assassinations.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Rival factions routinely kill for political motives.
 Civilians have been victimized by car bombs exploded in
 crowded areas, indiscriminate shelling, and daily sniping
 across the demarcation line separating East and West Beirut.
 There have also been assassinations of political figures,
 claims of hostage execution, and death threats aimed at
 forcing specific political actions. Forces outside of
 government control were responsible for most of these actions,
 but opponents of the Lebanese Government charge that security
 forces and the Lebanese army have roles in both indiscriminate
 and planned attacks resulting in politically motivated
 deaths. As in the past, the establishment of culpability and
 the administration of just punishment did not follow any of
 the political killings or assassination attempts.
 Political killing has also resulted from both conventional
 warfare and from terrorist attacks. Residential areas in
 Beirut and elsewhere in south Lebanon were frequently the
 target of random shelling in 1988, the purpose of which often
 appeared to have been to kill or to intimidate civilians. In
 the first 9 months of 1988, 18 car bombs killed over 100
 civilians and wounded more than 300 in East and West Beirut,
 Tripoli, and Baalbeck. Intrafactional fighting was
 particularly intense during 1988. The Shi'ite militias of
 Amal and Hizballah fought in Beirut's southern suburbs and in
 south Lebanon, and clashes occurred between the Hobeika and
 Ja'Ja' factions of the Christian militias. Throughout the
 summer, pro- and anti-Arafat factions fought fiercely in the
 Palestinian refugee camps, resulting in the loss of civilian
 lives and the total destruction of several camps. Random
 confrontations between various militia groups often resulted
 in short, fierce street fights--usually at illegal
 checkpoints--but sometimes when carloads of roving militiamen
 encountered each other. Wounding, hostage-taking, and deaths
 frequently resulted from such chance encounters.
 In the first 9 months of 1988, there were nine assassinations
 which received media attention and numerous assassination
 attempts against prominent political, military, and
 educational figures. The attacks took the form of ambushes,
 rocket attacks on homes, car bombings, explosive devices
 planted in buildings and aircraft for remote detonation, and
 execution-style murders. Foreign diplomats and embassies also
 were targeted. Numerous political figures received death
 threats in the course of the year.
 b. Disappearance
 Thousands of Lebanon's inhabitants have been kidnaped and
 disappeared since the beginning of the war in 1975. Private
 militias and foreign forces, rather than official Lebanese
 security services, appear to be responsible for most of these
 kidnapings. Some victims probably were summarily executed.
 Most of these persons remain unaccounted for, but occasionally
 hostage exchanges and releases do occur.
 Politically motivated kidnapings continued in 1988.
 Abductions were particularly prevalent in West Beirut,
 
 
 1410
 LEBANON
 Beirut's southern suburbs, south Lebanon, and along the Green
 Line, which divides predominantly Christian East Beirut from
 mostly Muslim West Beirut. Some Lebanese were kidnaped
 because of their affiliation with rival militias, others
 because of interfamily disputes. Most, however, were
 civilians abducted simply on the basis of religion or for
 ransom. In this latter category, civilian seizures often
 tended to coincide with media coverage of sensitive political
 issues. Lebanese victims included, for example, Muslims
 traveling to East Beirut and Christians living or working in
 West Beirut. Abductions of foreign diplomats, journalists,
 businessmen, and academics continued in West Beirut and
 southern Lebanon. At the end of the year, nine Americans, two
 Britons, one Italian, one Irishman, and one Belgian remained
 hostage. One Indian (a U.S. permanent resident), kidnaped in
 1987, was released. Eight additional foreigners were
 kidnaped, an American with the U.N. Observer Force in south
 Lebanon, a Norwegian and a Swede working for the United
 Nations Relief and Works Agency in the south, a Briton with
 OXFAM UK, a Belgian doctor working with Medicine Without
 Frontiers, a German dual national, and two Swedish
 journalists. The Swedish journalists were held for only 105
 minutes. All but the American and the Belgian were released
 before year's end.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Overwhelmed by the presence of private militias and foreign
 forces, the official Lebanese security services control little
 territory, and relatively few allegations of torture are made
 against them. There are many allegations of brutal treatment
 by Lebanese militias, Syrian occupying forces, the
 Israeli-funded army of SouLh Lebanon, the Palestinians, and
 Hizballah. The truth of these allegations, often brought by
 fiercely partisan elements, can rarely be ascertained.
 In its 1988 Report, covering 1987, Amnesty International (AI)
 noted that the use of torture in Lebanon by governments and
 militias continued to be widely reported.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Lebanese law requires that a suspect must be arraigned before
 an accusation committee (a panel of three judges) and the
 prosecutor within 48 hours of arrest, but government
 prosecutors sometimes hold suspects indefinitely for
 interrogation without reference to a court or judge. Every
 defendant has the right to legal counsel, and bail is
 permitted in most cases. There is no public defender's
 office. However, if a defendant cannot afford a lawyer, and
 the judge deems he needs one, the judge requests the lawyers'
 association to appoint a lawyer to handle the case. No
 militia or foreign occupying force observes the legal
 safeguards which the Government is committed to apply in
 arrest cases. In general, persons arrested by these groups
 are denied access to the judicial system. Some of the major
 militia groups have periodically turned individuals accused of
 civil crimes over to the legal authorities. Normally,
 however, the various militias detain individuals arbitrarily
 for indefinite periods, often to be exchanged for persons held
 by rival militias. Such detainees are frequently held
 incommunicado. In addition to politically motivated
 abductions, some militias presume to enforce law and order in
 regions under their control, arresting, imprisoning, and
 
 
 1411
 LEBANON
 executing persons on purely criminal charges. The Lebanese
 Forces, a coalition of Christian militias, tried and executed
 two persons accused of plotting to assassinate the Lebanese
 Forces, leader. The Israeli-funded Army of South Lebanon
 maintains a detention center in Khiam, which neutral observers
 have not been allowed to visit.
 The Government does not, as a rule, arrest or exile its
 political opponents. Fear of assassination by political
 rivals has, however, driven several prominent Lebanese into
 voluntary exile, and the general decline in public security
 has stimulated the emigration of many Lebanese. With regard
 to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Lebanon has a regular court system for criminal and civil
 cases, and each confessional group has its own court for
 family and personal status cases. The military also has its
 own courts-martial system. Lebanese law, practice, and custom
 provide the right to a fair public trial. A decade of war,
 however, has disrupted the judicial process, and many cases
 remain unadjudicated. Trial delays result, for example, from
 the difficulty of conducting investigations when most of the
 country remains beyond effective government control, from a
 shortage of judges, and, most importantly, from the general
 breakdown in security.
 Although the judiciary is considered independent and
 relatively impartial, and courts are present throughout the
 country, the disposition of criminal cases ultimately depends
 on the group in power locally. For example, militias
 frequently intervene to protect their supporters from
 detention and prosecution.
 The Government does not sentence persons to imprisonment for
 essentially political beliefs or acts. As noted, however,
 militias frequently arrest and imprison members of opposing
 political and military groups. Also, in the case of persons
 arrested in connection with political assassination, the
 detention period without trial or recourse to a lawyer can
 drag on for years.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government generally has evinced no interest in
 controlling personal life. The law requires the Government to
 obtain the equivalent of a warrant before entering homes,
 except when the Lebanese army i& pursuing an armed attacker.
 Rights of privacy, however, are violated frequently in the
 course of military operations mounted by the army, militias,
 and foreign forces in Lebanon and in the militias'
 administration of areas under their control. All of these
 groups have attempted to gather intelligence on their
 adversaries; these efforts have included informer networks and
 telephone monitoring.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Lebanon has a strong heritage of freedom of opinion, speech,
 and press. The Government traditionally has protected the
 
 
 1412
 LEBANON
 rights of those who have opposed government policies through
 peaceful means.
 Dozens of newspapers and magazines representing a broad
 spectrum of opinion are freely published. Extralegal radio
 and television stations are operated by widely diverse
 political groups. Intimidation of journalists, including
 assassination attempts by militias and terrorists, constitute
 the most serious threat to press freedom. Newspaper editors
 were threatened with death if they published a portion of a
 speech by the Maronite patriarch in which he denounced the
 Christian militias' execution of two men whom the militias
 accused of plotting to assassinate the militias' leader.
 While there is an independent press in Lebanon, many
 newspapers and magazines are widely believed to receive
 financial backing from a number of other Middle Eastern
 states--most notably Syria, Libya, and Iran. For this reason,
 these publications reflect the opinions of their patrons on
 various internal, regional, and international issues.
 Christian militias have prevented the regular distribution in
 East Beirut of several leftist and Islamic publications, and
 militias in West Beirut have periodically refused to allow
 distribution of Christian militia and rival Muslim militia
 publications in their area of control. Amal, for example, has
 blocked distribution of Hizballah journals in south Lebanon.
 The widespread breakdown in security and intimidation of
 university faculty, administrators, and students continued to
 disrupt schools and universities and seriously threaten
 academic freedom. In early January, the dean of the School of
 Agriculture at the Lebanese University was stabbed to death,
 and the director of the Lebanese University's science branch
 was threatened with the same fate if he did not cancel a
 qualification test.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government places no restriction on the right of free
 assembly, as long as it does not incite popular unrest. Many
 groups in Lebanon--even the most radical--exercised their
 right to engage in peaceful demonstrations during the year.
 The major constraint, as in the past, came from the militias
 and foreign forces. In areas under the exclusive control of
 one militia, demonstrations or open shows of support for rival
 militias or political groups were not permitted.
 Political groups, such as those which opposed the Israeli
 occupation, are not permitted to operate freely in areas still
 under the control of the Israeli-backed militia. The Syrians
 do not, in general, allow groups openly hostile to them to
 remain in areas they occupy.
 The most noteworthy example of constraint of freedom of
 assembly occurred when Parliament attempted to meet and elect
 a president in August. Rival forces attempted to coerce
 parliamentarians living in territory they contrclled into
 attending or not attending the electoral session. After the
 first electoral session was postponed for lack of a quorum,
 each side redoubled its efforts in anticipation of a new date
 for the electoral session. Both sides attempted to prevent
 parliamentarians from traveling to areas controlled by the
 opposing side.
 
 
 1413
 LEBANON
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government affirms the right of freedom of worship, and
 Lebanese practice their various religions with a great degree
 of liberty. There is no state religion, nor are there
 restrictions on particular religious groups, on foreign
 clergy, or regarding places of worship. Lebanon has long been
 a center for theological training, and there are numerous
 theological seminaries in the country. The various religious
 groups are free to publish, religious material, participate in
 charitable activities, and provide religious education for
 their children. Many religious groups operate private schools.
 The 1943 National Pact essentially allocated political power
 on a confessional basis, according to the proportion of
 various religious groups in Lebanon as determined by the 1932
 census. The unwritten National Pact stipulated that the
 president would be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a
 Sunni Muslim, and the speaker of parliament a Shi'ite Muslim.
 Seats in the Parliament were divided on a six-to-five ratio of
 Christians to Muslims. Positions in the government
 bureaucracy were allocated on a similar basis. Some religious
 groups thus enjoy greater institutionalized political power
 than others, and it frequently has been charged that
 politically powerful groups have influenced government
 policies to the economic benefit of their coreligionists.
 Efforts to alter or abolish the confessional system of
 allocating political power have been at the center of Lebanese
 politics for more than three decades. Those religious groups
 most favored by the 1943 formula have sought to preserve it,
 while those'who feel disadvantaged by it have sought to revise
 it on the basis of new demographic realities or to abolish it
 entirely. This struggle has given a strongly religious
 coloration to Lebanese politics and to the continuing civil
 strife there.
 The intensification of religious hatreds has led away from
 confessional mixing and towards confessional segregation.
 Today, Lebanese live more and more in neighborhoods and
 villages inhabited exclusively by one religious community. In
 militia-controlled areas, this exclusivity sometimes is
 maintained by force.
 While Lebanese are free to practice the religion into which
 they were born, the confessional character of Lebanese society
 makes conversion to another religion difficult. Conversion
 can mean ostracism from one's family and friends, and having
 to live among strangers. In the smaller villages, local
 religious leaders often exert pressure on members of their
 congregation not to participate in the religious activities of
 other religious groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Lebanese traditionally have enjoyed freedom of internal
 travel, but militia groups have greatly circumscribed this
 freedom through the establishment of checkpoints to keep those
 deemed undesirable out of areas under their control. The
 Green Line bisecting East and West Beirut was closed
 intermittently during 1988. Closure of the Green Line
 effectively divides the city and paralyzes many aspects of
 
 
 1414
 LEBANON
 daily life in Beirut. Crossing the Green Line even when it is
 open remains extremely risky. The Army of South Lebanon
 maintained tight restrictions on the movement of people and
 goods into and out of areas which it occupied.
 The Government does not restrict foreign travel by Lebanese
 citizens. Emigration and dual citizenship are permitted.
 There is no legal impediment to voluntary repatriation by
 Lebanese with valid identity papers.
 Because of the sporadic closure of the Green Line, fighting
 and kidnapings along the road to Beirut International Airport,
 and chaotic security conditions at the airport itself, many
 Lebanese encountered serious difficulties in traveling
 abroad. Travelers unable or unwilling to risk using Beirut
 International Airport, which is located in West Beirut, had
 the option of traveling overland to Damascus or using a ferry
 which runs between Jounieh in East Beirut and Larnaca, Cyprus.
 Lebanon historically has been a land of asylum. During this
 century, it has given refuge to hundreds of thousands of
 Armenians and Palestinians as well as to smaller numbers from
 other Middle Eastern ethnic and religious groups. Lebanon's
 political and economic troubles in recent years have
 diminished its appeal to refugees.
 Lebanon's relationship with the Palestinian community has been
 difficult. Most Palestinians, like other foreigners, have not
 been able to obtain Lebanese citizenship. Their status as a
 "state within a state" under the 1969 Cairo Accords (abrogated
 in 1987) and their involvement in internal fighting from 1975
 to 1982 and again from 1985 until 1988 brought upon them the
 bitter enmity of many other groups. In the wake of the 1982
 conflict, many Palestinians encountered difficulty in renewing
 residence permits and travel documents, and delays still
 continue. During 1988 several instances of forced
 resettlement occurred. The Christian militias expelled 60
 Shi'ite families living in the village of Mogheira, which the
 militia leaders considered part of the "Christian" enclave.
 In south Lebanon, a militant Muslim fundamentalist group
 expelled 20 Christian and Druze families from the village of
 Qatrani because the village impeded their military advance
 towards Army of South Lebanon positions.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 In practice, Lebanese citizens do not enjoy the right to
 change their government. Formally, Lebanon is a parliamentary
 democracy. According to its Constitution, direct elections
 must be held for its 99-member parliament every 4 years.
 Parliament, in turn, elects a president every 6 years, and the
 president appoints a cabinet which must obtain the confidence
 of parliament. Political parties may be formed. In theory,
 women enjoy the same civil rights as men, but, in actuality,
 women play almost no significant role in Lebanese politics.
 In the past decade, violence has dominated the political
 process as militia groups and foreign forces have resorted to
 force to gain their way and have thus robbed democratic
 institutions of much of their substance. No parliamentary
 elections have been held since 1972, and Parliament was unable
 to decide upon a new president before the incumbent
 president's term expired on September 23. The result was a
 stalemate out of which two rival cabinets emerged, effectively
 
 
 1415
 LEBANON
 paralyzing what little authority the central Government
 continued to exercise. Most of the country is under foreign
 occupation or militia control.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has a mixed record in dealing with
 international human rights groups, and indigenous groups have
 not pressed the Government strongly on human rights issues.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination based on religion is built into the system of
 government. As a result of the National Pact of 1943,
 government jobs are allocated on the ratio of six Christians
 for every five Muslims. Many of the larger corporations
 adhere to these standards as well. In the beginning, this
 apportionment helped the Muslims, especially the Shilite
 Muslims, because they had traditionally been the poorer and
 less well-educated section of the population. The six-to-five
 ratio made positions available to them that they would not
 have gotten otherwise. By 1988, however, the Shi'ite Muslims
 constituted the largest confessional group in Lebanon, and the
 six-to-five ratio worked to their disadvantage.
 Palestinians also have been discriminated against in the area
 of employment, because the Government has denied them
 permission to obtain work permits. The Government's position
 has been that there are not enough jobs for Lebanese who want
 them, and thus it cannot open up the Lebanese work force to
 any outsiders. The result has been that Palestinian refugees,
 who were often skilled workers, had to take menial or marginal
 jobs.
 The lower class as a whole has been discriminated against in
 the area of education, because the Government underfunds the
 public school system. Any Lebanese who is able to send his
 children to private schools does so. Poorer families who
 cannot afford private schools must use the inadequate public
 schools, giving their children little hope of passing the
 qualifying exams which make them eligible for higher education.
 Women enjoy equality of civil rights and attend institutions
 of higher learning in large numbers. Women comprised
 one-third of the work force in 1988. Most of the women still
 work in occupations traditionally considered "women's"
 occupations, such as teaching, nursing, and secretarial and
 clerical positions, as well as in the banking and textile
 industries. However, an increasing number of women now work
 in traditionally male occupations, especially the professions
 and fields such as journalism. The only field devoid of women
 is politics. This is in part a result of the fact that
 parliamentary elections have not been held since 1972, and
 women have not had an opportunity to run for public office.
 The women's organizations that do exist are, for the most
 part, subordinate arms of political parties which work to
 advance the interest of the parent party rather than that of
 women in general.
 Each confessional group has its own family and personal status
 laws. Generally, it is difficult for women to obtain
 divorces, and in the event of divorce they may have difficulty
 
 
 1416
 LEBANON
 obtaining custody of their children.  There are no
 restrictions in regard to women owning property.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Lebanese labor law gives workers the right to unionize; choose
 their own representatives, provided they are employed within
 the bargaining unit; and determine their own policies and
 programs as long as the unions do not involve themselves in
 politics. Workers have the right to strike, and they exercise
 it. The Government does not control or restrict unions,
 except that government employees may not unionize or strike.
 The Government also does not offer any special protection to
 the person and property of trade unionists. There are 160
 local labor unions in Lebanon. The major labor umbrella
 organization, the General Confederation of Lebanese Workers
 (CGTL), is comprised of 18 federations of labor unions. There
 are no comprehensive statistics on union membership, although
 the CGTL claims 200,000 to 250,000 dues-paying members, which
 is about one-third of the 600,000 employed persons in
 Lebanon. The CGTL sends representatives to International
 Labor Organization (ILO) meetings, and is affiliated with the
 International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions (ICATU) based
 in Damascus. Thirteen of its affiliated federations belong to
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions,
 headquartered in Brussels. Another affiliated federation is a
 member of the Prague-based World Federation of Trade Unions
 (WFTU).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right of workers to organize into unions and bargain
 collectively exists in law and practice in Lebanon. Most
 workers' groups engage in some form of collective bargaining
 with their employers. The stronger federations, such as the
 federation of bank employees' unions and the Airline Pilots
 Association, have been able to obtain significant gains
 through their own collective bargaining efforts. The weaker
 unions rely heavily on the mediation of the CGTL which, prior
 to the civil war, used to negotiate annual across-the-board
 pay increases with the private employers' association. Often
 the CGTL assists unions which are not affiliated with it in
 their bargaining efforts, and it even assists nonunionized
 workers. There is no government mechanism to promote
 voluntary worker-employee negotiations, and workers are not
 protected against antiunion discrimination. An example of
 such discrimination occurred when an outspoken leader in one
 of the teachers' unions was fired by the school in which he
 taught. His dismissal effectively silenced him because he was
 no longer qualified to hold a leadership position in the union.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Government does not use forced labor. In the present
 anarchy, however, militias have forced workers, especially
 immigrant laborers, to perform unpaid duties such as filling
 sandbags for use in building defenses against attack and
 cleaning of militia offices. Hospitals and physicians are
 sometimes also required to provide services free to the army
 and the militias. In the case of the army, the mechanism for
 reimbursement exists, but the Government has not fulfilled its
 obligations for several years. The militias use the authority
 of the gun to claim the same privilege as the army. This
 
 
 1417
 LEBANON
 wide-scale nonpayment for medical services has contributed
 significantly to the growing emigration of doctors.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Lebanese labor law lists the minimum age for employment of
 children at 8 years (ILO convention No. 60, which Lebanon has
 not signed, limits employment of children under age 14 to
 light work for no more than 2 hours a day). In fact, few
 children under 16 years of age are employed.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 According to Lebanese labor law, the minimum wage is $37.50
 per month at the fall 1988 exchange rate. From this sum,
 income and social security taxes are deducted. Persons living
 in militia-controlled areas also have to pay income taxes to
 the militias. Both labor union leaders and government
 officials agree that the average family needs a monthly income
 equivalent to $100 to $200 to live decently. If the Lebanese
 pound strengthens from its current exchange rate of 400
 Lebanese lira to the dollar to 100 lira to the dollar, a
 person earning the minimum wage would have an acceptable
 income. The Government chose to retain the current minimum
 wage, apparently hoping that the exchange rate would improve.
 The Lebanese work a 6-day week. According to Lebanese labor
 law, the maximum number of hours a person may work per week is
 48. In practice, workers in the industrial sector work an
 average of 35 hours a week, and workers in the other sectors
 of the economy work an average of 30"hours a week. Lebanese
 labor law includes specific occupational health and safety
 regulation*. However, given the civil strife and weakness of
 the central Government, most of the regulations are not
 enforced.
