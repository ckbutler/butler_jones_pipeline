 MALTA
 Malta is a constitutional republic and parliamentary democracy. Executive power
 is vested in a President who appoints as Prime Minister the leader of the party that
 gains a plurality of seats in the quinquennial elections for the unicameral legisla-
 ture. The two major political parties reflect widely divergent political views. The Na-
 tionalist Party, which was brought back to power in 1987 after 16 years of Labor
 Party rule won reelection in 1992 with a three seat majority in Parliament.
 Law eniorcement and internal security are the responsibility of the Malta police
 under the command of a civilian commissioner. The Minister of Home Affairs and
 Social Development has jurisdiction over the police. Specially trained riot police
 form part of the regular police force. There were no allegations of human rights
 abuses by the police force during the year.
 The Maltese economy is a mixture of state-owned and privately owned industry.
 Tourism and light manufacturing industry are the largest contributors to the econ-
 omy. Foreign investment is actively promoted. The Government is attempting to de-
 velop Malta as a container transshipment point, as a center for offshore business
 and ship registration, and as a regional air transport center.
 The Maltese Government is strongly committed to human rights. Constitutional
 protection for the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual is upheld by
 an independent judiciary.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 extrajudi ia killing
 b. Disappearance.-There were no instances of political disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment. These
 prohibitions are generally respected in practice. Several prison disturbances in 1993
 resulted in a formal government inquiry into prison conditions. The inquiry report
 noted deteriorated conditions and proposed future remedial action. In response, the
 Government acknowledged the need for prison improvement and program reform
 and launched a facilities rehabilitation project and introduced educational programs.
 Although these initial efforts were largely superficial, attempts at more meaningful
 
 
 972
 change are under consideration. While prisons are old and lack other than essential
 facilities, prison conditions are not such as would inordinately threaten life or
 health.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Freedom from arbitrary arrest and de-
 tention is provided for in the Constitution and generally respected in practice. The
 police may on the basis of reasonable suspicion, arrest a person for questioning.
 Within 48 hours, persons so arrested must be brought before the court and charged
 or released. They have no right to legal counsel during this 48-hour period. Persons
 incarcerated pending trial are granted access to counsel, and periodic hearings are
 mandatory. Provision for bail exists.
 Political exile is prohibited by law. No cases of exile were reported.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution requires a fair public trial before
 an impartial court. Defendants have the right to counsel of their choice, including
 court-appointed counsel at public expense, if necessary. Defendants enjoy a pre-
 sumption of innocence, may confront witnesses and present evidence and have a
 right of a ppeal. The courts' jurisdiction is limited in certain areas. Lay tribunals
 (e.g., the Industrial Tribunal and the Inheritance Partition Tribunal) have exclusive
 authority over certain judicial functions. Defendants before these tribunals may be
 represented by attorneys.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Privacy
 of the home is protected in the Constitution and generally respected in practice. Po-
 lice officers of the rank of inspector and above may issue search warrants without
 a court order. Electronic surveillance is prohibited by law.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of expression in speech and press is
 protected by the Constitution and generally respected in practice. An exception is
 the 1987 constitutional amendment that bans foreign participation in local politics
 (e.g., guest foreign speakers sponsored by a political party) during the  riod prior
 to an election. Maltese libel law is largely modeled on British libe law. he dynam-
 ics of a small society result in some self-censorship, particularly on nonpolitical mat-
 ters. Both major political parties either own or are affiliated with major daily news-
 papers and radio stations and openly criticize the other in the media and in public.
 The 1991 Broadcast Law established pluralism in the broadcast media. Two gov-
 ernment-owned stations, a Maltese/Libyan regional short-wave station, and eight
 private radio stations associated with political parties, the Roman Catholic Church
 and commercial interests, operated in 1993. In addition to the government-owned
 television broadcasting system, a commercial cable television company, which began
 operations in 1992, offers diverse broadcast options, including Italian, British,
 French, German, and American channels. In 1993 the Broadcasting Act was amend-
 ed to allow holders of radio licenses to hold television licenses also. Some commer-
 cial interests, as well as one of the two major political parties, have since submitted
 applications for two available television licenses.
 Eleven newspapers-three daily, seven weekly and one fortnightly-.freely express
 diverse views. They are associated with political parties, labor unions, and the
 Roman Catholic Church, as well as with commercial interests.
 Academic freedom is generally respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly. Police permits are routinely issued for political meet-
 ings and other public activities of political parties or groups of citizens.
 Membership and participation in political parties are voluntary. However, strong
 societal (e.g., family or employment) pressure exists for affiliation with particular
 parties. A worker may not be fired for refusal to join a particular political party or
 e refused a job if not a party member.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution protects the freedom to practice the re-
 ligion of one's choice and this is respected. The dominant religion is Roman Catholi-
 cism; small groups freely practice other religions. There are no laws prohibiting
 evangelizing or proselytizing. Government subsidies are granted only to Roman
 Catholic schools. Students enrolled in government schools have the option at any
 stage to decline instruction in the Roman Catholic faith.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Movement within the country, foreign travel, and emigration are gen-
 erally not restricted, but civil rights groups, including the Association of Men's
 Rights, continue to criticize the "impediments of Departure," a court action which
 may prohibit a person from departing the country for such offenses as nonpayment
 of debts or nonsupport of an estranged wife or children. Maltese emigrants who
 have acquired the citizenship of another country and have resided abroad for a min-
 
 
 imum of 6 years may hold dual citizenship. Maltese born abroad must renounce
 their foreign citizenship by age 18 if they wish to retain Maltese citizenship.
 Several hundred persons of various nationalities, many of them Iraqis, sought ref-
 uge in Malta in 1992, and the influx continued in 1993 to a level of approximately
 700. Although foreign nationals seeking refugee status are not permitted to remain
 permanently in Malta, they often are granted employment permits (or undertake il-
 legal employment) while awaiting resettlement in a third country. The Emigrants'
 Commission, which was established in 1987 as the local representative of the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), provides assistance and coun-
 seling for refugees while awaiting UNHCR review of their cases.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Malta is a parliamentary democracy in which the incumbent Nationalist Party
 and the opposition Malta Labor Party are important forces in daily life. Elections
 in which all parties participate freely are held every 5 years, with universal suffrage
 for those 18 years of age or over. In the 1992 election, 96 percent of the electorate
 voted.
 Section 4. Government Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several human rights organizations and persons interested in promoting and pro-
 tecting human rights operate freely. The Government, strongly committed to human
 rights, places no restrictions on investigations by international human rights
 groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-All Maltese citizens have a legal right of access to housing, employment,
 and education on a nondiscriminatory basis. However, tradition and local culture
 have often separated women's rights from the overall concern for human rights, and
 enforcement of equal rights laws has been passive. Due to economic necessity and
 changing social patterns, women constitute a growing portion of the work force.
 Most women remain in traditional "women's jobs" such as sales clerks, secretaries,
 bank tellers, teachers, or nurses, or achieve success in family-owned businesses or
 selected professions (i.e., medicine). Women generally earn less than their male
 counterparts. In August Parliament passed legislation granting women equality in
 matters of family law. Similarly, a 1991 constitutional amendment which became
 effective in July 1993, commits the Government to promote equal economic, social,
 cultural, civic, and political rights for all persons regardless of sex and to undertake
 appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination between the sexes. Remnants of
 discriminatory language within existing laws are undergoing revision.
 Victims of sexual discrimination have redress before the criminal courts. However,
 as no sexual discrimination cases have been argued before the courts, the actual
 limits of police or court support for such cases has not been tested. A pending case
 raises the question of a daughter's right to assume her father's union shipyard job
 after his death, a privilege previously accorded the eldest son.
 Recent changes in the law appear to have had little effect on day-to-day life as
 many cultural patterns that appear discriminator remain in place by general con-
 sensus. Women s primary accepted roles remain those of wife and mother. Cultural
 pressure reinforces these roles. Women continue to be underrepresented in manage-
 ment, government, and politics. Family violence against women and children has re-
 ceived increased attention, which has led in turn to an increased number of reported
 cases. A special police unit and several voluntary organizations provide support in
 cases of domestic violence. A government emergency fund and subsidized shelter for
 battered women offers assistance for verbally and physically abused women.
 Trafficking in prostitution is a serious offense under Maltese law; traffickers are
 subject to heavy penalties. Rape and violent indecent assault likewise carry heavy
 penalties under the law. The law does not distinguish between rape inside and out-
 side marriage.
 Divorce is not legal in Malta.
 Children.-The rights of children and their role in society have generally been
 viewed within the larger context of family law. The Government has preferred to
 remain neutral in such matters. However, legislation aimed at guaranteeing and
 protecting children's rights is under consideration. As public awareness has in-
 creased, so has the number of reported cases of child abuse. However, there is no
 indication that the actual number of cases has increased, but rather the number re-
 ported.
 
 
 People with Disabilities.-Numerous pieces of legislation exist to protect the rights
 of the disabled, including the 1969 Employment of Disabled Persons Act which en-
 sures employment opportunities for the disabled. The 1992 Structure Plan set forth
 policies requiring accessibility to buildings and public transport. Basic educational
 and training programs for persons with physical or mental disabilities are available.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Labor rights are traditionally well protected in
 Malta. Workers have the right to associate freely and to strike, a right respected
 in practice. Only uniformed personnel of the armed forces and police are prohibited
 from striking. In 1993 there were 24 registered trade unions, representing about 50
 percent of the workforce. Although all unions are independent of 'political parties,
 the largest uion, the General Workers' Union, is perceved as having a close asso-
 ciation with the Malta Labor Party. During the year there were 10 strikes which
 resulted in the loss of 2,480 work days. The major strike was in public transport
 (bus service) with a loss of 1,300 workdays. Otier strikes were centered on the
 banking, cargo handling (ports), and public works industries. Under the Industrial
 Relations Act of 1976, the responsible minister may refer disputes to the Industrial
 Tribunal for binding settlement. The International Labor Organization (ILO) Com-
 mittee of Experts objected again in 1993 to the provision that permits compulsory
 arbitration at the request of only one of the parties, but local labor and employers
 appear to have no objection to it. No disputes were referred to the Industrial Tribu-
 nal in 1993. In practice, a striking union can ignore an unfavorable decision by con-
 tinuing the strike on other grounds.
 There is no prohibition on unions affiliating internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers are free, in law and
 practice, to organize and bargain collectively. While most wages are negotiated be-
 tween unions and employers, the Government in 1990 mandated a substantial na-
 tionwide wage increase after reaching agreement with the unions and employers. In
 December 1990 the Government, trade unions, and employers signed a comprehen-
 sive agreement regulating industrial relations and income policy. Cost-of-living in-
 creases are now established in accordance with government statistics based on the
 retail price index as calculated by a tripartite independent committee. During the
 agreement's 3-year term, which was due to expire in December the Malta Council
 for Economic Development informs the partners semiannualfy of the projected
 changes in the price index. The projections served as a basis for negotiating collec-
 tive agreements. According to the Industrial Relations Act, an employer may not
 take action against any employee for participation or membership in a trade union.
 Complaints may be addressed through a court of law or an industrial tribunal com-
 posed of one representative each of the employer, union, and government. As most
 disputes are resolved directly between the parties involved, few are brought before
 the court or tribunal. However, for the few which have been, both methods of neo-
 tiation proved effective. Complaints of discrimination may also be lodged with t e
 Commission Against Injustices. Workers fired solely for union activities must be re-
 instated. An October 1993 Employment Commission decision awarded two Malta
 drydocks workers substantial compensation for having been routinely denied over-
 time opportunities because of their political beliefs. All workers, both union and
 nonunion, are protected from discrimination although it has not been necessary for
 the Government to enforce the matter activefy.
 Malta has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulso7 Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by the
 Constitution and does not exist. Any claimed violations could be submitted for adju-
 dication to the Constitutional Court.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Children younger than 16 years
 may not legally be employed. The law is generally respected although instances of
 employment of underage children as domestics, restaurant kiitchen help, and ven-
 dors during summer months occur. The Department of Labor, which is responsible
 for enforcement of the law, does so effectively. Due to economic necessity and the
 family nature of many businesses, enforcement of summer employment of underage
 youth is occasionally lax.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage, $103 (40.33 Malta
 liri) per week, which is generally enforced, provides a decent standard of living for
 a worker and family when government subsidies for housing, health care, and free
 education are added. In addition to the minimum wage, employers are required to
 pay an annual bonus of approximately $295 (116 Malta lir), half payable in March
 and half in September. The Government pays a worker a marriagebnus of approxi-
 mately $2.55 (1.00 Malta liri) weekly and an annual child assistance payment fur
 each child under 16 years of age beginning at approximately $500 (195 Malta liri)
 
 
 975
 for the first child, $390 (153.40 Malta liii) for the second child, and $260 (101.40
 Malta liri) for each additional child. The average Maltese family is commonly viewed
 as a working husband, wife and two children.
 Hours of work are regulated by wage council orders for various trades. For most
 sectors the standard is 40 hours per week, but in some trades the standard before
 overtime is paid is 43 or 45 hours per week. Government labor regulations prescribe
 daily rest periods of 1 hour. The annual paid vacation mandated by law is currently
 22 working days. In general, these laws and regulations are effectively enforced by
 the Department of Labor.
 Despite several years' discussion, the government-proposed establishment of an
 authority for workers' health, safety, and welfare still has not occurred. Enforce-
 ment of occupational health and safety standards, the responsibility of the Depart-
 ment of Labor, has been lax. Reports of an increasing number of industrial accidents
 in 1993 add credence to the concerns of some that existing laws may be outdated
 and inadequate to protect workers effectively.
