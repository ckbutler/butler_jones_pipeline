 KUWAIT
 Kuwait's amirs, drawn from the Al-Sabah family, have
 traditionally governed in consultation with several
 commercially powerful families and other community leaders.
 The 1962 Constitution contains detailed provisions on the
 powers and relationships of the branches of government and on
 the rights of citizens. Kuwait's National Assembly
 institutionalizes a degree of consultation with the ruling
 family and serves as an outlet for popular expression,
 including criticism of the Government. Political activity is
 restricted by the ban on political parties.
 Kuwaitis are a minority in their own country, comprising 40
 percent of the total population. Kuwaiti citizens are 60-65
 percent Sunni Muslim; the remainder are Shi'ite Muslim and a
 tiny minority of Christians. Although the members of Kuwait's
 Shi'a minority perceive themselves to be largely excluded from
 leadership positions in the Government, many have achieved
 great wealth. The Iranian revolution has made Kuwait's
 leadership more aware of the potential for Shi'a subversion.
 Meanwhile, the majority Sunni community has experienced an
 upsurge of Islamic fundamentalism which frequently conflicts
 with attitudes of the traditionally moderate members of the
 merchant class. Kuwait's expatriate population includes
 300,000 Palestinian long-term residents, many in their second
 generation. Non-Kuwaitis are given due process under the law
 but have few other civil and political rights.
 Although the Government restricts the political and civil
 rights of all residents, and particularly those of women and
 expatriates, it rarely violates the integrity of the
 individual. Kuwait's security apparatus is used primarily to
 maintain internal order. It does not engage in political
 repression.
 Increased political turbulence and rising terrorism in the
 region during 1985 affected the human rights situation in
 Kuwait. The role of Kuwait's security organizations increased
 substantially, particularly with regard to the noncitizen
 community. Terrorist acts, widely believed to be foreign-
 inspired, continued with the attempted assassination of the
 Chief of State and the bombings of two public cafes. A
 prominent Kuwaiti newspaper editor was seriously wounded in an
 assassination attempt, and an Iraqi diplomat and his son were
 shot to death in their home. The violence has led to a
 further increase in security measures and legal restrictions
 on public gatherings and dissemination of "subversive"
 literature. Increased attention to law and order is also
 viewed by some Kuwaitis as a means to protect their society
 against the threat they perceive to Kuwaiti moral and social
 values from the large foreign population. Since the beginning
 of the current cycle of terrorism with the December 1983
 bombings of Kuwait installations and the American and French
 embassies, security organizations have assiduously applied
 regulations governing expatriate presence in Kuwait and, since
 the attempt on the Amir's life in May 1985, Kuwaiti officials
 have publicly acknowledged the deportation of over 15,000
 non-Kuwaitis. Internal socioeconomic changes brought on by
 sudden oil-related wealth, coupled in recent years with
 violent revolution in Iran and the Iran-Iraq war, have also
 led to a growing demand by well-organized groups for stricter
 controls over public morality and political expression. A
 resurgent Islamic fundamentalist movement advocates adoption
 of a more stringent legal code based on Islamic Shari'a law.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 In March, 1985, an Iraqi diplomat and his son were killed by
 unidentified gunmen. No group claimed responsibility for the
 killings, but agents of a foreign government were suspected.
 No arrests in the case were made.
 In May, a car bomb attempt was made against the life of the
 Chief of State, Amir Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah. Four persons,
 in addition to the suicide bomber, died in the attempt, but
 Amir Jaber was only slightly wounded. Although callers
 purporting to be members of at least two organizations claimed
 responsibility for the attack, no one had been indicted by the
 end of 1985.
 In July, 10 persons were killed and a number wounded when
 bombs detonated at two public cafes. A caller purporting to
 be a member of the Arab Revolutionary Brigades claimed
 responsibility. No one had been indicted by the end of 1985.
 In both the attempt on the Amir and the cafe bombings, the
 complicity of groups supported by foreign governments was
 widely suspected.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported disappearances in 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Local security forces, without authorization, occasionally use
 physical violence when interrogating individuals suspected of
 committing criminal acts. These incidents do not appear to be
 widespread or condoned. Non-Kuwaitis are more likely to
 receive rough treatment than are Kuwaitis, and the seriousness
 of the suspected crime also appears to be a determining
 factor. Evidence of mistreatment during interrogation is a
 defense in Kuwait's courts and has led to the release of a
 number of suspects.
 Kuwait's prisons are managed along modern lines. Treatment is
 humane, and the Government provides food and other
 necessities. Young offenders, few of whom are imprisoned, are
 separated from persons charged or convicted of serious
 crimes. There is no policy of discriminatory treatment among
 prisoners for racial or religious reasons.
 Large numbers of expatriates were detained, and many of them
 deported, following the attempt on the Amir's life in May 1985
 and the cafe bombings in July. Because of limited space in
 detention centers--frequently local police jails--there were
 reports that detainees did not receive adequate food and that
 hygienic conditions were poor. However, accusations by Iran
 that some detainees were tortured and killed by the
 authorities have not been substantiated.
 The legal process is based in part on Islamic law, but
 punishments such as mutilation or stoning are not permitted.
 Some fundamentalist members of the National Assembly have
 
 
 1290
 KUWAIT
 attempted to force the Government to adopt Islamic law fully,
 and by extension its harsh punishments, as the only basis for
 legal process, but their efforts have not been successful.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment are prohibited by the
 Constitution. In 1985, there was no confirmation that persons
 had been detained for political reasons. Persons may not be
 denied due process or held for more than 4 days without
 charge, and a prosecutor's approval is required for detention
 periods beyond 24 hours. Thereafter the suspect must either
 be released or charged by a prosecutor, who may authorize
 detention for up to an additional 21 days. Further detention
 pending trial may be authorized by a judge. Warrants are
 required unless a person is apprehended in the act of
 committing an offense. These procedures are followed in
 practice. Road blocks and spot checks of outdoor gatherings
 of expatriates, especially of South Asians, are used
 sporadically by the police searching for illegal immigrants
 and contraband liquor. Persons without proper identification
 may be detained by the police under the procedures described
 above.
 A number of Kuwaitis and non-Kuwaitis were detained and
 interrogated following the 1985 terrorist bombings. There
 were a number of reports that local authorities focused their
 searches for inadequately documented expatriates on Shi'a
 Muslims of Iranian, Iraqi, and Lebanese origin, leading to
 some arbitrary detentions. In August 1985, the Government
 publicly acknowledged that legal procedures had been ignored
 in some instances, but stated that such practices would be
 halted. Although there have been unconfirmed reports of
 incommunicado detention, it does not appear to be a common
 practice.
 No Kuwaiti citizen may be exiled or denied return to Kuwait.
 However, a noncitizen, even if a long-term resident, may be
 summarily expelled without a specific charge against him if
 considered a troublemaker by the authorities. As a result of
 security measures taken following the May-July 1985 terrorist
 bombings. a substantially larger number of non-Kuwaitis were
 deported in 1985 than in previous years. The great majority,
 however, were persons who had arrived in Kuwait illegally or
 whose residence permits had expired.
 There is no forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Kuwait's judicial system is independent and provides for
 public trial, the right of appeal, and representation by an
 attorney of one's choice. Failure of the police to respect a
 suspect's rights may provide a defense in the courts. Trials
 in absentia have occurred. In such cases, the defendant is
 allowed an additional right of appeal. There are no reports
 of secret or unfair trials or of discrimination against
 defense counsel. However, the court-appointed attorney of a
 defendant unable to engage his own lawyer is not always given
 adequate time to prepare a defense. Interpretation of court
 proceedings to ensure their understanding by non-Arabic-
 speaking defendants is sometimes inadequate. According to the
 Constitution, military courts have jurisdiction only over
 offenses committed by members of the armed or security forces,
 
 
 1291
 KUWAIT
 except during periods of martial law (which has never been
 declared in Kuwait). The Amir has the power to pardon or to
 commute sentences passed by either civilian or military courts
 and does so through the publication of an annual list of
 commutations following major religious holidays. The only
 known prisoners currently jailed for politically related acts
 are 17 persons convicted of participating in the December 1983
 bombings which had resulted in several deaths. Three of the
 prisoners were sentenced to death, but their executions, which
 must be ordered by the Amir, were still pending at the end of
 1985.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right to individual privacy and sanctity of the home is
 provided for in the Constitution and generally respected in
 practice. Warrants are required to search, unless the police
 are in hot pursuit of a suspect fleeing the scene of a crime
 or where there is an indication of the presence of alcohol or
 illegal narcotics. Search warrants to enter residences or
 businesses are issued by a public prosecutor. Expatriates,
 and particularly common laborers and servants who live in
 accommodations provided by their employers, may have their
 premises searched by the police with authorization only of the
 employer. Following the May and July 1985 bombings, security
 authorities occasionally did not follow these procedures. In
 several such instances, however, cases were filed against the
 officials in court and the police were warned against such
 actions.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Constitutional guarantees in this area are conditional,
 modified by such phrases as "in accordance with conditions and
 manner specified by law." The average Kuwaiti or Kuwait
 resident feels free to offer his opinion in private without
 fear of official retaliation. No one may make a written or
 public attack upon the Amir and the ruling family, upon Islam,
 or upon leaders of friendly Arab states. Kuwait has an active
 censorship department, which reviews all books, films,
 videotapes, periodicals, and other material entering Kuwait in
 bulk or for commercial purposes. In practice, references to
 the State of Israel are often excised from educational
 materials, reference works, and maps. Items arriving by post
 for individuals or institutional use are usually not opened
 before delivery, unless the contents are suspected of being
 pornographic. Printed and visual material produced within
 Kuwait is not subject to precensorship, but is liable to
 government action after publication or release. Radio and
 television are government-owned and controlled.
 The Kuwaiti press is not precensored. Articles and editorials
 critical of government action or of individuals appear
 frequently. The press law sets down several categories which
 are restricted. These include direct criticism of the Amir
 and the ruling family; official confidential communications or
 treaties and agreements with other states; material which
 might disturb relations with Arab and friendly states or which
 might prove embarrassing to their heads of state; and a
 general category of stories which "might incite people to
 commit crimes, create hatred, or spread dissension among the
 
 
 1292
 KUWAIT
 people." In practice, the list is interpreted selectively and
 violators are usually only issued warnings. Although no such
 incidents occurred in 1985, editors and publishers are liable
 to imprisonment and fines for violations. The Government
 permits the use of languages other than Arabic in speech,
 print, and private schools.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political parties are banned. Political activity finds some
 outlet in social clubs and religious gatherings known as
 "diwaniyyas." The Constitution protects the right to private
 assembly, public meetings, processions, and gatherings which
 are peaceful and not contrary to public morals. However, any
 group of more than three people desiring to meet for public
 discussion (or to meet privately but to issue a public
 statement) must receive prior permission from the Ministry of
 Interior. The authorities may prevent such an assembly merely
 by ignoring the request. During 1985 there were no mass
 gatherings, except those associated with religious
 observances. During a Shi'a religious commemoration with
 potential political overtones in September, security forces
 were highly evident although they did not interfere.
 Kuwait permits trade unions, although only government
 employees and the petroleum, banking, and airline sectors are
 unionized. The majority of union members are civil servants.
 Kuwaiti citizens are allowed to establish and join unions.
 Unions may draw up their own constitutions, formulate their
 own programs, and join confederations. Many union activities
 are, however, funded by the Government and subject to
 government approval. Workers have the right to bargain
 collectively. The right to strike, though seldom exercised,
 is recognized. Kuwaiti labor law has a provision allowing for
 compulsory dissolution of any union that "commits an act
 considered to be violating the provisions of this law and of
 the laws connected with the preservation of public order and
 morals." Expatriate workers, who comprise the majority of the
 labor force, are permitted to join unions after five years
 residence. Non-Kuwaitis are not, however, permitted to vote,
 hold office, or form unions. They are described as "associate
 members" of the unions. Since each union must be formed by
 and have several Kuwaiti members, expatriate unskilled workers
 have no union representation.
 In the spring of 1985, some oil workers struck to protest the
 required performance of additional tasks not in their job
 descriptions. Port workers struck in the summer to demand
 higher wages. There is no apparent harassment of professional
 groups, bar associations, scientific bodies, or labor unions,
 which are also allowed to participate in international
 bodies. The Kuwait Federation of Trade Unions, grouping the
 government and petroleum workers, is a member of the
 International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and the World
 Federation of Trade Unions. Kuwait is an active member of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO). In 1984, the ILO
 requested Kuwait to amend its labor laws to bring them into
 conformity with various ILO conventions to which it is a
 party, but no action had been taken by the end of 1985.
 On December 8, Kuwait's State Security Court concluded the
 trial of four Kuwaiti citizens who had been indicted on a
 variety of charges including membership in an organization
 whose goal was to overthrow the regime and distribution of
 
 
 1293
 KUWAIT
 subversive literature. One defendant was sentenced to two
 years at hard labor for criminal complicity. A second
 received a similar sentence for training in the use of
 weapons. Two other defendants were found not guilty of any
 the charges. According to Kuwait News Agency, the case
 involved a "group accused of publicizing doctrines aimed at
 undermining the State's basic system and instigating the
 overthrow of the regime.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution declares that "freedom of belief is
 absolute," but states further that its practice is not to
 'conflict with public policy or morals." Kuwait's state
 religion is Islam, and the Shari'a (Islamic law) is, according
 to the Constitution, "a main source of legislation." The
 ruling family and most prominent Kuwaiti families are Sunni
 Muslims. There is no official policy of discrimination
 against Shi'a Muslims, who constitute about one-third of
 Kuwait's citizenry, but they and members of Kuwait's tiny Arab
 Christian minority are seldom appointed to sensitive
 government positions. There are a number of expatriate
 Christian congregations in Kuwait and several churches. In
 recent years the Government has banned Christmas parties in
 the country's hotels and restaurants. Pressure from
 fundamentalist Islamic groups is the unstated reason for the
 restriction. Expatriate practitioners of Eastern religions,
 e.g., Hindus, Sikhs, and Buddhists, are not allowed to
 establish places of worship in Kuwait but may worship
 privately in their homes. Proselytizing of Muslims by
 non-Muslims is prohibited.
 In the past three years, the National Assembly has barred the
 future granting of citizenship to non-Muslims, prohibited all
 importation of alcoholic beverages, and repeatedly attempted
 to establish Islamic law as the basis for all legal process.
 Assembly members have also pressured, with some success, those
 campuses of Kuwait University which are sexually integrated to
 separate the sexes in the classrooms and in other facilities,
 such as cafeterias. The Government has accommodated the
 National Assembly's demands for the application of some
 fundamentalist principles but has blocked attempts in the
 Assembly to apply Islamic law across the board.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens generally are free to travel inside and outside the
 country, to emigrate, and to return. There is some
 restriction on foreign travel for young men who have not
 completed, or been exempted from, their compulsory military
 service. Those serving in the military must receive
 permission from the Defense Ministry before traveling abroad.
 Although there are no different legal standards regarding the
 internal or foreign travel or emigration of Kuwaiti women, in
 practice husbands can prevent their wives and minor children
 from leaving the country.
 There are occasional instances in which citizens' passports
 are suspended temporarily. Generally, this has applied mainly
 to criminal suspects, but sometimes to outspoken regime
 critics as well. By late 1985, upwards of 8,500 Kuwaitis were
 barred from traveling abroad because of debts remaining from
 the collapse of an extra-official stock market three years
 
 
 1294
 KUWAIT
 earlier. Representatives of societies, associations, and
 trade unions wishing to travel to and participate in
 international meetings have to receive prior permission.
 Although the Constitution states that "no Kuwaiti may be
 deported from Kuwait or prevented from returning thereto,"
 persons have been stripped of Kuwaiti citizenship and
 deported. Such actions have been rare and have in some cases
 been based on the voluntary acquisition by the person of
 foreign citizenship. One such incident publicly reported in
 1985 involved a person who purportedly obtained citizenship
 illegally. There have been unconfirmed rumors that several
 other persons also were stripped of citizenship and deported
 following the 1985 bombings.
 All non-Kuwaitis in Kuwait over the age of 21 must have the
 sponsorship of a Kuwaiti citizen. Kuwait does not extend
 permanent residence to its expatriate population, although in
 1985 the National Assembly debated the advisability of
 extending residence and property ownership privileges to
 expatriates. Employers have the power to restrict job
 mobility and the continued residence in Kuwait of their
 expatriate employees. Many expatriates (including some
 government employees, such as teachers) must surrender their
 travel documents to their employers, thus preventing them from
 leaving the country without the employer's consent. Those
 employed by government agencies are given residence visas
 which require an exit permit or "no objection" letter in order
 to leave the country. Non-Kuwaitis convicted of crimes are
 routinely deported after serving their sentences.
 Illegal entrants to Kuwait are normally returned to their home
 countries; exceptions have been made for those persons, mostly
 Iranians and Afghans, who are considered by the Government to
 be legitimate refugees and have been permitted to remain in
 Kuwait or sent to third countries. Most members of Kuwait's
 large Palestinian population have Lebanese or Jordanian travel
 documents. Since 1984, undocumented Palestinians, and those
 with Lebanese documentation, have received commitments from
 the Government that they will be allowed to stay even without
 sponsors, although Palestinian youths over 21 years of age who
 travel or study outside Kuwait often have difficulty rejoining
 their families in Kuwait.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Al-Sabah, a family of Bedouin origin, have ruled Kuwait
 for over 200 years. The 1962 Constitution limited succession
 to descendants of Mubarak the Great, the ruler at the turn of
 this century. In practice, the ruler and senior family
 members choose the Crown Prince from either the Al-Jaber or
 the Al-Salim branch of the Al-Sabah. Under the Constitution
 this choice is confirmed by majority vote of the National
 Assembly. Executive power is vested in the ruler and, under
 him, in an appointed Council of Ministers whose chairman by
 tradition is the Crown Prince.
 Upon independence, Kuwait inaugurated a National Assembly
 composed of 50 deputies, elected by secret ballot, plus
 cabinet members (presently 16, including the Prime Minister),
 sitting ex-officio. Candidates for the National Assembly are
 self-nominated; multiple candidates compete for the 50 seats.
 A "grandfather clause" effectively limits suffrage to adult
 
 
 1295
 KUWAIT
 males who resided in Kuwait before 1920 and maintained a
 residence there until 1959, and their descendants. Women's
 suffrage was considered and rejected by the National Assembly
 in 1982. A Kuwaiti women's organization was unsuccessful in
 1984, both in its attempts to register women to vote and to
 take the issue to the constitutional court. The issue is
 likely to be debated in future National Assembly sessions,
 particularly in light of an Islamic ruling in 1985 that women
 should not have the right to vote.
 The National Assembly reviews government policy and programs,
 including budgets, makes recommendations, and questions
 ministers on a variety of subjects, especially their
 ministries' responsiveness in public services. Government
 policy is criticized in the Assembly, which only rarely
 rejects government-proposed legislation, but which is capable
 of exerting sufficient pressure on the government to cause it
 to modify its legislation to satisfy Assembly desires.
 Constitutionally, the National Assembly can bring down the
 Government or force individual cabinet members to resign.
 Since the Prime Minister is by tradition also the Crown
 Prince, the Assembly has forced the entire cabinet to resign
 only once. Should the Assembly declare that it is unable to
 work with the Government, the Amir may dismiss the
 Government. He has the option, however, of dismissing the
 Assembly and calling new elections. As a result of debate in
 the 1985 Assembly, the Justice Minister, who was a member of
 the ruling family, resigned before a vote of confidence was
 taken against him.
 Informal contacts between rulers and ruled are an important
 feature of the Kuwaiti political system. Traditionally, adult
 male Kuwaitis have had relatively easy access to their tribal
 and religious leaders, the heads of the prominent merchant
 clans, and to the ruling family itself through the system of
 "diwaniyyas," informal discussion groups to which anyone can
 come and freely speak his mind. That custom has endured, as
 has the tradition that the Amir should govern in consultation
 with the other community leaders. High-ranking officials are
 also approachable through "wasta," the use of influential
 family members or acquaintances as intermediaries in obtaining
 favors or a more favorable hearing for one's case.
 While most male Kuwaiti citizens can participate directly or
 indirectly in the political process, noncitizens, who
 outnumber Kuwaitis by three to two, have no role. Kuwait has
 been reluctant to extend citizenship to those of non-Kuwaiti
 origin, with the exception of certain stateless Bedouin.
 Naturalization of even Kuwait-born persons is rare. This
 anomaly is particularly striking for the 300,000 Palestinians,
 the second largest segment of the population. Citizenship has
 been extended only to a few Palestinian families who made
 significant contributions to Kuwait before the early 1970's.
 The Government has established a committee to draw up criteria
 for granting citizenship but the results of its deliberations
 are not expected in the near future. Expatriates seldom
 engage in poldtical activities for fear of exposing themselves
 to possible deportation.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Amnesty International, in its 1985 report, expressed concern
 that during 1984 political prisoners were tried in camera with
 
 
 1296
 KUWAIT
 no right of appeal and that some of the hundreds of people
 deported from Kuwait could become prisoners of conscience and
 face torture or execution in their homelands. Freedom House
 calls Kuwait "partly free." There are no known current
 requests by nongovernmental organizations to examine human
 rights in Kuwait.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Kuwait's population of 1,710,000 is growing at the rate of 3.5
 percent a year. The Government has an extensive social
 welfare program to spread the benefits to all citizens of the
 extremely high per capita gross national product, estimated by
 the World Bank to have reached $17,880 in 1983. The
 distribution of this wealth is heavily skewed in favor of
 Kuwaitis.
 The major social distinction in Kuwait is between Kuwaiti
 nationals, who comprise only 40 percent of the population, and
 expatriates. Ownership of commercial establishments (above 49
 percent), real estate, and shares on the local stock market
 (the principal sources of private wealth in this capitalist
 economy) is open only to Kuwaitis. Kuwaiti labor laws give
 priority in employment to Kuwaitis, then Arabs, and lastly
 other foreigners. The current economic recession threatens
 the expatriate community by encouraging efforts to reduce the
 number of long-term resident non-Kuwaitis. Many have begun to
 look for employment outside Kuwait.
 Programs are designed to provide Kuwaitis with housing, family
 allowances, retirement income, medical care, education, and
 employment. Improved health care has resulted in a drop in
 the infant mortality rate to 20.5 per 1,000 live births and an
 increase in life expectancy for Kuwaitis, as of 1985, to 71.7
 years. Although exact figures are unavailable, few if any
 persons are below the absolute poverty level and malnutrition
 has been effectively eliminated. In 1980, the adult literacy
 rate for Kuwaitis was 67.5 percent.
 White collar and skilled expatriate workers often earn the
 same base pay as Kuwaitis, but receive less in fringe
 benefits. Benefits restricted to Kuwaiti citizens include
 higher government salaries, additional government stipends and
 social allowances, and, in general, retirement pensions.
 Resident expatriates are entitled to some medical benefits.
 Public schooling is offered, with some exceptions, only to
 children of expatriates who arrived in Kuwait prior to 1963,
 although the Government subsidizes tuition for students in a
 number of Arabic language elementary and secondary schools.
 Kuwaitis are given preference for admission to the University
 of Kuwait. Unskilled expatriate workers, however, earn much
 less money and usually are not permitted to bring their
 families to Kuwait. Some of these workers live in crowded
 apartments or work camps.
 General conditions of work are established by Kuwaiti labor
 law for both the public and private sector, with the oil
 industry treated separately. The law limits the work week to
 48 hours, provides for a minimum of 14 days leave per year,
 establishes a compensation schedule for industrial accidents,
 and establishes a minimum age of 18 years for full-time work,
 or 14 years for part-time work. Women are permitted to work
 except in "dangerous industries and trades harmful to the
 health," and are promised "equal remuneration to that of a man
 
 
 1297
 KUWAIT
 provided she does the same work." There is no legal minimum
 wage, but this has little impact in practice since Kuwait is
 not a low-wage country. Reflecting the importance of the
 petroleum industry in Kuwait, the law governing employment in
 this sector is more generous than the general laws. It
 provides for a 40-hour workweek, overtime pay for shift work,
 30 days annual leave, and a generous sick leave policy.
 There are two ministerial orders that supplement the above
 laws. Number 14 (1970) established an interministerial board
 to resolve labor disputes and Number 42 (1979) created a
 permanent commission to coordinate activities in the field of
 public health and occupational safety.
 Kuwaiti women are allotted a subordinate role by statute and
 practice. Denied the vote, women are also limited by
 tradition from freely choosing their role in the society,
 though less so than in some other Islamic countries.
 Nevertheless, there are Kuwaiti women who are outspoken in
 their demand for a broader role in society. In contrast to
 the practice in some neighboring countries, a Kuwaiti woman is
 permitted to drive a car, may wear Western dress in public,
 and has legal access to higher education inside and outside
 the country. Although women have yet to join the work force
 in large numbers, they are able to compete for government and
 corporate employment and have the right to litigate against
 men (for example, in child custody suits). Many women have
 accumulated substantial personal wealth. However, the
 Government has restricted women from being assigned abroad in
 Kuwait's diplomatic service. Some prominent, educated women
 also are wary of current fundamentalist trends which they fear
 may lead the Government to restrict their freedoms as a price
 for fundamentalist restraint on other issues.
