 REPUBLIC OF MALDIVES
 The Republic of Maldives is a parliamentary democracy headed
 by a strong president.   In practice, government control in
 this small, homogeneous society is exercised by a small elite
 with a common background and outlook, whose authority is
 generally and traditionally accepted by the population. There
 are no political parties, and candidates for the unicameral
 legislature, the Majlis, run for office as individuals. The
 Majlis selects a single nominee for president, who is
 subsequently approved or rejected by the voters. In September
 President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom was reelected to a third term,
 following his unanimous nomination by the Majlis and a
 subsequent approval rate in the public referendum of more than
 95 percent.
 Until recently, the Maldives had not been subject to attack or
 invasion from outside for hundreds of years, and thus saw no
 need for a large defense establishment. The country's
 800-1,000 strong National Security Service is responsible for
 maintaining internal law and order, protecting the President,
 defending the country, and preventing foreign fishermen from
 encroaching on Maldivian fishing grounds. The police division
 of the Service investigates crimes, makes arrests, and
 enforces house arrest.
 The Maldives is a nation of 1,200 islands in 19 atolls
 scattered across an area 500 miles long by 75 miles wide in
 the Indian Ocean. The isolation of individual island
 communities from each other, and of the Republic as a whole
 from the rest of the world, is a dominant feature of social
 and economic life. It is one of the world's least developed
 countries, with nearly half the population engaged in
 traditional activities such as fishing, harvesting and
 processing of coconuts, and small-scale farming.
 The Maldives was rocked November 3 when mercenaries
 (apparently Sri Lankan nationals) came ashore at Male and
 attempted to overthrow the Government of President Gayoom.
 Timely military intervention by the Government of India
 thwarted the coup attempt. The armed intruders inflicted
 damage in Male and deaths among both Maldivian security forces
 and civilians. Speculation on those behind the putsch attempt
 centered on expatriate Maldivians. Dozens of mercenaries as
 well as at least one Maldivian allegedly associated with the
 coup attempt were captured. In the immediate aftermath of the
 putsch attempt, it was unclear how the Government of the
 Maldives would handle their trials and possible punishment.
 There was no significant change in the human rights situation
 during 1988. Virtually universal adherence to Islam, the
 innate conservatism of a traditional society, and the high
 degree of homogeneity of the Maldivian people all underlie the
 relative absence of pressures for social and political
 change. The authority of the small ruling elite is widely
 accepted, and open dissent is rare.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings.

 REPUBLIC OF MALDIVES
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The 1968 Constitution prohibits torture.
 Maldivians follow Shari'a or Islamic Law. Occasionally,
 convicted criminals are flogged. Usually, however, punishment
 is confined to fines, payment of compensation, house arrest,
 imprisonment, or banishment to a sparsely populated island
 where the prisoner must work to earn his daily keep.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution requires that "no person shall be apprehended
 or arrested, except on a verdict specified by Shari'a or
 (civil) law." There is no provision under Maldivian law for
 preventive detention, and incommunicado detention is rare.
 Acting on information or complaints received, the Attorney
 General's office passes legal cases to the appropriate court,
 and the judge instructs the police to undertake an
 investigation. The suspect is questioned at police
 headquarters and may, depending upon the charges, be detained
 or placed under house arrest for 15 days while the case is
 investigated. If the case is not brought to trial within 15
 days, the suspect is freed. Detention or house arrest may be
 extended after the first 15 days by authority of the
 President, but usually for not more than 1 month. There are
 no provisions for bail, but a defendant held without bail who
 has valid reason to travel may receive permission to do so
 from the court handling his case.
 Actions which "arouse the people against the Government" are
 illegal, and persons can be arrested and charged with
 violation of this law, the penalty for which can be banishment
 to remote atolls of the Maldives. With regard to forced or
 compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There is a High Court and eight lesser courts in the capital
 at Male, each dealing with specific types of cases (e.g.,
 debt, theft, property claims). On other islands, there are
 courts that deal with all types of cases. Judges are trained
 in Islamic law, are appointed by the President and serve at
 his pleasure, and thus cannot be considered fully
 independent. Cases in island courts that present knotty legal
 points are referred to the- appropriate specialized court at'
 Male, whose judge may in turn refer the legal point to four
 judges attached to the Justice Ministry for assistance. The
 High Court acts as a court of appeal and handles politically
 sensitive cases.
 During trial, the accused may defend himself and call
 witnesses. He also may be assisted by a lawyer, but they are
 few and are not provided by the courts. The accused is
 sentenced by the judge. The length and type of sentence are
 established by law and custom.
 There are no Maldivians serving sentences for political
 crimes.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits the opening, intercepting, reading,
 or making public of letters, telephone conversations,
 telegrams, and wireless messages exchanged between persons
 "except in accordance with the specific provisions of the
 law." There is no evidence that the Government monitors
 correspondence or telephone conversatiorrs or uses a system of
 informers. The Constitution also requires that private
 premises and dwellings be respected. There have been no
 reports of practices to the contrary.
 There are no prohibitions on the importation of foreign
 publications, except pornography, and foreign broadcasts are
 not jammed.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and expression
 "so long as the specific provisions of Shari'a and the law are
 not contravened." Any citizen may criticize or complain to
 the Government without fear if he does so through recognized
 channels, such as letters or oral complaints to the President,
 to a Majlis member, or to a civil servant or other person in
 authority.
 Maldivians are frequently frank in private when discussing and
 criticizing the Government. However, the law which prohibits
 arousing opposition to the legally established government,
 together with a long tradition of authoritarian rule, tend to
 make Maldivians careful when expressing their opinions to
 foreigners or in the media. There is no prior censorship of
 newspapers, but because writers and editors are subject to
 prosecution if their articles contravene the law,
 self-censorship is a well-engrained practice. No writers or
 editors were prosecuted for writing articles alleged to have
 created antigovernment feelings. There are three privately
 owned newspapers, each required to register with the
 Government. The only government-owned publication is the News
 Bulletin, published by the Maldivian Department of Information
 and Broadcasting.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution assures freedom of assembly and association,
 but Maldivians make little use of these freedoms in a
 political sense. The majority of rallies and meetings are
 sponsored or approved by the Government and commonly are
 addressed by officials or religious leaders. Clubs and other
 private associations, of which there are many, are permitted
 to function if they do not contravene Shari'a and civil law,
 provided that they register with the Government. For a
 discussion of freedom of association as it applies to labor
 unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution affirms Islam as the official religion, and
 all citizens are Muslims. There are no churches or shrines
 for the practice of any other religion. Missionaries of
 non-Muslim faiths are not permitted to proselytize.
 Conversion of a Muslim to any other faith would be a violation
 
 
 1429
 REPUBLIC OF MALDIVES
 of the Shari'a, the law of the land, and would automatically
 result in the loss of citizenship. Links with coreligionists
 in other countries are allowed, and a delegation from the
 Maldives performs the hajj each year.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government discourages Maldivians from changing islands of
 residence, primarily because most recent migrants have moved
 to Male, which is becoming severely overcrowded. The
 Government reimposed regulations in 1982 that limit
 immigration to the capital-island and its surrounding atoll,
 permitting migration to Male only for short periods for work,
 education, or medical treatment.
 There are no restrictions on foreign travel or on emigration.
 There are no exit visas. The Government requires any
 Maldivian who has acquired another nationality to maintain
 Maldivian nationality concurrently. Such a person must enter
 and leave the Maldives on a Maldivian passport. As far as is
 known, the Government never has revoked the citizenship of any
 Maldivian. There are no refugees or displaced persons, and so
 far as is knowi, no Maldivians have been exiled or are
 refugees or displaced persons elsewhere.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The people of the Maldives have only. limited and indirect
 influence on the selection and organization of their
 government. Although the Majlis is elected by universal
 suffrage, the President is nominated by the Majlis, and the
 Maldivian citizens vote only in a presidential referendum
 designed to approve or reject the one candidate. President
 Maumoon Abdul Gayoom rules the Maldives together with a small
 group of generally well-educated members of the elite who are
 loyal to him. There are no political parties. Although they
 are not forbidden by law, President Gayoom has publicly
 discouraged their formation as being inappropriate to the
 homogeneous nature of Maldivian society.
 Members of the unicameral legislature, the Mailis, are chosen
 for 5-year terms by means of secret ballots cast by all
 Maldivians over 21 years of age. Candidates, for the Majlis
 must be over 25 years of age, Muslim, able to read and write
 both Arabic and Maldivian script, must not have been involved
 in a crime for the past 5 years, and must be in good mental
 and physical condition. Of 49 members, 40 are elected (2 from
 each atoll and 2 from Male), and a are appointed by the
 President. Members of the Majlis are freely approached by
 citizens or groups with grievances or points of view on
 proposed legislation.
 Candidates for President must be Sunni Muslim, born of
 Maldivian parents, male, and over 30 years old. They must not
 have been convicted of any crimes and must be mentally
 stable. The single nominee for President is chosen by secret
 ballot in the Majlis from as many candidates as are proposed
 by the members. The nomination is confirmed or rejected in a
 nationwide referendum, also by secret ballot. In 1988 the
 Majlis voted unanimously to nominate Gayoom to a third 5-year
 term, and he was confirmed with 95.62 percent of the votes in
 a referendum in September.

 REPUBLIC OF MALDIVES
 Since there are no political parties, factions in the Majlis
 tend to coalesce around individuals or points of view and vary
 according to the issue. Any member may introduce legislation,
 which, if seconded, must be considered and approved or
 disapproved by the Majlis. The Majlis has the power to
 question ministers and to call for their removal. In
 practice, however, the Majlis generally supports the
 Government after discussing and sometimes amending its
 proposals.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no requests for outside investigations of human
 rights violations. There are no local human rights
 organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 By Islamic and Maldivian tradition, women play a
 modest--though growing--role in public life. In 1988 the
 first woman was elected--as opposed to appointed by the
 President--to the Majlis. There are three women in the
 Citizens' Special Majlis that is reviewing the Constitution.
 Women hold several responsible positions in the Civil Service
 and now number over 20 percent of all government employees.
 The President has appointed 2 women as aides, another to be
 his Director of Social Affairs, and 2 women to his 12-member
 Consultative Committee. In late 1988, the Government opened
 the National Security Service to female applicants.
 Islamic practice is the basis for Maldivian civil law.  It is
 therefore easier for husbands to divorce wives than vice
 versa. Islamic law, or Shari'a, also governs inheritance.
 Most women, like most men, are not part of the cash economy;
 those who do work for wages--for the Government, in businesses
 on Male, or in garment factories--generally receive similar
 wages.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 There are no trade unions in the Maldives, and neither the
 right to form them nor the right to strike is recognized.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively are not
 recognized or protected by statute.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There is no minimum age for the employment of young people.
 The Government has set no restrictions on conditions under
 which children or young people may be employed, although most
 employers do not hire young people for work at night or in
 what are considered hazardous conditions.

 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Until the mid-1970's, most Maldivians either were
 self-employed or held government jobs, and there was a
 relative lack of interest in workers' rights or organization.
 However, during the past 6 years, three sizable garment
 manufacturing facilities have been opened, employing large
 numbers of workers. There were no special provisions
 regarding workers' rights or treatment in the agreements to
 establish these companies between the Government and the
 foreign investors. However, a Department of Labor was formed
 in 1982 and an intergovernmental Labor Advisory Board which
 met in 1987 drafted the country's first labor laws. These
 pertain to hours of work, overtime pay, and provisions for
 annual leave.
 There is no national minimum wage, although the Government has
 established wage floors for certain kinds of work. The usual
 workweek is 6 days. Employees who work more than an 8-hour
 day are entitled to be paid overtime, and employers are
 required to provide a certain minimum number of holidays per
 year, under new laws adopted in 19-87.
