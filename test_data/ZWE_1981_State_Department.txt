 ZIMBABWE
 The Zimbabwe Government, led by Prime Minister Robert
 Mugabe and his Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU-PF)
 party came to power in April, 1980, after a transition
 period under British supervision. The one-man-one-vote
 elections, contested by nine parties, were the first held
 under the constitution agreed to at Lancaster House by
 Mugabe, his Patriotic Front co-leader Joshua Nkomo and
 a delegation led by Bishop Abel Muzorewa, representing
 the Zimbabwe-Rhodesian *internal settlement' government.
 The latter took over in 1979 from Ian SmitX's all-white
 administration which had not been recognized by the
 international community during its 14 years of existence.
 Mugabe's party won 57 of the eighty black seats in
 parliament, formed a government coalition with Nkomo's
 Patriotic Front party (ZAPU-PF) with 20 seats. The
 coalition sits together in parliament with three parlia-
 mentarians of Muzorewa's UANC Party and the joint 20
 Republican (formerly Rhodesian) Front Party members who
 had won the 'reserved* white-seats in a separate election.
 There is. however, no alliance between the government, the
 UANC and Rhodesian Front members.
 The new government inherited a country with Western legal
 and political traditions, a highly-developed economic
 infrastructure and strong cultural, social, legal and
 religious institutions. The government affirmed its
 socialist ideology, but set out to build on and develop
 the existing system as the best way to extend economic
 benefits to the poor majority. Prime Minister Mugabe and
 members of his government emphasized racial, tribal and
 political reconciliation and the need for whites to stay
 in Zimbabwe. Be also promised scrupulous observance of
 the rights guaranteed by the constitution agreed on at
 Lancaster House (hereinafter called the constitution).
 He also assured whites that jobs and property would be
 secure. The predominantly white civil service and
 judiciary were retained, with qualified blacks promoted
 or hired to fill vacancies which occurred. The new
 government granted amnesty to 11,000 prisoners, reduced
 the regressive sales tax, eliminated tax on food staples,
 set the first national minimum wages of $110 per month
 for industrial and commercial workers, began a land reform
 program and voted funds to allow free primary education
 and free health care for the vast majority of the
 population.
 The Mugabe government has alleged that it is threatened
 by South Africa and that domestic political opponents
 are wittingly or unwittingly aiding South African
 efforts to destabilize Zimbabwe, politically and
 economically. The Emergency Powers Act, a wartime
 measure allowing suspension of political and civil
 liberties, has been extended until January, 1982. The
 principal extra-constitutional power exercised by the
 government has been the ability to detain people deemed
 security threats, subject to judicial review.
 The Zimbabwe government charged that the August 1981,
 murder at his Salisbury home of Joe Gqabi, an official
 of the African National Congress of South Africa, was
 carried out by agents of the South African Government
 (possibly former members of the Rhodesian Army now
 in the South African Defense Forces.) No one has been
 arrested in the case.

 Vigilante activity has subsided markedly in Zimbabwe
 during 1981, and unauthorized violence is no longer a
 serious national problem as it was during the few months
 following Robert Mugabe's victory.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The constitution states "no person shall be subjected to
 torture or to inhuman or degrading punishment or other
 such treatment". There have been no accusations of
 torture or of cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment by
 the Zimbabwe Government.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The 1981 Amnesty International report expressed concern
 that the independence government had retained the death
 penalty. However, there were no reports of summary
 executions or severe physical punishments administered
 as sentences for crimes in 1981.The twenty men facing the
 death penalty on April 18, 1981, Zimbabwe's first an-
 niversary of independence, had their sentences commuted
 through presidential clemency.
 Prison conditions are spartan but not unusually harsh.
 Diet, clothing and exercise are governed by regulations;
 and deprivation of necessities is not used as a dis-
 ciplinary measure. Living conditions are sometimes
 crowded, with as many as one hundred prisoners sharing
 one large room. More than 60 percent of black prisoners
 now sleep on beds--virtually none did before independence.
 The diet of all prisoners has been raised to that served
 the white prisoners at independence. Some 85 percent of
 the senior officers in the prison service are now black.
 Many prisoners are required to do manual or farm labor at
 prison facilities.
 c. Disappearances
 There is no pattern of abductions, secret arrests or
 detentions. A small number of abductions by political
 factions have been the subject of criminal prosecution
 and conviction with sentences handed down.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There have been no allegations of arbitrary arrest or
 imprisonment. The constitution guarantees that no person
 shall be arrested or detained except by court order or
 "reasonable suspicion of his having committed or being
 about to commit a criminal offense." Exact figures on the
 number of the people detained under the Emergency Powers
 Act are not available because of the government's refusal
 to divulge this information. Ten ZAPU members were
 detained on political grounds early in 1981, but sub-
 sequently released. Suspects are informed of the charges
 against them "as soon as reasonably practicable" after
 arrest or detention and are entitled to compensation for
 unlawful arrest or detention.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The constitution outlines rights of defendants in the
 Zimbabwe court system. The accused is guaranteed a "fair
 hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and
 impartial court," the presumption of innocence, the right
 
 
 319
 to counsel of his choice, clear and detailed charges, the
 right of cross-examination of witnesses, the right of
 appeal, freedom from double jeopardy and the right to.
 refuse to testify at his own trial.
 The constitution requires that all trials and verdicts
 be public, except where the interests of justice, the
 national interest or the private lives of people involved
 would be unnecessarily prejudiced. In practice, there
 has been no denial of fair public trial in Zimbabwe,
 though a shortage of judicial officials has resulted in a
 minor backlog of court cases. When ZANU leader and then
 manpower minister Edgar Tekere was arrested in 1980 on
 a murder charge, the government allowed the judicial
 process to take its course and intervened neither for
 nor against Tekere. He was ultimately released by the
 court under the terms of the now repealed Indemnity and
 Compensation Act, which had been passed in 1975 to protect
 government officials of the Smith regime during the war.
 The government subsequently repealed the Act.
 A new system of primary courts-was introduced during 1981.
 More than 800 village courts, dealing.with minor civil
 cases and misdemeanors, were established. At the next
 higher level, community courts, the 50 presiding officers
 were trained through a US Government grant from the Human
 Rights Fund for Africa, which also financed the universi-
 ty training of the first large group of black magistrates.
 The new structure has virtually eliminated the problem of
 illegal political tribunals which took justice into their
 own hands during and immediately after the war.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution protects citizens from arbitrary search
 or entry. Entry without a warrant is permitted when
 Wreasonably justifiable" in the interests of "defense,
 public safety, public order, public health or town and
 country planning", when authorized by law. There have
 been no allegations of abuse of this authority by govern-
 ment officials in Zimbabwe.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Includingi
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution guarantees freedom of religion, assembly
 and association. The previous government's direct censor-
 ship of the print media was terminated, though media
 self-censorship means in practice that news reporting
 often-coincides with the official line. Books, films
 and periodicals considered pornographic or excessively
 violent are prohibited.Grounds for banning or prohibition
 were narrowed in July 1980 to exclude political censorship.
 The Zimbabwe government purchased from South African
 interests the major shareholding in the corporation owning
 the country's five major newspapers. The government's
 interests are represented by a non-political mass media
 trust, and the press has remained financially and editori-
 ally free from direct government control. All previous
 editors, however, have been removed and replaced by persons
 whose editorial policy is uniformly pro-governoment. Some
 
 
 320
 parliamentary and other criticism unfavorable to the govern-
 ment is reported, but there are numerous allegations that
 other stories which may reflect poorly on the current
 leadership are suppressed. The government radio and tele-
 vision generally base programming on government press re-
 leases and official versions of events. The government
 has appointed officials to the broadcast media who can be
 counted on to promote coverage favorable to its ideology
 and policy. ZAPU has complained about the predominance
 of coverage given ZANU-PF on radio and television.
 Joshua Nkomo's newspaper has discontinued publication, al-
 though it was not forced to do so. The imbalance in radio
 and television coverage has, if anything, grown during 1981.
 There has been no interference with intellectuals or
 academic work, and expression of contrasting points of
 view at the university and at government-sanctioned
 seminars and conferences has been encouraged.
 There are restrictions on peaceful public assembly.
 Persons who intend to hold public political meetings must
 obtain the prior approval of the ministry of home affairs.
 The ministry recently denied permission for the staging of
 a Muzorewa sponsored rally to be held in Bulawayo but gave
 its approval to ZANU-PF and ZAPU, partners in the govern7
 ment coalition, to hold political meetings in Bulawayo on
 the same day.
 The Industrial Conciliation Act prohibits both spontaneous
 strikes and lockouts, requiring instead that parties must
 first negotiate disputes and refer them to arbitration
 by a court if various bodies created by that law cannot
 get the parties to agree.
 If a union rejects the final arbitration decision, it may,
 after a 30-day cooling off period, signal its intention
 to strike. Since independence, labor disputes have never
 reached that stage. No one has been prosecuted under the
 Industrial Conciliation Act for striking, despite a number
 of walkouts in 1980-81. Strikes have accd their
 purpose of highlighting grievances and achieving wage and
 benefit increases. It has been government policy to take
 no action against these labor actions. However, when ap-
 proximately 1,000 nurses and teachers recently staged a
 three-day protest over pay disparities, the minister of
 education summarily fired a representative group of
 teachers who attempted to hold discussions with him. The
 prime minister and the press also came out against the
 strikers who finally returned to work after being assured
 by the government that their salary grievances would be
 considered.
 An umbrella labor body was formed in 1981, which is
 trying to consolidate what it calls "splinter" unions.
 There has been no legal limit on the existing freedom
 of labor groups to organize independently. A plethora
 of voluntary associations and professional organizations
 operate with no restrictions by the government.
 Religious freedom is strictly upheld. Over 100 Christian
 denominations and Jewish and Muslim congregations practice
 freely in Zimbabwe. Criticism of organized religion is
 also allowed.
 
 
 321
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of international and foreign travel, emigration,
 and immunity from expatriation are guaranteed by the con-
 stitution. Foreign exchange restrictions limiting the
 amount of currency and household effects a traveler or
 emigrant can take out of the country have been stiffened
 in 1981. The government maintains a list of prohibited
 immigrants, but-all names put on the list by the previous
 government for political reasons have been removed, and
 over 100,000 Zimbabweans who had left the country during
 the unilateral declaration of independence period have been
 repatriated. The government encouraged white citizens to
 stay in Zimbabwe, and has appealed to citizens living
 abroad to return.
 The right of voluntary repatriation has been abridged
 in only one instance, that of Lt. General Peter Walls.
 He was legally excluded under the Emergency Powers Act
 because he had made remarks to the press in South Africa
 criticizing the government, questioning its legitimacy
 and predicting civil war, after resigning as commander
 of the government's force integration excercise. Approxi-
 mately 100 South Africans have sought and been granted
 political refuge in Zimbabwe since 1980.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The February 1980 election which brought Robert Mugabe
 and his ZAiNU-PF Party to power was held under UK adminis-
 tration with Commonwealth observers on a one-man, one-vote
 basis, cent participation. Nine parties
 contested the election, and all were given free media time
 and held campaign rallies. Most of those parties continue
 to exist, as do the Republican Front, the leading white
 party, and other white political groups. Party politics,
 switches of allegiance and the fortunes of various leaders
 are topics of animated conversation and media coverage
 throughout Zimbabwe.
 The government, however, is becoming increasingly intolerant
 of the opposition. A decree has been issued requiring
 that all political meetings and proposed speakers be cleared
 with the minister of home affairs seven days in advance,
 resulting in the prohibition of some planned opposition
 gatherings. Prime Minister Mugabe has denounced opposition
 politicians Abel Muzorewa and Ian Smith as promoting and
 condoning subversion. He also warned that the government's
 policy of reconciliation with former opponents, while still
 a cornerstone of official thinking, will be applied only to
 those who are willing to reciprocate and accept that
 Zimbabwe should be changed essentially along the lines of
 the government's program. Prime Minister Mugabe has said
 that he favors creation of a one-party state. He has re-
 peatedly stated, however, that he will only move in this
 direction. if he receives a popular mandate to do so.
 Local government elections were held in 1980-1981 in cities
 and rural areas. The vote split largely along ethnic
 lines, with ZANU victorious in Shona areas while ZAPU won
 in Matabeleland. Urban elections were by secret ballot and
 hotly contested. In many rural areas, local candidates ran
 unopposed.
 
 
 Parliamentary debate is lively and frank. Opposition
 criticism, daily questioning of government ministers
 and points raised in legislative debate often influence
 government action and public perceptions of the govern-
 ment. Both black and white parliamentarians take their
 role as elected representatives seriously, frequently
 traveling to their constituentcies and bringing up local
 and national grievances in the parliament.
 The constitution establishes an independent ombudsman with
 power to investigate any government administrative act
 alleged by a citizen to be unjust. This office has not yet
 been filled.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 Investigations for alleged violations of human rights
 by the new Government of Zimbabwe have not been sought
 by any international or non-governmental organization.
 Amnesty International is concerned over the government's
 retention of the death penalty and its failure to reject
 formally a policy introduced in 1976 which permitted
 secret executions, as well as the Emergency Powers Act
 provision for detention without charges.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Because the government has yet to make calculations on
 social indicators such as infant mortality, life expectancy
 and adult literacy, the only available ss on these
 indicators are 1976-79 World Bank figures. Since independ-
 ence, the government has taken important steps to improve
 the living standards of Zimbabwe's seven million blacks by
 developing plans for reducing substantial inequality
 between blacks and whites. Thus far the government has
 raised minimum wages and has begun a deliberate program of
 Africanization. It has also expanded education to the
 poor and has cared for and resettled approximately
 1,000,000 war refugees.
 Zimbabwe's GNP rose from $310 in 1970 to $530 in 1979.
 There are, in effect, two Zimbabwean economies--the wage
 economy and the subsistence economy--and the median income
 for whites is nearly ten times that for blacks. Thus,
 while overall per capita income in 1979 was $530, per
 capita income in the wage economy which employs 40 percent
 of the labor force was approximately $1,260. In the sub-
 sistence economy this figure was approximately $44. A
 strong economic performance during 1980 allowed the GNP
 to grow to $686.
 Life expectancy at birth for both male and female rose
 from 51.5 years in 1973 to 55 years in 1979. The end
 of the civil war and the government's efforts to provide
 greater health care services to all Zimbabweans should
 continue to gradually expand life expectancy.
 The only available infant mortality statistics date back
 to 1960 and show a rate of 129 deaths per 1,000 live
 births. This figure was estimated to be as high as 220
 per thousand in the rural sector. This is because of the
 generally poor sanitary conditions in the rural areas,
 which prior to independence, were exacerbated by the lack
 of adequate health facilities and trained medical personnel.
 
 
 323
 
 The overall population growth rate for 1960-69 was 3.9
 percent per annum and the total fertility rate for 1970
 was 6.6 percent. The growth rate for blacks is estimated
 to be 3.6 percent per annum. The figure for whites is
 declining and difficult to measure accurately due to
 emigration. Zimbabwe's present growth rate is one of the
 highest in Africa. If the present trend continues the
 population could reach 15 million by 2,000 A.D. One of
 the immediate results of the growth rate--the creation
 of 150,000 new job seekers per annum--can only exacerbate
 an already critical unemployment problem.
 Zimbabwe's pre-independence education system was largely
 determined by the interests of the dominant white minority
 rather than by any other consideration. The foundation
 for racial segregation and discrimination was directly
 related to early ordinances which established clear guide-
 lines for the education of the whites while leaving the
 education of the blacks exclusively in the hands of
 Christian missionaries. At the outset these missionaries
 dispensed minimal education intended only to qualify the
 student for a predetermined subordinate role in the white-
 dominated society. Although black children have long had
 access to primary educationthrough these mission schools,
 many families were unable to pay the required fees and
 there were often not enough locally available primary
 school places. A recent UNESCO estimate puts total primary
 school enrollment iwe at 97 percent. According
 to AID statistics 725,00 black children attended primary
 schools in 1972, of whom 45 percent were females. In 1979
 this figure had only increased to 819,000. By the 1980
 school year, with the advent of free primary education
 and the return to normalcy in the rural areas, primary
 school enrollment among black children increased to over
 1,250,000. The 1962 figure for overall adult literacy
 was 39 percent. A 1981 estimate puts the figure at 40
 percent.
 According to World Bank figures the average number of
 persons housed per room in the urban areas decreased
 slightly from 0.8 percent in 1960 to 0.7 percent in 1970.
 No statistics are available for the rural sector and
 there is no breakdown by ethnic group. Black housing
 in the urban areas remains primarily the responsibility
 of local and central government. Urban squatters are
 estimated to number 70,000, the majority concentrated in
 the main urban areas, Salisbury in particular. Approxi-
 mately 25 percent of Salisbury's squatters are second
 generation urban dwellers. An additional estimated 45
 percent have lived there for 10 years or more. The majori-
 ty of the adult population in the squatter settlements are
 between the ages of 25 and 35 years with families of three
 to four children.
 According to World Bank and Food and Agriculture
 Organization statistics the ratio rose from 96 percent in
 1970 to 100 percent in 1977. Nutritional status, like
 health status, also varies. According to AID reports some
 wage laborers on large farms receive rations as wages. The
 foodstuffs distributed are generally maize, meal, beans and
 salt. While some farmers supply adequate rations of
 protein--meat and/or ground nuts--others give none.
 Available data on poor rural and urban dwellers are both
 scanty and contradictory. The last complete census in
 Zimbabwe was conducted in 1969, and there are no recent
 studies which provide information on socio-economic status
 by ethnic group or geographic region.
