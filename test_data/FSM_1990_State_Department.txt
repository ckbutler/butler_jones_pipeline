 FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA
 The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is a nation of 607
 islands, mostly uninhabited, extending over 1 million square
 miles of ocean in the Central Pacific. Four states, Chuuk
 (formerly Truk), Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap comprise the
 federation. The four states were part of the Trust Territory
 of the Pacific Islands, administered by the United States from
 1947 to 1986 pursuant to an agreement with the United
 Nations. In November 1986, the FSM emerged as a sovereign,
 self-governing nation under the Compact of Free Association
 with the United States. The population, of Micronesian
 origin, is estimated to exceed 100,000.
 Political legitimacy rests on the popular will expressed by a
 majority vote in accordance with the Constitution, which is
 based in large part on the U.S. model. There are three
 branches of government: a president as chief executive and
 head of state, a unicameral legislature elected from the four
 constituent states, and a judicial system that applies
 criminal and civil laws and procedures closely paralleling
 those in the United States.
 Under the Compact of Free Association, the United States is
 responsible for defense and national security. The FSM has no
 security forces of its own aside from local police and other
 law enforcement officers, all of whom are firmly under the
 control of the civil authorities.
 The economy depends heavily on transfer payments from the
 United States, fishing, tourism, and subsistence agriculture.
 No human rights abuses were reported in 1990. However,
 traditional customs sustain a value system which discriminates
 between people on the basis of social status and sex.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The law prohibits such-arbitrary interference, and in practice
 there is none.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These rights are constitutionally assured and faithfully
 observed. Each of the four state governments controls a radio
 station, broadcasting primarily in the local language. Yap
 also controls a small television station. The Federal
 Government and the Governors of Kosrae and Chuuk publish
 newsletters. )Several private and municipal newsletters in
 Chuuk and Pohnpei, however, do not hesitate to challenge
 governmental policies. Religious groups operate private radio
 stations in Pohnpei and Chuuk, and a commercial television
 station broadcasts 12 hours a day on Pohnpei.
 -b.t- Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Bill- of Rights guarantees freedom of peaceful assembly and
 association, and these.rights are honored in practice. During
 political campaigns, citizens often question candidates at
 public meetings. Formal associations are uncommon in
 Micronesia. Nevertheless, student.organizations and at least
 one lobbying group exist.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Federated States is extremely hospitable to diverse
 religions., and missionaries of many faiths work within the
 nation. The Bill of Rights forbids establishment of a state
 religion and governmental restrictions on freedom of
 religion. Most of the citizens are Christians.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within. the Country, Foreign
 Travel,.Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions in any of these areas. The Compact
 of Free Association permits citizens to travel to, reside in,
 and work in the United States without having to obtain
 immigrant visas.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rightsr The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Congress is elected by popular vote from each state;
 Congress then chooses the President and Vice President from
 its ranks by majority vote. State governors, state
 legislators, and municipal governments are all elected by
 direct popular vote. Elections are conducted honestly, and
 political campaigning is unrestricted. Although there are no
 restrictions on the formation of political groups, to date
 there have been no efforts to form political parties.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No violations have ever been alleged, nor are there any known
 requests for investigations. No local groups concern

 themselves with human rights. The Federated States does not
 belong to the United Nations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides explicit protection against
 discrimination based on race, sex, language, or religion. The
 various traditional cultures establish hierarchies of social
 status, and these traditional rankings can influence access to
 political office and education, even though such access is in
 principle open to all. Traditional culture is greatly
 respected by the peoples of the Federated States, and is
 protected by Article V of the Constitution. Although the
 traditional social orders are losing ground as westernization
 takes a greater hold upon young people, male dominance is a
 fact of life throughout Micronesia.
 Women are still at the early stages of finding jobs beyond the
 entry level in both the public and private sectors.
 Allegations of violence against women are almost exclusively
 concerned with domestic conflict between husband and wife.
 Assault is a criminal offense, but in such cases wives are
 reluctant to bring formal charges against their husbands.
 While the police and judges will pursue a case if there are
 formal charges, the general attitude is that such issues are
 best left to the extended family unit to resolve. Local
 support groups are beginning to hold meetings in some of the
 state capitals to publicize domestic issues, including alcohol
 and drug abuse. These meetings serve to create a greater
 awareness of social problems, including the rights of all
 citizens.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Citizens have the right to form or join associations, and
 national government employees by law may form associations to
 "present their views" to the Government. There are as yet,
 however, no trade unions in this largely nonindustrial society.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no law dealing specifically with trade unions or with
 the right to collective bargaining. There are no special
 economic areas set aside, and labor standards and practices
 are the same throughout the islands.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution specifically prohibits involuntary servitude,
 and there is no evidence of its practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There is no law establishing a minimum age for employment of
 children. In practice, there is no employment of children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The minimum wage for national government employees is $1.50
 per hour. While there is no legally established minimum wage
 for other types of employment, wages for unskilled workers
 vary from $0.80 to $1.50 per hour under current customs and

 FEDERATED STATES'OF MICRONESIA
 practices. These wages are sufficient to provide an
 acceptable standard of living under local conditions. There
 are-no laws regulating hoursof work or prescribing standards
 of occupational safety and health, but a federal regulation
 requires that employers provide a safe place of employment.
