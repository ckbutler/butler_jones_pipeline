 BURMA
 Burma is ruled by a highly authoritarian, military regime that has been con-
 demned for its serious human rights abuses. Heading the latest version of a military
 dictatorship that has presided over the country with an unyielding grip for more
 than three decades is the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), which
 took power in September 1988 after harshly suppressing massive prodemocracy
 demonstrations. Longtime dictator General Ne Win, whose policies had pushed
 Burma to the margins of the international community and driven the country into
 a deep economic decline, resigned shortly before SLORC's emergence. Nevertheless,
 he continued to wield the power behind the scenes.
 The SLORC, headed by the armed forces commander and composed of senior mili-
 tary officers, permitted a relatively free election in 1990. However, it failed to honor
 the results-which were an overwhelming rejection of military rule-or to cede
 power to the victorious party headed by prodemocracy movement leaders. Instead,
 the SLORC attacked the coalition of winning political parties through detentions,
 house arrests, and intimidation.
 Since General Than Shwe became Chief of State in April 1992, the SLORC has
 taken some modest steps to lessen its harsh rule, including reopening the univer-
 sities and releasing over 2,000 political prisoners. In January 1993, the SLORC in-
 augurated a national convention to begin work on a new constitution. However,
 SLORC officials stage-managed the proceedings and overrode even limited opposi-
 tion, interrogating and harassing delegates who attempted to deviate from the re-
 gime's position, and even sentenced one prodemocracy delegate to 20 years in prison
 for distributing information critical of the convention proceedings. It seems clear
 that the SLORC's domination of the convention, which has no mandate from the
 people, is to ensure adoption of a constitutional blueprint effectively guaranteeing
 the military's continued hold on power.
 The Government reinforces its rule via a pervasive security apparatus led by the
 Directorate of Defense Services Intelligence (DDSI) and the National Intelligence
 Bureau (NIB). Control is buttressed by restrictions on contact with foreigners; sur-
 veillance of government employees and private citizens; and arrests, detentions, har-
 assment, intimidation, and mistreatment of political activists. The Government jus-
 tifies its security measures as necessary to maintain order and national unity, al-
 
 
 587
 though several longstanding insurgent groups have reached accommodations with
 the SLORC in recent years and the others pose little threat to major population cen-
 ters.
 Burma is primarily an agricultural country, although it also has substantial min-
 eral, fishing, and timber resources. After Ne Win's 26-year rule reduced southeast
 Asia's richest land to a U.N.-designated "least developed country," the SLORC aban-
 doned the "Burmese Way to Socialism" in 1988, opening up the economy to permit
 private sector expansion and attract investment and badly needed foreign exchange,
 which has resulted in a limited improvement in the economy. The Government has
 hindered development of the private sector, however, by failing to address fun-
 damental problems: restrictions on private commerce; constantly changing rules and
 regulations; overcentralized decision making; a bloated bureaucracy; a greatly over-
 valued currency; poor civilian infrastructure; and grossly disproportionate military
 spending.
 There was no marked increase in the level of human rights abuses in 1993, in
 large measure because the SLORC had already been so successful in intimidating
 the Burmese people. At the same time, Burmese authorities took only limited steps
 to correct longstanding, serious human rights violations. The Government's use of
 forced labor-especially as porters for the army-as well as forced resettlement of
 civilians continued, causing hundreds of deaths due to disease, harsh treatment,
 and overwork. Five hundred or more Burmese remained in prison for political rea-
 sons, including more than 40 parliamentarians elected in 1990; approximately
 200,000 Rohingyas (Burmese Muslims from Arakan State) remained in refugee
 camps in Bangladesh; a few thousand students and dissidents continued as exes
 in Thailand; and roughly 71,000 Burmese live in ethnic minority camps in Thailand
 near the Burma border.
 Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi remained under house arrest, her fifth year
 of detention by the SLORC, without being charged or having access to legal proceed-
 ings. The SLORC persisted in denying basic freedom of seech and assembly, and
 arbitrary intrusions into private life remained pervasive. In a closed trial, in Octo-
 ber, the regime sentenced 12 dissidents, including one of the delegates to the Na-
 tional Convention, to 20 years in prison for distributing anti-SLORC information.
 The SLORC ignored a comprehensive resolution on Burma adopted by consensus
 in 1993 at the U.N. Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) calling for an end to
 human rights violations in Burma, the unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi
 and all other political prisoners, and the implementation of the 1990 elections.
 On the positive side, the SLORC commuted all death sentences handed down
 since it took power; released over 700 persons believed to be political prisoners; per-
 mitted the first-ever meetings between political prisoners and foreign visitors; and
 allowed additional family visits to Aung San Suu Kyi. Over 50,000 Rohingyas re-
 turned to Arakan State in 1993, and the Government signed a Memorandum of Un-
 derstanding in November with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
 providing for a presence in Arakan State to monitor the repatriation and
 reintegration of Rohingyas from Bangladesh.
 Nonetheless, on balance, in view of the persistent abuses by the SLORC, including
 its use of forced labor, its wholesale denial of basic political rights, and blatant ma-
 nipulation of the national convention, Burma must continue to be judged a serious
 violator of international human rights norms. The expressions of deep concern by
 the international community about the human rights situation in Burma in succes-
 sive resolutions adopted since 1991 by the UNHCR and the U.N. General Assembly
 have failed thus far to have an appreciable impact on the SLORC's behavior.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Although secret, extrajudicial
 killings reportedly were carried out in recent years, there were no such reports in
 1993. As in the past, credible sources reported many deaths among those impressed
 for forced labor projects and porterage.
 There were no confirmed incidents of summary executions of civilians in 1993. In
 late February, U Win Ko, a deputy-elect of the National League for Democracy
 (NLD) and finance minister in the oposition National Coalition Government of the
 Union of Burma (NCGUB), was murdered in Kunming, China. Burmese authorities
 have denied any involvement, and independent sources suggest other parties were
 responsible. U Hla Pe, who served as the NCGUB's Minister of Education and
 Health and Minister of Information, was murdered in Bangkok in mid-June. There
 is, however, no evidence as to the perpetrators.
 
 
 588
 b. Disappearance.-The number of disappearances in 1993 was probably little
 changed from the previous year, but accurate estimates are impossible since the
 Government will not provide information on these cases. Family and friends assume
 that those who have disappeared are under detention or have died in jail. Family
 members can generally determine that relatives have been arrested, but the process
 of obtaining information can take a long time. Some who disappeared were later re-
 ported as arrested. Others may have dropped out of sight or quietly attempted to
 leave the country for fear of arrest.
 Authorities rarely responded to inquiries from families concerning the where-
 abouts and welfare of disappeared or jailed relatives. The few replies routinely con-
 sisted of only general statements that such people were arrested for violations of
 existing laws.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Fragmentary evidence documents that mistreatment of political detainees continued
 to take place in Burmese prisons and detention centers operated by the security
 services. There has been a decline in the number of detentions, during which the
 worst abuse reportedly occurs. Political detainees are held incommunicado, with
 family or lawyers unable to visit during what can be a protracted pretrial period.
 The most common forms of maltreatment during this period were sleep and food
 deprivation coupled with round-the-clock interrogation.
 In recent years severe beatings and forcing prisoners to squat or assume unnatu-
 ral positions for fengthy periods have also been reported, and techniques designed
 to intimidate and disorient prisoners prior to interrogation have been routine. Such
 practices as electrical shocks to the genitals, suffocation, and cigarette burns have
 also been reported in the past, but there were no confirmed reports of these prac-
 tices in 1993.
 During 1993 there were no reports alleging torture of convicted political prisoners
 or deaths linked to the conditions of their imprisonment. Khin Maung Myint of the
 leftist People's Progressive Party (PPP) died in prison in 1993, apparently of natural
 causes after repeated stays in a prison medical facility despite his fami y's request
 for his transfer to a civilian hospital. Interviews by U.S. citizens and Congressional
 visitors on private travel with SLORC-selected prisoners at Insein prison near Ran-
 soon indicate an overly harsh prison regimen, i.e., little exercise, no reading or writ-
 ing materials for many if not most prisoners, poor nutrition, years of solitary con-
 finement for some, and illness induced by sleeping on concrete cell floors. Student
 leader Min Ko Naing, who met with two visiting American Congressmen at Insein
 Prison in August, displayed the effects of serious physical and psychological abuse.
 A few prominent prisoners, such as former NLD Cairmen Tin Oo and Kyi Maung,
 were provided limited reading material and bungalow accommodations. Those inter-
 viewed acknowledged receiving medicine as wefl as supplemental food brought by
 their families during 15-minute visits permitted every 2 weeks.
 The Government continued to bar the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) from visiting detainees or convicted prisoners of any kind.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrest and detention are prac-
 ticed routinely by the SLORC. Throughout the year at least scores of political activ-
 ists were detained for low-level political protests, such as handing out opposition fly-
 ers, painting political graffiti, or shouting opposition slogans. Some detentions coin-
 cided with the startup of sessions of the national convention or with various political
 anniversaries. Shortly after the January 9 launching of the national convention, for
 example, the authorities announced the arrest of 23 activists including Nay Lin, a
 youth organizer for the Federation of Trade Unions of Burma, who allegedly painted
 graffiti on a Rangoon wharf. Some students were picked up for staging a brief dem-
 onstration on June 7 at a suburban campus of Rangoon University. Several NLD
 members, including at least one successful candidate in the 1990 election, were de-
 tained after taking part in a wreath-laying ceremony at Aung San's tomb. Between
 June and August, the authorities also arrested 12 persons, including the writer Ma
 Thida and the successful NLD candidate and delegate to the national convention,
 Dr. Aung Khin Sint, for distributing opposition literature. In what was widely recog-
 nized as a warning to others, all were convicted in mid-October and given harsh 20-
 year prison sentences.
 While most detainees were members of political parties or engaged in overtly  -
 litical activities, businessmen and other private citizens were also subject to arbi-
 trary detention, particularly as the increase in private economic activity in 1993 led
 to additional scrutiny of businesses by security forces.
 The military again extended the house arrest of former NLD General Secretary
 and Nobel Peace Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. The decision was taken under the
 provisions of the Law to Safeguard the State from the Dangers of Subversive Ele-
 ments-also the basis for her initial year of house arrest which began in 1989. As
 
 
 589
 amended in August 1991, the law authorizes 1-year extensions of arbitrary deten-
 tion without charge or trial for up to 5 years. Aung San Suu Kyi has never been
 formally charged. The authorities have offered her an opportunity to substitute for-
 eign exile for her current house arrest, but she declinec-to leave the country. The
 military Government agsin allowed her husband and two sons to visit her in 1993.
 The authorities refu sea proposed visit by a group of fellow Nobel Laureates seek-
 ing her release.
 There is no prevision in Burmese law for judicial determination of the legality of
 detention. Bair may be granted by civilian courts in some circumstances. The num-
 ber of political detainees not sentenced by year's end was impossible to determine
 accurately.
 e. Denial of Fair Public ThiaL-Throughout 1993 the Government continued to
 rule by decree and was not bound by any constitutional previsions guaranteeing fair
 public trials or any other rights. Until abolished in September 1992, military tribu-
 nals exercised jurisdiction over all cases involving defiance of orders issued by the
 SLORC or local commanders. These tribunals cou d mete out only three sentences-
 the death penalty, life imprisonment, 3 years or more imprisonment with labor-
 regardless of existing laws. On January 1, however, a government decree codified
 an existing moratorium on capital punishment by commuting all previous SLORC-
 imposed death sentences to life imprisonment. It also capped all other prison terms
 at 10 years for anyone convicted during the SLORC era.
 After denying for years that it held any political prisoners, in April 1992, the Gov-
 ernment announced its intention to free those persons "detained politically" who did
 not represent a threat to state security. Between that time andthe end of 1993,
 the SLORC announced the release of more than 2,000 persons, although fewer than
 200 were publicly identified. The failure to identify most released persons invites
 suspicions about whether they were actually political prisoners, but opposition activ-
 ists believe this was generally the case. Re isMle sources indicate that some of those
 released in 1993 were monks imprisoned for participating in 1988 prodemocracy ral-
 lies and a 1990 boycott action, including prominent Rangoon Abbot Thu Mingala;
 prodemocracy businessman Ye Htoon; and numerous Karens and others suspected
 of supporting the 1991 Irrawaddy Delta insurgency.
 The 1992 decree also implicitly acknowledged that political prisoners had been
 held not only in Rangoon's Insein Prison but also in over 20 upcountry locations--
 many of which were still believed to hold some political prisoners at the end of 1993.
 The remaining political prisoners included former military officers Tin Oo and Kyi
 Maung, both of whom had served as chainnen of the NLD, comedian Zargana, stu-
 dent leader Min Ko Naing, and lawyer U Nay Min.
 Since September 1992, civil courts have handled civil and criminal cases, as well
 as politica trials. Civilian courts have reportedly become fairer in handling non-
 political cases since 1988, but remain plagued by corruption, inordinate delays in
 processing cases and appeals, and poor training and unprofessional behavior on the
 part of some court officers.
 Some basic due process rights, including the right to a public trial and to be rep-
 resented by a defense attorney, are generally respected by civilian judges. Judges
 are appointed by the Supreme Court with the approval of the SLORC (which also
 names justices to the Supreme Court). At present, judges must be at least law offi-
 cers with legal training. Defense attorneys are permitted to call and cress-examine
 witnesses, but their primary purpose is to bargain with the judge to obtain the
 shorest possible sentence for their clients. Cases, almost all political, which are tried
 in courtooms in prison compounds are not open to the public. In such cases, while
 defendants may have access to a defense attorney, counsel appears to serve no pur-
 pose other than to provide moral support. Reliable reports indicate that in political
 cases due process is largely ignored and verdicts manipulated.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 State continued to intrude extensively into the lives of private citizens during 1993.
 Forced entry and warrantless, unannounced searches of private homes were often
 conducted. Through its extensive intelligence network, the Government closely mon-
 itored the travel, whereabouts, and activities of many Burmese, particularly those
 known to be politically active. Security personnel selectively monitored private cor-
 respondence and telephone calls. Contacts or communications involving foreigners
 were subject to especially intense scrutiny, and government employees were re-
 quired to obtain advance permission before meeting with foreigners. Despite some
 efforts by the Government to improve its image by meeting in October with the head
 of the British Broadcasting Corporation Far Eastern Service, official propaganda
 continued in 1993 to take aim at various foreign news services and private citizens
 were generally unable to subscribe directly to foreign publications. Two inter-
 national newsmagazines were distributed through official channels and were avail-
 
 
 590
 able to the public at large, but censors occasionally banned issues or deleted articles
 criticizing local conditions or reporting opposition activities. Foreign radio broad-
 casts remained aprime source of information for the people and even for the mili-
 tary, despite the Government's hostility to this news source. The authorities sought
 to register the growing number of television satellite receivers but appeared ready
 to tolerate their use. Some foreign journalists, including television crews, continued
 to be granted access to the country, but their movements and contacts were closely
 monitored.
 In its most intensive and egregious infringement of privacy rights, the Govern-
 ment continued its program of forced resettlement, involving an estimated half-mil-
 lion urban residents throughout Burma since 1989. While most of those forced to
 move were described as "squatters," some people had been living in and paying rent
 on their former home sites for many years and had constructed permanent houses.
 The Government has made people move, almost totally at their own expense, to
 "new towns" which are far from their previous residences. "New town" occupants
 often live on former rice paddy land, subject to flooding in the rainy season, without
 adequate transportation, medical facilities, shelter, or sanitation. In 1993 conditions
 at some resettlement sites improved, but, according to international observers, such
 improvements were often unable to keep pace with the rate of new arrivals. Some
 outside experts accept the Government's explanation that the resettlement program
 serves legitimate long-term urban planning objectives, but they do not endorse the
 forceful methods used to move people.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-The Burmese Army has battled diverse insurgencies for more than four dec-
 ades in conflicts that have resulted in widespread human rights violations, including
 mistreatment and killing of prisoners, rape, neglect of the sick and wounded im-
 pressment of civilians for porter duty, and indiscriminate attacks on civilians. While
 the Government was responsible for the bulk of these abuses (the Burmese armed
 forces nearly doubled the number of combat units since 1988), insurgent groups
 have also violated humanitarian principles. Insurgent groups, such as the aren,
 Mon, and Karenni, continued to engage in small-scale fighting, mostly in remote
 areas, to try to gain greater autonomy from the dominant ethnic Burman majority.
 Some receive limited outside support from private international humanitarian and
 religious organizations. The Shan United Army (SUA) also claims to be fighting for
 greater autonomy but engages primarily in drug trafficking. Several former insur-
 gent groups with which the Government now has cease-fire accommodations like-
 wise are important narcotics trafficking organizations. The continued suspension of
 large-scale military offensives against insurgents in Karen state and elsewhere, to-
 gether with ongoing government efforts to reach a peace accord with the Kachin
 Independence Army (KIA), sharply reduced the level of fighting during 1993.
 In 1993 the use of forced porterage continued, with attendant casualties. Most of
 these deaths, roughly estimated to be in the hundreds, were from disease and over-
 work, though reports of mistreatment and rape were also common. The Burmese
 military also continued to use corvee labor and prison labor in combat areas. There
 were unconfirmed reports, for example, that on at least two occasions a combined
 total of as many as 700 inmates from a prison near Rangoon were taken to work
 as porters in eastern Burma. Credible reports from multiple sources indicated that
 porters have carried ammunition, supplies, and the wounded under the harshest
 conditions. Other well-placed sources also note that they are subject to hostile fire
 as well as maltreatment at the hands of Burmese soldiers. When porters are wound-
 ed, ill, or unable to continue their work, some have been reportedly left unattended
 to die. At the end of their service survivors often have had to find their own means
 to return home. It was also credibly reported that some members of the military
 used sham threats of impressment to extort money from villagers.
 Forced rural resettlement displaced ethnic minority villagers in Karen and Ka ah
 states and contributed to an increase of about 6,000 Burmese in camps on the Thai
 side of the border. Local sources reported some amelioration of conditions following
 the completion of the railroad to Loikaw for Catholic villagers in Kayah State who
 had been resettled in March 1992, and that many returned to their original homes.
 Reports from Karen State suggest rural relocation schemes continued to play a key
 role in the Government's counterinsurgency strategy.
 Despite this evidence that the Burmese authorities were not prepared fully to im-
 plement their obligations under the Geneva Conventions, in April and November the
 Government for the first time permitted the International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) to conduct two short seminars on humanitarian law for groups of mili-
 tary officers.
 Antigovernment groups were responsible for violence causing civilian and military
 deaths, including reported killings of civilians during attacks on villages and am-
 
 
 bushes or mining of transportation routes. In two separate incidents in February
 and March, over 100 confirmed civilian deaths resulted from military conflicts in-
 volving the narcotics-trafficking Shan United Army. Credible reports indicate
 Karenni insurgents executed at least eight captured Burmese soldiers, and civilian
 deaths in a transport train blown up by a land mine were attributed to Mon activ-
 ists. Additionally, reliable multiple sources indicated that Karen insurgents resorted
 to forced labor for porterage andimpressed youths into military service.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.--Severe restrictions on freedom of speech and the
 press persisted throughout 1993. Although the degree of enforcement varied, the
 Government generally continued to demonstrate little tolerance for opposing views
 or criticism. Private citizens remained reluctant to express opinions for fear of gov-
 ernment informers. The U.N. Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) Special
 Rapporteur deplored the *pervasive atmosphere of fear and repression" in Burma
 in his report adopted by the UNHRC in March. The Government exercised strict
 censorship of all news and publications produced in the country.
 Nevertheless, private magazines found it possible to publish articles on once taboo
 economic subjects, and some former political prisoners were allowed to publish on
 nonsensitive topics. The government-controlled press and broadcast services contin-
 ued to publish some limited criticism and satire in 1993. The Government adopted
 a tolerant approach toward the increasing activities of the United States Informa-
 tion Service in Rangoon, permitting it to distribute publications and organize discus-
 sions which treated themes involving human rights and fundamental freedoms. The
 authorities' actions in attempting to register private satellites dishes and impose
 fines on the many Burmese who had set up unauthorized satellite television receiv-
 ers slowed the spread of access to uncensored television news and other program-
 ming from abroad. No seizures of satellite receivers, however, were reported in 1993.
 The Government made heavy use of its monopoly of television and radio to pursue
 its political policies and, with the exception of coverage of some aspects of the na-
 tional convention, did not accord air time to opposing views. The same was true of
 all newspapers-two national dailies in Burmese and one in English, as well as
 daily papers published by the Rangoon city government and the Central (Mandalay
 area) Military Command. A revamping and renaming of the country's main daily
 in April resulted in increased publication of locally edited international wire service
 news, but that paper, as well as other newspapers, remained staunchly official or-
 gans, with military officials appointing editors and vetting editorials. Especially for
 domestic news, journalists had to hew to strict publishing and broadcast guidelines.
 All forms of media-domestic and imported books and periodicals, stage plays, mo-
 tion pictures, and musical recordings-were officially controlled and censored. Per-
 sons working in these fields admitted to exercising self-censorship lest they run
 afoul of the authorities.
 University teachers and professors remained subject to the same restrictions on
 freedom of speech, political activities, and publications as other government employ-
 ees. These included warnings against criticism of the Government; instructions not
 to discuss politics while at work; and strictures against joining or supporting politi-
 cal parties, engaging in political activity, and meeting foreign officials. While all
 teachers remained subject to dismissal for political disloyalty, some left the profes-
 sion voluntarily to escape the political pressure.
 The universities, closed for several years after the 1988 disturbances, were open
 for most of 1993. However, they were closed from December 1992 until mid-Feb-
 ruary in what many believe was a move to avoid student demonstrations during the
 startup of the politically sensitive national convention. Meanwhile, on the main
 campus of Rangoon University, fences built around the various faculties prior to the
 university's reopening remained in place, reportedly to help control potential stu-
 dent unrest. In a move also widely believed intended primarily to disperse and iso-
 late students, a fifth national university opened outside Rangoon in November.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government does not re-
 spect the right to freedom of peaceful assembly. A prohibition on outdoor assemblies
 of more than five people was unevenly enforced, but political demonstrations were
 strictly banned.
 Political parties were required to request permission from the authorities even to
 hold internal meetings of their own membership. The military's intimidation gen-
 erally served to discourage pu'lic expressions of antigovernment sentiments. In the
 few reported instances of unauthorized political activity, security forces generally in-
 tervened swiftly to detain or imprison participants in unauthorized meetings and to
 halt distribution of antigovernment leaflets. The authorities reportedly were quick
 
 
 to deploy a large-scale force in Mandalay in September when a spontaneous dem-
 onstration unexpectedly took on political overtones.
 The right of association existed only for those organizations, including trade asso-
 ciations and professional bodies, permitted by law and duly registered with the Gov-
 ernment. Moreover, the Government severely restricted the activities of even these
 organizations. Ten political parties remained formally legal at the end of 1993-
 down from 75 at the beginning of 1992-but they were virtually paralyzed through
 arrests, intimidation and surveillance. In February the authorities permitted a
 large private funeral to be organized for the wife of one-time oppositionist and
 former Prime Minister U Nu. While the Government denied visas to two sons living
 abroad, it permitted a daughter active in the Burmese opposition in India to attend.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is provided for in law. Despite the
 privileged position of Buddhists in government service this right is widely observed
 in practice although there have been human rights abuses against some believers.
 Buddhist pagodas, Muslim mosques, and Christian churches operate openly with
 minimal interference, at least in those areas of central Burma accessible to inde-
 pendent observers. Christians, Muslims, and animists are particularly numerous
 among minority ethnic groups. While generally allowing these groups to practice
 freely, security services monitor the activities of religious communities. The Govern-
 ment requires all religious organizations to register and subjects religious publica-
 tions to the same control and censorship imposed on secular ones. Restrictions on
 unauthorized religious groups remained in force, and the military continued to mon-
 itor activities in and around Buddhist monasteries and pagodas. The SLORC has
 been largely successful in halting political activism among the Buddhist clergy.
 Religious groups can and did establish links with coreligionists in other countries,
 although such links were reportedly monitored by the Government. The Catholic
 Church, for example, maintained ties to the Vatican. While foreign religious rep-
 resentatives were usually allowed only to obtain visas for short stays, in some cases
 they were permitted to preach to Burmese congregations. Though permanent mis-
 sionary establishments have not been permitted since the 1960's, some foreign
 Catholic nuns and at least one priest continued to reside upcountry, most working
 in homes for the aged.
 As part of its large-scale "urban development" program in recent years the Gov-
 ernment has taken control of several Christian and Muslim properties tiroughout
 Burma, including cemeteries. On the other hand, school authorities in Rangoon
 eventually exempted Muslim students from bowing to their teachers, when those
 students complained the action resembled a practice used in Buddhist worship.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Although Burmese citizens have the legal right to live anywhere in the
 country, both urban and rural residents have been subject to arbitrary relocation.
 Except for limitations in areas of insurgent activity, Burmese citizens could travel
 freely within the country but had to inform local authorities of their temporary
 place of residence. People staying overnight with friends or relatives within their
 home cities or villages were also required to report this to the authorities.
 People who failed to report either guests or intentions to stay overnight to the au-
 thorities were theoretically subject to a jail term, and arrests were occasionally
 made. Noncitizen residents, including ethnic Indians and Chinese born in Burma
 who hold foreigners' registration cards, had to obtain prior permission to travel.
 Though travel strictures continued to ease, the Government maintained controls
 on departure from the country. While the authorities simplified certain require-
 ments for obtaining a passport, other requirements plus bureaucratic procedures
 and corruption stillpresented formidable hurdles. Those traveling abroad to work,
 however, encountered fewer difficulties, particularly as Burmese authorities sought
 to increase hard currency earnings from the taxes they impose on such persons'
 earnings. Emigrants, by contrast, were required to reimburse the Government for
 "educational expenses" before receiving exit permission and were severely limited in
 what they could take with them.
 Burmese citizens who left legally were generally allowed to return to visit rel-
 atives, and those wishing to extend their stays found it easier to obtain permission
 to do so. Even some who had stayed abroad illegally and acquired foreign citizenship
 found it easier to return to visit or do business. In a move widely believed to be
 intended to encourage wealthy older overseas Burmese to retire in Burma, the Gov-
 ernment announced in May that Burmese abroad would have 2 years to reapply for
 citizenship lost through naturalization in another country. At about the same time,
 the Ministry of Home Affairs announced that Burmese abroad holding expired trav-
 el documents could obtain new passports or an extension of their old ones.
 Obtaining these benefits, however, remained subject to government approval on
 a case-by-case basis. Moreover, some Burmese living abroad, particularly those who
 
 
 593
 had traveled or remained abroad illegally, continued to fear subjecting themselves
 to potential punitive action by Burmese authorities if they should return to Burma.
 By September, 14 persons had been allowed to resettle in Burma, and another 14
 had had their Burmese passports extended or replaced.
 In 1993 foreigners were allowed into the country in increasing numbers on an in-
 dividual, rather than only on a tour group, basis. The authorities also took several
 steps to liberalize travel for foreigners within Burma, though large areas of the
 country remained off limits on security grounds. Tourist and family visit visas are
 routinely granted for 2 to 4 weeks, and can be extended on a case-by-case basis.
 However, select foreigners, such as human rights advocates and political figures,
 continued to be denied entry visas unless traveling under the aegis of a sponsor ac-
 ceptable to the Government. A private voluntary organization, Medecins Sans
 Frontieres/Holland, is now operating in Burma and has foreign personnel assigned
 to Rangoon on a permanent basis.
 In April 1992, following the flight into Bangladesh of an estimated 265,000 Mus-
 lims from Arakan State in order to escape military repression, the Governments of
 Bangladesh and Burma signed a Memorandum of Understanding providing for the
 voluntary repatriation of the refugees. However, Burma, unlike Bangladesh, did not
 accept a role for UNHCR in the repatriation process at that time. In the absence
 of an adequate international monitoring presence in Burma, most Rohingyas were
 reluctant to return to Arakan. After a private visit by High Commissioner Sadako
 Ogata to Burma in late July and subsequent talks between the Burmese authorities
 and UNHCR representativesthe Government of Burma signed a Memorandum of
 Understanding with the UNHCR in November which provides that the UNHCR will
 have a presence in Arakan State and will have access to all returnees. The agree-
 ment is intended to cover the monitoring and administration of the return to Burma
 in safety and dignity of about 200,000 Rohingyas who remain in refugee camps in
 Bangladesh. Of those who fled between late 1991 and mid-1992, some 50,000 were
 repatriated to Burma in 1993.
 Foreign refugees or displaced persons may not resettle or seek safe haven in
 Burma. The Government treats people claiming to be refugees as illegal immigrants
 and expels or imprisons them.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Burma is governed solely by the military, and the Burmese people do not have
 the right or the ability peacefully to change their government. Since 1988 active
 duty military officers have occupied many important positions throughout the bu-
 reaucracy, particularly at the policymaking level. Despite the appointment of sev-
 eral civilians to the Cabinet in 1992, military or recently retired military officers
 have continued to occupy most cabinet-level positions, numerous director general
 and subordinate posts, and key positions once held by technocrats in the economic
 ministries.
 In the 1990 election the NLD and associated parties achieved an overwhelming
 victory. The SLORC subsequently set aside the results and disqualified, detaine
 arrested, or drove into exile many successful candidates, including most of the NLD
 leadership. By the end of 1993, 174 of the 485 deputies elected had either been dis-
 qualified, resigned under pressure, gone into exile, been detained, or died. At least
 46 successful candidates from the election or prominent NLD activists were serving
 prison sentences. In 1992 the SLORC held discussions with selected representatives
 of the few political parties which had not been banned outright, with a view to stag-
 ing a national convention to write a new constitution without the participation of
 most leading members of the democratic opposition. The national convention finally
 opened on January 9 and continued intermittently throughout the year until Sep-
 tember 16, when it finally adjourned until the following January. Of the approxi-
 mately 700 delegates attending, only about 150 held mandates from the 1990 elec-
 tions. Members of six of the eight interest groups represented were selected by the
 SLORC. Using these groups as a majority, the Government forced through its own
 rules, its own agenda, and finally its own principles for a new constitution, guaran-
 teeing continued military control of the Government. During an intermediate stage,
 representatives of the NLD and minority groups were able to put forward some pro-
 posals clearly at odds with government preferences. But the authorities carefully
 controlled the level of visible opposition by censoring presentations, declaring unwel-
 come documents off-limits to the public, forbidding discussion from the floor, and in-
 timidating individual delegates behind the scenes. There has been no genuine public
 discussion of the process that will be used to arrive at a new constitution.

 One NLD victor in the 1990 election and national convention delegate, Dr. Aung
 Khin Sint, was convicted and sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment for distributing
 opposition literature to his fellow delegates.
 In some regions where government forces exercise limited or no control, including
 in cases where the Government has reached an accommodation with former insur-
 gent groups, indigenous populations have considerable autonomy in running their
 own political and economic affairs. Even in government-controlled areas, they gen-
 erally retain their social and cultural institutions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 No internal human rights organizations are allowed to exist. The Government
 continued to oppose outside scrutiny of its human rights record but permitted some-
 what greater access in 1993 for some journalists, nongovernmental organizations,
 and foreign government officials wishing to examine the country's human rights sit-
 uation. Burmese authorities allowed UNHRC Special Rapporteur Professor Yokota
 to conduct another fact-finding mission in the country in November 1993.
 In 1991, 1992, and again in 1993, the U.N. General Assembly (UNGA) adopted
 increasingly strong resolutions urging the Burmese Government to end human
 rights abuses and undertake genuine democratic reform. The 1993 UNGA resolution
 called on the Government to release unconditionally Aung San Suu Kyi and other
 detained political leaders and to respect the expressed will of the Burmese people
 by implementing the results of the 1990 elections.
 The UNHRC Special Rapporteur appointed in March 1992, Professor Yozo Yokota,
 visited Burma in December 1992 and presented his report in February 1993. He re-
 turned to Burma in November 1993 to fulfill his mandate as Special Rapporteur.
 The report offered a harsh catalog of human rights abuses in Burma and called for
 far-reaching remedial action. In later reviewing the report, the UNHRC took special
 aim at the refusal of Burmese authorities to accord Dr. Yokota the "full and unre-
 served cooperation" and access to persons of his choice that had been conditions of
 his mission. The Government, for its part, disputed the Special Rapporteur's man-
 date and rejected many of his findings.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Women in Burma in general have traditionally enjoyed a high status,
 exercising most of the same basic rights as men and taking an active role in busi-
 ness. Consistent with traditional culture, they keep their own names after marriage
 and often control family finances. However, participation of women remained low in
 the minuscule industrial sector and in the bureaucracy; a few professions, such as
 forestry and geology, are entirely barred to women. Women do not consistently re-
 ceive equal pay for equal work. There continued to be no women's rights organiza-
 tions in Burma or government agency specifically devoted to safeguarding women's
 interests.
 There was no nationwide pattern of violence directed specifically against women.
 However reliable reports continued to indicate that many Burmese women and chil-
 dren in the border areas were forced or lured into serving as prostitutes in Thailand
 by criminals and criminal organizations. Recruitment of these women generally oc-
 curred in remote areas where Burmese officials were unable to prevent the practice.
 In 1993, impressment, including of women, for military porterage duties continued,
 with attendant casualties.
 Although Burmese culturally view rape with great abhorrence, in 1993 there con-
 tinued to be a consistent pattern of reports alleging rapes of ethnic minority women
 in border areas by Burmese soldiers.
 Children.-In mid-July the Government issued a law stipulating children's rights
 and containing provisions covering their protection and custody, education, employ-
 ment and judicial treatment. Burmese authorities also adopted in September a "Na-
 tional Program of Action" for the survival, protection, and development of the coun-
 try's children. By year's end it remained unclear whether the Government intended
 to give the program the political impetus needed to ensure the interministerial co-
 operation and resource allocation required to make it a success.
 Government and UNICEF figures indicated the plight of children to be worse
 than was earlier realized. Infant mortality is high (94 per 1000); 37 percent of chil-
 dren under 3 are severely or moderately malnourished; 31 percent of children aged
 5 through 14 suffer from iodine deficiency; only 62 percent of children enroll in pri-
 mary school; and only 25 percent of children complete the prescribed 5-year course.
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-Burma's numerous ethnic minorities which
 have their own distinct cultures and languages, have been underrepresented in the
 
 
 595
 Government and largely excluded from the military leadership. Despite recently in.
 creased government investment in the border areas in road, hospital, and school
 construction, economic development among minorities continued to lag and many
 still live at the subsistence level.
 Since only people who can prove long familial links to Burma are accorded full
 citizenship, some people not of ethnic Burmese ancestry, primarily Indians and Chi-
 nese, continued to be denied full citizenship and to be excluded from government
 positions. Individuals without full citizenship are also barred from certain advanced
 university programs in medicine and technological fields and are often the object of
 prejudice. However, Indian and Chinese minorities continued to play an important
 role in the economy-a situation resented by many Burmans.
 In Arakan State, some Rohingyas, who in general do not enjoy full citizenship,
 have also have been denied national identity cards. Though a limited number of out-
 side observers were able to visit Arakan State, albeit on a government-controlled
 basis, credible reports continued to emerge of discrimination and travel restrictions
 for Muslims in the area. The well-documented human rights abuses which
 precipitated the original Rohingya exodus, however, appeared to have largely sub-
 sided. At the same time, claims that Buddhists from elsewhere in Arakan State
 were being resettled nearer the border in previously Muslim areas were reliably
 confirmed.
 Multiple, reliable sources indicated that the military occasionally required minor-
 ity populations in the border regions to provide without compensation vehicles,
 equipment, and lodging for soldiers.
 Religious Minorities.-The SLORC continued to associate itself closely with the
 majority Buddhist religion, giving wide publicity to the participation by its members
 in various Buddhist rites and ceremonies. While this reportedly was a cause of con-
 cern among some members of other religions, the Government in fact continued to
 permit members of the major non-Buddhist faiths to practice their religion. Reli-
 gious organizations, however, remained subject to registration and censorship con-
 trols applicable to the entire population. Restrictions on Muslims in Arakan State
 appear to be result primarily from their lack of full citizenship and to discrimination
 on ethnic grounds.
 People with Disabilities.-Official assistance to persons with disabilities is ex-
 tremely limited. There is no law mandating accessibility to government facilities for
 those with disabilities. A small number benefit from the services of the Mary Chap-
 man School for the Deaf in Rangoon, which recently began receiving government pa-
 tronage, or from modest religious-associated assistance programs funded through
 private donations. Most disabled persons, however, must rely on traditional family
 structures to provide for their welfare, and many become destitute. The principal
 exception is disabled members of the military, who receive medical attention, reha-
 bilitation, and financial assistance, though most veterans receive such benefits only
 for a few years after discharge. Reliable reports indicate that high-ranking officers
 receive better treatment than the rank and file. Since 1986 Burmese authorities
 have permitted representatives of the ICRC to work in Burma to upgrade provision
 of orthopedic prostheses. Because of both landmines and train-related accidents,
 Burma has one of the highest rates of amputees in the world.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-In 1993 there continued to be no right of association
 among workers in Burma. Workers were not free to form or join trade unions of
 their own choosing, and leaders of unofficial labor associations, such as youth orga-
 nizer Nay Lin of the Federation of Trade Unions of Burma, were subject to arrest.
 A new labor law was promised in connection with the drafting of a new constitution,
 but it is doubtful the document will ensure the right of workers to organize freely.
 At a minimum, any trade unions which might form are expected to be firmly under
 government control. Workers are not permitted to strike, and there were no re-
 ported instances in 1993 of attempts to do so.
 In July 1989, the United States suspended Burma's eligibility for trade conces-
 sions under the Generalized System of Preferences program, pending steps to afford
 its labor force internationally recognized worker rights. In 1990 the U.S. Govern-
 ment declined a formal request to reconsider the suspension.
 In June 1993, the International Labor Organization (ILO) Conference cited Burma
 in a "special paragraph', its strongest form of censure, for its longstanding failure
 to take "the necessary measures in legislation and practice to guarantee to all work-
 ers and all employers without any distinction and without prior authorization the
 right to organize even outside the existing trade union structure should they so
 wish."

 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers continued not to
 have the right to organize and bargain collectively. Government arbitration boards,
 which once theoretically provided a means for airing labor disputes, were abolished
 in 1988. The Government unilaterally sets wages in the public sector. In the private
 sector, wages are set by market forces. In a job-scarce economy, this means employ-
 ers determine wage levels. The Government pressures joint ventures not to pay sal-
 aries greater than those of ministers or other high-level employees. Joint ventures
 circumvent this via supplemental pay, including remuneration paid in foreign ex-
 change certificates, as well as through incentive and overtime pay and other fringe
 benefits. Foreign firms generally set wages near those of the domestic private sector
 but follow the practice of joint ventures in awarding supplemental wages and bene-
 fits.
 No special export processing zones exist.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Burma's legal code does not pro-
 hibit forced labor. The military routinely employed corvee labor on its myriad build-
 ing projects and, according to credible reports, officials accepted bribes to excuse
 some people from work. Forced labor was used in constructing the railroad line
 opened in 1993 to Loikaw, capital of Burma's Kayah State.
 The Burmese Army has for decades impressed civilian males to serve as porters.
 According to reliable reports, in 1993 the army continued to abduct youths off the
 streets, chiefly in minority areas but also in some urban areas of central Burma.
 Women were also occasionally impressed as porters, cooks, and laundresses for sol-
 diers in frontline areas, according to credible reports. Military authorities commonly
 permitted conscripts and their families to pay them money in lieu of porter duty.
 In June a Burmese diplomat in Singapore organized the confinement and forced
 return to Burma of a group of 11 Burmese seamen transiting Singapore en route
 from Australia to Thailand after the men prevailed in a wage dispute with the help
 of the International Transport Federation. All remained free in 1993 but are unable
 to regain employment abroad.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Children aged 13 to 15 may work
 4 hours a day. The "Child Law" of July 14, 1993, governs most matters concerning
 children under the age of 16. It gives each such child the right to "engage in work
 in accordance with law and its own volition." To date, the "law" referred to includes
 both the Factories Act of 1951 and the Children Pledging of Labor Act, this latter
 being an Indian law from 1933 still on the books. In theory, the penalty for employ-
 ers disregarding this regulation was 2 years in prison, but there were no reports
 of any prosecutions in 1993 for illegally employing children, despite the fact that,
 in cities, working children were highly visible. They were hired at lower pay rates
 than adults for the same kind of work, and economic pressure forced them to work
 not only for their survival but also to support their families. Burmese law requires
 children to attend school through the fourth standard, usually reached between the
 ages of 12 and 15. The Department of Basic Education estimated, however, that 38
 percent of children aged 5 to 9 never enroll in school. Of those who do, less than
 30 percent complete the fourth grade. Two-thirds of Burma's primary schoolchildren,
 principally in rural areas, leave school for economic reasons. In the higher grades,
 the drop-out rate for girls is double that for boys.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Depressed economic conditions and lack of at-
 tention by government authorities continued to dictate substandard conditions for
 workers. The Law on Fundamental Workers Rights of 1964 and the Factories Act
 of 1951 regulate working conditions. There is a legally prescribed 5-day, 35-hour
 workweek for employees in the public sector and a 6-day, 44-hour workweek for pri-
 vate and parastatal sector employees, with overtime paid for additional work. Work-
 ers have 21 paid holidays a year.
 Only government employees are protected by minimum wage provisions. The min-
 imum wage was raised in March to $3 per day (20 kyats) at the official exchange
 rate, but less than $0.20 at the unofficial, free market rate. The Government raised
 wages for public employees by 25 percent in March, but pay in the state sector re-
 mained far below the amount needed to provide a decent standard of living or
 counter the practice of taking bribes. The actual average wage rate for casual labor-
 ers in Rangoon was about twice the official minimum. Wages continued to lag far
 behind inflation.
 To protect health and safety at workplaces, there are numerous regulations per-
 taining to room size, ventilation, fire hazards, and the availability of latrines and
 drinking water. In practice, these were seldom enforced, particularly in the private
 sector.
