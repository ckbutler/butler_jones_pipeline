 LEBANON
 Lebanon traditionally has shown a high regard for human
 rights, but its ability to enforce respect for these
 rights has been seriously eroded in recent years by
 internecine warfare and the use of its territory by
 guerrilla and external military forces. This has re-
 duced greatly the area of the country under effective
 government control. Substantial parts of the country
 are controlled by the Syrian army, which has been in
 Lebanon since 1976 as an Arab League peace-keeping force,
 by Palestinian guerrilla groups, and by Lebanese militia
 forces of various politico/religious persuasions. Fight-
 ing among these forces has led to heavy civilian casual-
 ties, especially since 1975. Lebanese civilians also
 have lost lives and property as a result of Israeli
 military raids against Palestinian guerrilla forces
 located in Lebanon. Although Lebanon has been used as
 a base for Palestinian attacks into Israel, no signif-
 icant attacks have occurred in either direction since
 the July 24 cease-fire in southern Lebanon. There have
 been many abuses of human rights: intimidation, kidnap-
 pings, and summary executions are common. There are no
 official, reliable casualty figures for Lebanon. The
 following, which should be regarded as an order of
 magnitude rather than an exact count, breaks down the
 estimated number of people killed and wounded since
 1976.
 DEAD           INJURED
 1976                          60,000 (est.) 209,487
 1977                          14,442           6,099
 1979                           3,386           7,982
 1979                           1,788           1,662
 1980                           2,200           2,400
 1981                           2,379           6,518
 The general downward trend in casualties was reversed
 with the outbreak of heavy fighting in Zahlah and Beirut
 in 1981. The figures include victims of ordinary crime,
 as well as of violence. However, there are no clear-cut
 lines: some of the current violence can be attributed to
 criminal acts pursued under the cover of political action
 against a background of general lawlessness.
 The objectives of the government of Lebanon are to expand
 the areas under its authority and to establish the army
 as the ultimate guarantor of security, but government-
 controlled areas still constitute only a small part of the
 country. Although the regular court system and some police
 units have resumed operation in parts of the country not
 controlled by the central government, the de facto polit-
 ical and military authorities in place--whether Syrian,
 Palestinian or Lebanese militia--have the last word in the
 administration of justice.

 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Government authorities do not sanction torture, although
 charges of torture have been brought by at least one
 Lebanese religious group against the government's own
 security forces. The private militias and armed forces
 which operate outside the control of the central govern-
 ment, however, have tortured captured opponents in the
 past.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The treatment of prisoners varies according to the identity
 of the detaining authority. Arrests by the various non-
 governmental military authorities have involved rough
 treatment, and have resulted in summary executions on
 occasion. Interrogation by Lebanese police occasionally
 involves physical force, but not as an officially condoned
 practice. During the civil conflict of 1975-1976, many
 of the government's prisons were destroyed or severely
 damaged. As a result, prisons re-established since the
 war are seriously overcrowded. Many militia forces main-
 tain prisons of their own, and there is overcrowding in
 these prisons as well. In the government prisons,
 prisoners are allowed visits by relatives and attorneys.
 The diet is stark, but prisoners can acquire supplemental
 food from relatives or through purchases.
 c. Disappearances
 Disappearances following abduction, particularly of young
 men, are common occurrences in present-day Lebanon;
 responsibility generally is attributed to the various
 militia groups and non-Lebanese government armed forces.
 Multiple graves are found occasionally containing the
 unidentified victims of internecine fighting or group
 executions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Hundreds of arbitrary arrests have been carried out over
 the years by private armed elements. There are reportedly
 still several prisoners illegally held in various unoffi-
 cial prisons. The government itself does not hold any
 political prisoners. Under the Lebanese legal system, a
 judicial hearing is held, usually, shortly after an arrest.
 Because the government is unable to provide physical pro-
 tection to judges and prosecuting attorneys, it sometimes
 has found it difficult to enforce its decisions on arrests
 and imprisonment.
 
 
 1033
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Law, past practice, and custom afford the right to a fair
 trial by an independent judiciary. Judges can order closed
 sessions in cases which they believe might disturb public
 order or offend public morals. Defendants are made aware
 of the charges against them and have the right to counsel
 after initial interrogation by the police; this right is
 not always respected. Because of the collapse of the public
 security system, judges occasionally are unwilling to pass
 judgment or sentence for fear of personal reprisal. This,
 as well as a shortage of judges, can delay trials. The
 prisoner is always credited for time served, and no trial
 is delayed so long that the sentence would be less than the
 time served. Despite many vacant judgeships, the court
 system has gradually resumed operations in several parts
 of the country, including some areas under militia,
 Palestinian, or Syrian control. The number of criminal
 and civil trials held has correspondingly increased over
 the past few years, but this upward trend was interrupted
 early in 1981 by the heavy fighting which broke out in
 Beirut and Zahlah and lasted several months. The opera-
 tions of the judicial system stopped entirely irt those
 two cities. Furthermore, the fighting interrupted the
 gathering of statistics on administration of justice by
 the ministry of justice. (The ministry itself is located
 on the dividing line between the Muslim and Christian
 segments of the city, and during the fighting it was
 virtually closed down.)
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Article 14 of the Lebanese constitution provides that 'the
 domicile is inviolable. None can enter it except in cases
 provided by the law and according to the form it prescribes.*
 In theory, this means that Lebanese authorities must acquire
 the equivalent of a warrant to enter homes. Until the
 effectiveness of the Lebanese Internal Security Forces is
 restored, however, Lebanese homes will not be completely
 safe from intrusion. Various armed groups in de facto
 control have not always respected the inviolability of the
 home. In Beirut and other parts of Lebanon, empty homes
 have been taken over by squatters; Palestinian refugees
 and armed groups also have forcibly evicted legitimate
 owners and occupants.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Present legislation empowers the government to censor the
 press, but it is not being implemented. There are no
 government-owned newspapers, and the press freely criti-
 cizes the government. Censorship was lifted in 1980 from
 the 50 percent government-owned Beirut television station.
 Publications seldom print material objectionable to the
 
 
 1034
 political group in control in the area where they are
 based, and sometimes limit criticism of other political
 groups for fear of violent retribution. Most publications
 are distributed freely and are available even in areas
 hostile to their editorial viewpoints. Several clandestine
 radio stations operated by individual militia groups broad-
 cast without interference.
 In general, Lebanese can practice their religion freely;
 prior to the 1975-1976 fighting, accommodation among
 Lebanon's 14 recognized faiths was a cornerstone of the
 unwritten covenant establishing the Lebanese state. The
 recent civil conflict exacerbated underlying religious
 and political tensions. These tensions and sense of
 individual insecurity to some degree inhibit the public
 practice of Islam in some heavily Christian areas and vice
 versa. Freedom of association is subject to the same type
 of practical limitations; in Lebanon, a person's religious
 affiliation often assigns him to a particular political
 grouping in the eyes of others, whether warranted or not.
 Religious distinctions historically have been sharply
 drawn. They are embodied in arrangements which allocate
 governmental and military positions and parliamentary
 seats on the basis of religious affiliation. Religious
 courts have jurisdiction over matters of personal status:
 marriage, divorce, inheritance and guardianship. The
 customary law they apply often discriminates against women.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement within the country traditionally has been free,
 subject only to the practical consideration that large
 areas controlled by private militias or Palestinians
 could be unsafe for "outsiders." Foreign travel is not
 limited. There is no impediment to voluntary repatriation.
 Lebanon throughout its history has been a land of asylum.
 More than 230,000 refugees, nearly all Palestinians, are
 registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency
 (UNRWA). Many more Palestinians, as well as other
 foreigners, are in the country without official refugee
 status. Additionally, some 2,000 Eritrean and approxi-
 mately 500 Assyrian Christians are the concern of the
 local office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR). Many Lebanese voluntarily have gone
 abroad in recent years or have moved their places of
 residence within Lebanon because of the fighting. The
 government is reluctant, and in many cases powerless,
 to prevent the entry of refugees, and deportation is
 rare.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Lebanon has a multi-party political system. No party is
 outlawed. Some militant opposition parties can function
 freely only in areas which their adherents control mili-
 tarily, or in "neutral areas" controlled by the government
 
 
 1035
 forces. Most major political parties either have their own
 press or can get their views fully set forth in sympathetic
 newspapers. However, the military groups operating in the
 country, both Lebanese and foreign, have employed strong
 efforts--including intimidation--to influehce the political
 process. No general elections have been held since 1972;
 the mandate of the present legislature was extended in 1976,
 1978, and 1980 by its own vote. Women have the same legal
 rights as men regarding political participation but, owing
 to cultural traditions, many women refrain from participat-
 ing in the political process. There are no elected women
 officials at the national level and very few serve as
 senior government officials. There is an active trade
 union movement. Laws grant the right to organize, strike,
 and bargain collectively. Lebanese labor law also provides
 for collective contracts, mediation, and arbitration.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no formal, outside investigations of human
 rights violations in Lebanon in 1981. In 1981 the Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) delegation in
 Lebanon reports that it made regular visits to detainees
 at Tell Nahas in Sa'ad Haddad's enclave in the south. In
 a separate case, in spite of representations for access
 to Syrian nationals in the hands of the Phalange militia,
 however, the ICRC reports that it was unable to gain
 regular access to that group of detainees.
 A small Beirut-based Committee for the Preservation of
 the Constitution and Liberties concerns itself with the
 observance of human rights in Lebanon and throughout the
 Middle East. It is recognized by the United Nations
 Commission on Human Rights. From time to time, individuals
 who take a personal interest in human rights deplore the
 lack of government authority, denounce violations per-
 petrated by private groups, or intervene on behalf of
 selected individual victims.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 The Lebanese traditionally have operated one of the freest
 economies in the world, even relying on the private sector
 to provide many of the social services which most govern-
 ments ordinarily supply. The government is now increasing
 its programs in this area, providing relief and reconstruc-
 tion assistance and low-cost loans. The main problems are
 the absence of a political consensus and the internal
 security situation. People are reluctant to invest in
 long-term projects.
 Income is relatively high for the region but is unevenly
 distributed. Disparities are wide between urban wealth
 and rural poverty. There is a large, stable, and highly
 active middle class based on commerce and services. The
 tax system, such as remains, is progressive, but collection
 of direct and indirect taxes is difficult under present
 circumstances and accounts for only a small fraction of
 government revenues. Per capita income was estimated at
 $1,000 in 1974. It declined during the 1975-1976 war, but
 has since climbed back to an estimated $1,200. Lack of
 statistics and the havoc wreaked by six years of warfare
 prevent an accurate analysis of welfare levels.
 
 
 1036
 
 Employment and educational opportunities for women, as
 well as the right to own property or operate businesses,
 are limited in some regions by religion and custom. In
 Beirut, many women hold responsible jobs in the private
 sector. There is one significant legal limitation on
 women's rights which applies throughout the country:
 married women cannot engage in business if their husbands
 take legal steps to prevent them. In addition, women
 formerly were unable to acquire a passport without the
 written authorization of their husband. This require-
 ment was abolished in 1974, but husbands still can take
 legal action to have their wives and children prevented
 from going abroad by means of official notices sent
 to ports of exit.
 Property is privately owned and the right to property is
 protected in normal circumstances. However, the Syrian
 army, the Palestinians, and private militia groups have
 seized property frequently since 1975.
 Shelter is a problem for refugees, both Palestinian and
 Lebanese, as a result of sporadic warfare in south Lebanon
 and, less frequently, in Beirut. To try to ameliorate the
 housing shortage, the government has established a program
 designed to assist low-income families to build and obtain
 housing, with particular emphasis on south Lebanon. The
 government has sought funds from international donors to
 assist in the program, and has committed funds pledged by
 Arab states to the housing sector.
 Adequate health care is available in urban areas from a
 well-developed but privately-funded health sector. The
 population growth rate is 0.8 percent. The government
 recognizes the need to improve existing government-run
 facilities. Public facilities damaged during the war
 are not adequate in many areas, but the government is
 replacing them. In addition to other hospitals, American
 University Hospital in Beirut accepts patients who are
 unable to pay for medical attention. Some international
 organizations are working with the ministry of health to
 improve administration/management capabilities.
 Educational facilities are abundant, but the main burden
 is carried by private schools. If they can afford it,
 Lebanese educate their children in private schools at all
 levels. Over 50 percent of pre-university level students
 attend private schools. Many private elementary schools
 enjoy substantial government subsidies. Public education
 exists through the university level. The adjusted primary
 school enrollment ratio is 96.0 percent. The literacy rate
 in Lebanon varies from 90-96 percent among Christians and
 Palestinians to as low as 30 percent among Shi'a Muslims.
 In addition, the government supports vocational education
 in such areas as mechanics, television repair, aircraft
 maintenance, and other technical fields.
 Lack of an adequate administrative base hinders the
 fulfillment of many programs which would broaden shelter,
 educational, and health facilities and improve the general
 economic infrastructure. The government is stepping up
 the pace of reconstruction, particularly in the south,
 with the assistance of external financial contributions.
