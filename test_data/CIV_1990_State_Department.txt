 COTE D'IVOIRE
 Power in Cote D'Ivoire is concentrated in the Democratic Party
 of Cote D'Ivoire (PDCI) and its long-time, octogenarian leader
 President Felix Houphouet-Boigny. Widespread student unrest,
 a brief military mutiny, and strikes by the police and other
 majoi service sectors, all of which broke out in response to a
 government-proposed austerity program, helped fuel public
 demands for a multiparty system. Although the freedom to form
 other political parties is provided for in the Constitution,
 until the announcement of the return to a multiparty state
 April 30, no other party has been allowed to participate in
 the political process. Since April 30, some 26 opposition
 parties have formed. On October 28 Houphouet, running against
 the leader of Cote d'Ivoire's strongest opposition party, was
 returned to office by a large majority. Elections for the
 unicameral National Assembly, which to date has never
 challenged a policy put forth by the party, were held on
 November 25. The PDCI retained 163 of 175 seats, assuring
 that basic policies will continue to be set by the PDCI in the
 immediate future.
 The Ministry of Internal Security includes the Surete
 Nationale and'the Gendarmerie (the national police),
 structured along French lines. The Surete has a section
 tasked with intelligence gathering and counterespionage
 responsibilities. The Gendarmerie is responsible for
 territorial security, especially in rural areas. There have
 been reports of the Gendarmerie using excessive force in
 dealing with African alien residents.
 During the 1980's, Cote D'Ivoire was squeezed by a heavy debt
 burden and falling prices for its exports, principally coffee,
 cocoa, and tropical woods. Per capita income slipped in
 recent years from well over $1,000 to $680. In 1990 the
 economy continued to decline, and the financial situation
 remained critical. The attempted implementation of salary
 cuts within the framework of the 1989 International Monetary
 Fund and World Bank financial agreement led to widespread
 civil unrest in early 1990, causing the Government to withdraw
 the wage reduction package and to present a revised
 IMF-approved plan for economic reform.
 There were some improvements in human rights in 1990; citizens
 of Cote d'Ivoire participated in multiparty elections for
 president, parliament, and municipalities. However, human
 rights remained circumscribed. While there was no recurrence
 of the 1988 detentions and conscriptions, the stifling effect
 on critics, including students, teachers, and trade unionists,
 still lingers. A businessman widely believed to have been
 convicted on fabricated charges because of his connection with
 a well-known dissident remained in prison. Other areas where
 human rights were limited included the.right of fair trial,
 freedom of speech and press, academic freedom, freedom of
 assembly and association, women's rights, and worker rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political or extrajudicial killings.
 
 
 95
 COTE D'IVOIRE
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of officially sanctioned abduction or
 disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 While the penal code prohibits official violence without
 "legitimate justification," it does not specifically mention
 or prohibit torture or define the level of violence officials
 may use in dealing with detainees or prisoners. Non-Ivorian
 Africans residing in Cote d'Ivoire are routinely treated more
 roughly by police on arrest than are Ivorians. One credible
 eyewitness reported seeing policemen beat a non-Ivorian
 prisoner to extract a confession and branded the sole of his
 foot to hinder escape. There were no instances in 1990 of
 officials being punished for such abuses, and the Government
 denies that they occur.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution and pertinent statutes prohibit arbitrary
 arrest or imprisonment. The Government has occasionally
 detained persons it deemed a threat to internal security, but
 no instances were reported in 1990. In the past, the
 Government had also used the threat of forced conscription to
 discourage peaceful student and trade union efforts to oppose
 the Government or its policies, but again no instances were
 reported in 1990.
 Under the Code of Penal Procedure, a public prosecutor can
 order the detention of a suspect for up to 48 hours without
 bringing charges. The Code dictates that longer detention
 must be ordered by a magistrate, who can authorize periods of
 up to 4 months, but who must also provide the Minister of
 Justice, on a monthly basis, a written justification for
 continued detention. There have been some reports that local
 police have held persons for more than 48 hours without
 bringing charges. Defendants are not guaranteed the right to
 a judicial determination of the legality of their detention.
 The Government has been known to convict critics on trumped up
 criminal charges, so as to avoid being accused of holding
 political detainees.
 Until this year some prominent critics of the Government had
 chosen to live and work abroad, but since April 30, many of
 those with serious political aims have returned (see Section
 2.a.). Political exiles from a number of countries have found
 Cote D'Ivoire a hospitable safe haven, as long as they do not
 engage in political activities directed against their home
 governments.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The modern judicial system is headed by a Supreme Court and
 includes a Court of Appeals and lower courts. Although the
 judiciary is generally considered independent of the executive
 in ordinary criminal cases, in practice as well as under the
 Constitution's separation of powers provisions, the judiciary
 follows the lead of the executive in cases concerning
 perceived national security issues. There have also been
 credible reports that the courts have given lenient treatment
 to persons with personal connections to the Government. One
 businessman, Innocent Anaky, is widely believed to have been
 
 
 96
 COTE DIVOIRE
 convicted on trumped up charges of financial impropriety
 because of his connections to prominent dissident Laurent
 Gbagbo. Anaky is currently serving a lengthy prison sentence.
 Ivorian law establishes the right to a fair public trial, and
 this provision is generally respected in urban areas.
 Defendants have the right to be present at their trials, and
 their innocence is presumed. Those convicted have the right
 of appeal, though in practice verdicts are rarely overturned.
 Defendants accused of felonies or capital crimes have the
 right to legal counsel, and the judicial system provides for
 court-appointed attorneys, for indigent defendants. In
 practice, many defendants cannot afford private counsel, and
 court-appointed attorneys are not readily available.
 In rural areas, justice is often administered at the village
 level through traditional institutions which handle domestic
 disputes, minor land questions, and family law. Dispute
 resolution is by extended debate, with no known instances of
 resort to physical or similar punishment. These traditional
 courts are increasingly superseded by the formal judicial
 system. Civilians are not tried by military courts. Although
 there are no appellate courts within the military justice
 system, persons convicted by a military tribunal can petition
 the Supreme Court to set aside the tribunal's verdict and
 order a retrial.
 The number of political prisoners is unknown but is believed
 to be small. President Houphouet claimed publicly in
 September that there are none.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Since April 30, Ivorians are no longer automatically
 considered members of the PDCI. Those who remain members are
 technically subject to party regulations, which call for
 active participation in party activities and payment of dues,
 which are collected in most cases through deductions from pay
 checks. In general, most party regulations are not strictly
 enforced, and party members who choose not to participate do
 not suffer retaliation. However, two classes of persons
 reported receiving threats to compel adherence to party
 regulations. Journalists reported being told that they must
 support the party line if they wish to continue working. In
 addition, employees of state-owned corporations said they were
 subjected to pressure to affirm loyalty to the PDCI. One such
 employee insisted that those applying for unemployment
 benefits must affirm loyalty in order to receive benefits.
 The Code of Penal Procedure specifies that a police official
 or investigative magistrate may conduct searches of homes
 without a judicial warrant if there is reason to believe there
 is evidence on the premises concerning a crime. The official
 must have the prosecutor's agreement to retain any objects
 seized in the search and is required to have witnesses to the
 search, which may not take place between the hours of 9 p.m.
 and 4 a.m. Legal safeguards against arbitrary searches are
 generally respected, although there have been reports of
 police entering homes of foreign Africans (or rounding them up
 on the streets), taking them to the local police station, and
 extorting small amounts of money for alleged minor offenses.
 There were also reports, difficult to substantiate, of police
 complicity in armed robberies. Private telephone
 
 
 COTE D'IVOIRE
 conversations are believed to be monitored to some degree,
 although the extent of such monitoring is unknown. There is
 no evidence that private correspondence is monitored.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Free expression is provided for in the Constitution but
 significantly limited in practice. The media engage in
 self-censorship. Public criticism of basic government
 policies, the party, or the President, rarely occurs. Critics
 of the Government express themselves in informal situations
 without fear of reprisal. Government policy assigns the media
 a positive role in promoting national unity and development,
 allowing criticism of failures to execute policy but not
 criticism of the policies themselves. Investigative
 journalism is not permitted with respect to the Government and
 its policies. The Government operates radio, television, and
 a wire service, which devote most of their coverage to the
 PDCI. Expanded reporting of opposition party activities did
 take place. The two daily newspapers, the semiofficial
 Fraternite Matin and Ivoire Soir, are printed at facilities
 owned by the PDCI. Some minor political parties have their
 own newspapers, and several periodic pamphlets are published
 privately.
 Although foreign publications circulate freely, in March an
 issue of a French weekly magazine was confiscated before it
 could be distributed because it contained a story on alleged
 corruption by the President and some of his ministers. Three
 foreign journalists were briefly detained as they attempted to
 cover student demonstrations.
 The newspaper of one political party had great difficulties
 when the printing company--in which the PDCI held majority
 ownership-refused to print the first week's issue. When the
 opposition party called for a march on the printer's
 headquarters, the Government responded by deploying troops to
 block the proposed route. Eventually an agreement was
 reached, and the paper was finally printed. The Beninese
 owner of another privately owned printing company was told he,
 would have to stop printing another opposition party's paper,
 or face expulsion from the Cote D'Ivoire. Nevertheless, there
 are now three opposition papers in circulation.
 Opposition frustration over insufficient access to the
 state-run media erupted in a demonstration by supporters of
 the Popular Front (FPI), Cote d'Ivoire's strongest opposition
 party,. on October 14. A PDCI leader publicly responded that
 the media were not required to cover opposition politics,
 except during the period of the official election campaign
 (October 18-28).
 Academic freedom is also restricted. A university professor,
 Pascal Kokora, was fired from his job in January 1988 after
 having his linguistics class compare Ivorian and foreign news
 reports of the trial of former secondary schoolteachers' union
 officials. As no alternative work was available to him, he
 left the country after several months. This report last year
 erroneously indicated that Kokora returned in September 1988
 and was given back his job; in fact, he was not reinstated and
 once again left the country. In 1990 he was again offered his
 job, but he had not returned by year's end. Laurent Gbagbo,
 generally considered Cote D'Ivoire's leading dissident, lived
 
 
 98
 COTE D'IVOIRE
 in voluntary exile in France from 1983 to 1988, when he
 returned and was given a position at the university. Gbagbo
 is now the leader of the best known opposition party, no
 longer suffers restrictions on his movement and work, ran
 against President Houphouet Boigny in the October 1990
 presidential elections, and won a seat in the National
 Assembly in the legislative elections.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is guaranteed by the Constitution but in
 practice is restricted when the Government petceives a
 significant and immediate danger to public order, which can
 include the expression of unwelcome political views. Although
 opposition parties believe that the Constitution permits
 private associations of any sort, the Government disagrees,
 and all organizations must register before commencing
 activities. Registration is sometimes denied, and this device
 has prevented the formation of some political parties,
 although 26 were registered by the end of the year. Permits
 required for public meetings are sometimes denied to the
 opposition, but never to the PDCI. Gatherings occasionally
 are canceled to prevent the expression of controversial views
 in public forums.
 Police used truncheons and tear gas to disperse a peaceful
 demonstration in support of democracy organized by four
 leading political parties on August 31 and then again on
 September 6. Approximately 25 people were injured, and 11
 were arrested. Peaceful demonstrations and political meetings
 took place without hindrance during the officially prescribed
 campaign period immediately preceding the elections.
 Only nonpolitical gatherings are permitted on campus.
 Large-scale student protests and walkouts in the first months
 of 1990 fueled public demands for change to a multiparty
 system. The police used forceful methods--resulting in the
 death of one high school student--in putting down the
 demonstrations. The authorities did not, however, take
 further punitive action against the students. Although there
 were numerous arrests, all students participating in the
 February-March demonstrations were ultimately pardoned. The
 Government canceled the 1989-1990 school year and compressed
 it into 3 intensive months, beginning in September.
 Student dissatisfaction continued in the new academic year.
 In response to a violent but short-lived demonstration at the
 National University on September 24, the Minister of Education
 expelled 60 students (thereby effectively ending their higher
 education) and arrested 48.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There are no known impediments to religious expression. There
 is no dominant religion, and no faith is officially favored by
 the Government. The open practice of religion is permitted,
 and there are no restrictions on religious ceremonies or
 teaching.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government exercises minimal control over domestic travel
 and has reduced the number of internal roadblocks to 18.
 
 
 99.
 COTE D'IVOIRE
 Persons stopped at such roadblocks are frequently harassed and
 "fined" for one minor infraction or another.
 Although Professor Kokora initially had some problems
 obtaining a passport, Ivorians normally can travel abroad and
 emigrate freely. Tvorians have the right of voluntary
 repatriation. There are no known cases of revocation of
 citizenship.
 Cote D'Ivoire's refugee and asylum practices are liberal. The
 country has resettled or granted safe haven to many refugees
 from many different countries. In 1990 more than 230,000
 refugees from the Liberian civil war entered the country.
 While in Cote D'Ivoire, refugees receive 1-year, renewable
 resident visas for their first 5 years in the country, after
 which they may apply for permanent residence. Prior to 1990's
 influx of Liberian refugees, the Cote D'Ivoire did not take
 any significant responsibility for the economic and social
 welfare of refugees, who were the concern of private and
 international organizations. The Government is actively
 involved in managing Liberian refugee relief, even though most
 resources come primarily from foreign and international donors.
 Section 3 Respect for Political-Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 President Houphouet and the PDCI were returned to power in
 1990 in the first multiparty presidential and legislative
 elections since independence. Although proceedings were
 marred by some irregularities and cases of bad faith, the
 consensus among informed observers was that these did not
 significantly affect the overall outcome.
 Before the presidential elections, for example, the National
 Assembly effectively restricted the number of candidates by
 imposing the stringent requirement that each candidate must
 pay a large (approximately $80,000) deposit refundable only if
 the candidate receives more than 10 percent of the vote in the
 first round of balloting. Opposition parties charged that
 there had been inadequate time to prepare for the October 28
 elections, onerous restrictions on holding meetings and
 demonstrations, and unequal access to the media. There were
 numerous assertions by opposition parties of ballot box
 stuffing, procedural irregularities, and fictitious, or
 late-designated, polling places. The consensus, however, is
 that the incidents occurred in a small number of stations.
 Within the PDCI, the President wields power through a
 13-member Executive Committee, a 57-member Political Bureau,
 and a 208-member Steering Committee. On November 7, the
 President appointed a Prime Minister in whose hands are
 explicitly concentrated economic powers and who implicitly
 will decide most day-to-day government affairs, in
 consultation with Houphouet, who retains the power to appoint
 and dismiss the Prime Minister. On November 30, the Prime
 Minister formed his new Government, excluding the majority of
 the old guard and bringing in new blood. The 175-seat
 National Assembly confirms and ratifies legislative
 initiatives received from the President. When operating
 within the former one-party system, the Government tried to
 increase popular support by expanding the size of party
 institutions and by permitting more party members to compete
 in legislative, municipal, and local party elections.

 COTE D'IVOIRE
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is not a party to international human rights
 accords but has been cooperative in the past towards
 international inquiries into its human rights practices, It
 did not respond publicly to Amnesty International's appeals in
 1988 on behalf of the secondary schoolteachers' union, and it
 is thus not known what impact, if any, these appeals may have
 had on the Government's subsequent positive action.
 An internal, independent human rights organization, the
 Ivorian League of Human Rights (LIDHO) formed in 1987,
 previously prevented by the Government from functioning, was
 recognized by the Government in 1990 and held its first
 congress in July. The group began actively investigating
 alleged violations of human rights and issuing press releases
 and reports, some of which were critical of the Government.
 It has not been impeded by the Government.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no overt, official discrimination based on race, sex,
 religion, language, or social status. Although French is the
 official language and the language of instruction in the
 schools, radio and television programs are broadcast in major
 local languages. Social and economic mobility are not limited
 by policy or custom on the basis of ethnicity or religion, but
 there are pronounced inequalities based on sex, with males
 clearly playing the preponderant role overall.
 While some Ivorian traditional societies accord women
 considerable political and economic power, in rural areas
 tribal customs dictate that menial tasks are performed mostly
 by women, although farm work by men is also common. PDCI
 policy is to encourage full participation by women in social
 and economic life, but there is considerable informal
 resistance among employers to hiring women, who may be
 considered "undependable" by virtue of potential pregnancy.
 Female genital mutilation (i.e., clitorectomy) is widely
 practiced in Cote D'Ivoire, particularly among the rural
 Muslim population in the north and west. The operation, which
 usually takes place at puberty as one part of a rite of
 passage, is generally performed outside modern medical
 facilities and can be extremely painful and dangerous to
 health. Clitoral excision is illegal in Cote D'Ivoire, but
 the Government does not make strong efforts to prevent the
 practice, and social pressures are sufficiently strong that it
 persists, particularly in small villages where the tribal
 chief is the primary decisionmaker. Excision is becoming less
 common as the population becomes better educated.
 Violence against women, especially wife beating, is neither
 widely practiced nor tacitly condoned. However,
 representatives of womens' organizations state that wife
 beating does occur, often leading to divorce. Doctors state
 that they rarely see the victims of domestic violence. A
 severe social stigma is attached to domestic violence of any
 kind; neighbors will often intervene in a domestic quarrel to
 protect a person who is the object of physical abuse. The
 courts and police view domestic violence as a family problem
 unless serious bodily harm is inflicted, in which case
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 101
 COTE D'IVOIRE
 criminal proceedings do take place. The Government has no
 clear-cut policy regarding wife beating beyond the obvious
 strictures against violence in the civil code.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to form unions under the Labor Code of
 1964, but for almost 30 years the government-sponsored labor
 confederation, the General Union of Cote D'Ivoire Workers
 (UGTCI), has encompassed almost all union activity. Only the
 university teachers' union (SYNARES), the secondary school
 teachers' union, and the doctors' union are independent of the
 confederation. SYNARES members founded four of .the new
 opposition political parties.
 The leader of the UGTCI occupies a senior position in the
 party hierarchy. Union membership is encouraged but not
 mandatory. The UGTCI is a relatively passive coordination
 mechanism rather than an active force for worker rights,
 although it has had some success improving working conditions
 and safety standards. The UGTCI represents approximately
 one-third to one-half of the organizable work force.
 The right to strike is protected in the Constitution and by
 statute, but in practice strikes are rarely authorized by the
 UGTCI. The Constitution requires a protracted series of
 negotiations and a 6-day notification period before a legal
 strike can be held, effectively making strikes difficult to
 organize. In 1990 there were widespread illegal strikes by
 the military and police, firefighters, teachers, and doctors.
 Although the Government ended the strikes, sometimes using
 force, the majority of the strikers' demands were met.
 Generally, the Government negotiates with strikers and
 resolves at least some of their economic grievances. In the
 1987-88 dispute with the secondary schoolteachers, the
 Government used a variety of powers to coerce the teachers
 back to their jobs. This inclided arrest and detention of 2G
 of them and conscription of several men into mili'tary
 service. In 1990 teachers and doctors found themselves
 ordered back to work after wildcat strikes.
 The UGTCI, which is a member of the Organization of African
 Trade Union Unity, formally prohibits its individual trade
 unions from forming or maintaining affiliations with other
 international professional organizations in their fields.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Labor Code grants all Ivorians the right to join unions
 and prohibits antiunion discrimination. In theory, collective
 bargaining is protected by the labor code. In practice,
 however, only the UGTCI is allowed to engage in collective
 bargaining with individual companies. The UGTCI has
 representatives in every major business enterprise, and the
 UGTCI secretariat often plays a mediation or conciliation role
 in relations between labor and management in'individual
 businesses. There are no export processing zones in Cote
 D'Ivoire, although there is some discussion about creating
 such zones in the future. Labor legislation, to the extent it
 is applied, is the same throughout the country.
 
 
 102
 COTE D*IVOIRE
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There have been no reports of forced labor in Cote D'Ivoire,
 and this practice is prohibited by law. The Committee of
 Experts of the International Labor Organization (ILO) again in
 1990 reviewed the Government's practice of hiring out prison
 labor to private firms and expressed the hope that the
 Government would take the necessary measures to ensure that
 all such work is carried out in a free work relationship in
 conformity with the ILO Convention 29 on forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 In most instances, the legal working minimum age of 16 is
 enforced among government employees and among large
 multinational companies. However, children often work on
 family farms, and in Abidjan some children routinely act as
 vendors of consumer goods in the informal sector. There are
 also reports of children working in what could be described as
 sweatshop conditions in small workshops. Many children leave
 the formal school system at an early age; lower grade
 education is mandatory but far from universally enforced,
 particularly in the rural areas.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Through the Ministry of Labor, the Government enforces a
 comprehensive labor code governing the terms and conditions of
 service for wage earners and salaried workers and providing
 for occupational safety and health standards. Those employed
 in the modern sector are reasonably protected against unjust
 compensation, excessive hours, and capricious discharge from
 employment. The standard workweek is 44 hours. Minimum wages
 vary according to occupation, with the lowest being
 approximately $110 per month. This does not provide a decent
 standard of living for a worker and his family. Government
 medical insurance and retirement programs provide an element
 of income security for salaried employees in the modern
 sector, although the quality of the health delivery system has
 deteriorated badly in recent years, and workers have reported
 great difficulties in obtaining benefits due them under the
 social security system. Month-long paid vacations and a
 substantial severance pay are guaranteed. There is, however,
 a large informal sector of the economy, involving both urban
 and especially rural workers, in which many of these
 occupational regulations are enforced erratically at best.
