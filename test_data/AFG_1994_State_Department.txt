 AFGHANISTAN*
 Afghanistan in 1994 continued to experience civil war and widespread lawles-
 ness. The nominal nine-party coalition Government failed to function effectively
 and armed factions opposed or supported President Burhanuddin Rabbani. Several
 provincial administrations maintained limited functions, but banditry was prevalent
 m much of the country amid a general decline of law and order. In July pro-Rabbani
 forces met with some independent ones in Herat and called for a follow-up tradi-
 tional gathering of notables to take up the peace effort. The Herat Conference suf-
 fered from a lack of broad participation owing in part to fears its outcome had been
 predetermined by pro-Rabani eements. The U.N. Special Mission to Afghanistan
 made several efforts to reach a political solution to the crisis, including convening
 a conference of Afghan notables in Quetta. By year's end, the United Nations ob-
 tained agreemenom te major factions o part                   ipate m a broad-
 based interim ]government and began to negotiate the details.
 The simmering civil war intensified on January 1 when troops commanded by the
 leader of the National Islamic Movement (NIM), General AIul Rashid Dostam,
 aided by forces loyal to Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar attempted a coup
 d'etat against President Rabbani. The attempt was foiled, but die protracted fight-
 ing caused heavy civilian casualties and the destruction of much of Kabul. By the
 end of 1994, an estimated 1 million Afghans remained displaced by fighting, and
 the number of killed or wounded during the year was estimated at over 34,000 in
 Kabul alone.
 The coalition Government has not established a national military and police force.
 The political instability and the presence of heavily armed party militias in Kabul
 have led to an array of regional security bodies, many of which operate independ-
 ently of party and governmental authorities. They are responsible for many human
 rights abuses.
 Agriculture, including increased levels of opium poppy cultivation, remained the
 mainstay of the economy. The civil war impeded reconstruction of irrigation sys-
 tems, repair of market roads, and clearance of some 10 million Soviet land mines.
 There was modest reconstruction in some areas, notably Herat, Mazar-i-Sharif, and
 Nangarhar, where provincial authorities have reestablished a degree of order and
 civil administration.
 Large-scale human rights violations occurred in 1994. The U.N.'s Special
 Rapporteur on Afghanistan concluded that "as Afghanistan has no effective central
 government, the imputation of state responsibility in international law is problem-
 atic." The warring factions not only failed to protect the human rights of civilians,
 but often wantonly violated those rights by specifically targeting noncombatants.
 Gunmen affiliated with the 10 armed factions were often responsible for assassina-
 tions, looting, rapes, and kidnapings for ransom. Combatants from several factions
 blocked food an  medcal supplies desperately needed by displaced people in the
 Kabul, Kunduz, and Taloqan areas.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-In 1994 an estimated 8,000 Afghans
 died in Kabul alone as a result of the civil war. Most were civilian victims of artil-
 lery, rocket, or air strikes launched by forces aligned with Hekmatyar or Rabbani.
 In many cases civilian deaths were incidental to the military actions of the
 belligerents, but in some cases combatants purposefully targeted civilian areas.
 Combatants also sought to assassinate rival commanders and their sympathizers.
 *The Ame ican Embassy in Kabul has been closed for security reasons since January 1989.

 The perpetrators of these assassinations and their motives were difficult to identify,
 as political motives are often entwined with family and tribal feuds, battles over the
 drug trade, religious zealotry, and personal vendettas.
 In July a reporter for the British Broadcasting Corporation, Mirwais Jal, was
 abducted and murdered by unidentified gunmen. His body bearing over 20 stab and
 bullet wounds, was later found in a no man's land. In duly Commander Naser of
 Laghman Province, who was affiliated with Hekmatyar's party, and 10 of his body-
 guards were reportedly murdered as Naser traveled to meet with a rival. In Septem-
 ber Commander Sadiq, also a follower of Hekmatyar, and his bodyguard were mur-
 dered in Nangarhar Province while returning from a visit to Pakistan. Sadiq was
 rumored to have been involved in narcotics trafficking, a Pshtun intratribal dis-
 pute, and the factional fighting in Kabul-any of which may have provided the mo-
 tive for his murder. None of the perpetrators was apprehended. President Rabbani's
 forces apparently targeted Hekmatyar himself in an August 12 air raid that demol-
 ished his living quarters. Subsequent air attacks were made on a hospital facility
 where Hekmatyar was thought to be under treatment for injuries sustained in the
 August 12 air raid; in fact he had escaped serious injury.
 Two brothers who had murdered a rival were executed in Herat after an on-the-
 spot adjudication by an Islamic magistrate. Summary exer'itions following Shari'a
 court trials were reported elsewhere in the country.
 b. Disappearance.-In April Amnesty International (AI) issued a report claminig
 that dozens of people had disappeared or were being held in incommunicado deten-
 tion. It appealed to all sides to release their captives and stop taking hostages. AI
 reported that Zia Nassry, an American citizen, was allegedly arrested by pro-
 Rabbani forces in Kabul in 1992; Nassry's welfare and whereabouts remained un-
 known in 1994.
 Hostage taking for ransom or political reasons was common. In June unknown
 gunmen abducted an Afghan guard working at an inactive diplomatic mission in
 Kabul. The victim was tied, blindfolded, threatened with death, beaten, held for 16
 days, and finally released when his family paid the ransom. The kidnapers were not
 apprehended. I July Mullah Rocketi, a commander of Abdul Rasul Sayyafs
 Ittehad-i-Islami Party, released seven Pakistani and two Chinese hostages he had
 kidnaped to force the Government of Pakistan to release his brother from prison and
 return or pay for weapons allegedly taken from him. Rocketi had held some of the
 captives since 1992.
 Groups in Russia listed nearly 300 Soviet soldiers who had served in Afghanistan
 as missing in action or prisoners of war. Most were thought to be dead or to have
 voluntarily assimilated into Afghan society. Some continued to be held against their
 will by their Afghan captors.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Armed factions reportedly employed torture and ill-treatment frequently to extract
 information from prisoners or break their will. Mullah Rocketi's forces hung some
 foreign captives (see Section 1.b.) upside down and beat them to force them to write
 letters urging that ransom be paid, according to media accounts.
 Due to the lack of a functioning national judicial system, the powers that be re-
 portedly imposed traditional laws and punishments, such as the amputation of
 hands of those convicted of theft.
 Marauding militiamen abused many women in Mazar-i-Sharif in January and in
 Kunduz in March, according to international media and other sources. The U.N.
 Special Rapporteur reported that in 1994 there were innumerable cases of rape and
 that in some instances women had been "hunted down." In March armed men re-
 peatedly raped a 15-year-old girl in Kabul after breaking into her family's house and
 kiher nather for allowing her to attend school, according to an AI report issued
 in December. The report added that thousands of women and children had been
 raped in Afghanistan since April 1992, when the mujahedin groups took power in
 Kabul.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-With the breakdown of law and order,
 justice was not administered "by the book" in many localities. Little was known
 about procedures employed in 1994 for takingpersons into custody and bringing
 them to trial. Presumably, ractices varied considerably among the localities.
 e. Denial of Fair Public ria.-With the collapse of a nationwide judicial system,
 many municipal and provincial authorities relied on some form of Shari'a, or Is-
 lamic, law and traditional tribal codes of justice. However, little is known about the
 implementation of these precepts.
 No firm estimate is available on the number of political prisoners, but a Pakistan-
 based human rights group estimated that well over 1,000 people were held as politi-
 cal prisoners or hostages by armed factions or independent commanders.
 
 
 1203
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Wide-
 spread forced entry into homes and looting occurred in the northern cities of Mazar-
 i-harif and Kunduz early in the year during intense fight J  there. There were
 fewer reports of looting in-Kabul compared with 1993, probably because much of the
 city was in ruins and many items of value had already -been carried off. A U.N. facil-
 ity in Mazar-i.Sharif and the Pakistani Embassy in Kabul were ransacked in early
 1994. The Afghanistan National Archives were looted in May.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Ten armed factions, aligned in two loose blocs, fought for power in Kabul
 and the provinces, causing widespread destruction and indiscriminate killing. Com-
 mand and control of armed men was often haphazard and informal, a condition that
 obscured the relationship between the perpetrators of human rights violations and
 the political leaders with whom they were nominally affiliated.
 On Januar 1, General Doatam's troops in Kabul, theretofore aligned with Presi-
 dent Rabbam, switched to Prime Minister H ekmatyar's side and attempted to oust
 the President in a coup d'etat. The President's forces quickly countered and the en-
 suing fighting engulfed much of Kabul and northern parts of the country. A signifi-
 cant number of civilians were killed in the northern cities of Mazar-i-Sharif and
 Kunduz during heavy fighting. Fighting raged in Kabul's old business district with
 both sides employing heavy weapons and air strikes which took a heavy toll of civil-
 ian life and wreaked destruction on much of Kabul. As intense fighting in Kabul
 continued for most of January, hundreds of thousands fled to safer areas of the
 country. Most of the belligerents received outside assistance, despite U.N. calls to
 halt the influx of materiel to the warring factions.
 In February Prime Minister Hekmatyar imposed a food blockade on northern
 Kabul, the area controlled by President Rabbani's troops. The U.N. Security Council
 and the United States Government condemned the food blockade and asked that it
 be lifted. In March General Dostam's militia briefly captured the northern city of
 Kunduz from the forces of Ahmed Shah Masood, President Rabbani's de facto De-
 fense Minister. Amid widespread pillaging by the victorious troops, local people re-
 volted and assisted Masoods fighters in retaking the city, according to a Western
 journalist who visited the area.
 Sharp clashes broke out in Kabul in late June, when Masood launched an attack
 against Dostai's and Hekmatyar's forces and drove them from key strongholds in
 central Kabul. They reacted by launching nearly daily rocket attacks on the city,
 which took a heavy civilian toll.
 In September the relatively quiet Shi'a quarter of Kabul erupted in intense fight-
 ing between rival Shi'a factions, which were quickly backed by other armed groups.
 In the last half of September alone, some 2,650 people, mostly civilians, were report-
 edly killed or wounded in this fighting. On September 27 a rocket hit a Kabul wed-
 ding party' killing 40 people and injuring 70, according to U.N. and media sources.
 In November armed re igious students known as the "taliban" (disciples) movement
 took over Kandahar and- neighboring areas in southern Afghanistan after defeating
 local commanders in battle. The taliban cleared roadblocks from the main highway
 and implemented a strict social code. According to media accounts, the taliban lim-
 ited the use of videotapes, prohibited public music and dancing, and restricted other
 forms of public behavior.
 The Afghan countryside remainedplagued by an estimated 10 million land mines
 sown during the Soviet occupation. The UtN. sponsored mine awareness, detection,
 and removal programs, but the mines will pose a threat for years to come.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-There are no laws effectively providing for free-
 dom of speech and press, and the nominal Government lacks the authority to pro-
 tect these rights. Senior officials of various warring factions allegedly attempted to
 intimidate reporters and influence their reporting. The few newspapers, all of which
 were published only sporadically, were largely affiliated with political parties. There
 was a pro-Rabbani radio and television service in Kabul. Prime Minister Hekmatyar
 has his own radio and television service near Kabul, as does General Dostam in the
 northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Civil war conditions in Kabul
 and the tenuous security situation in much of the country effectively limited Af-
 ghans' freedom of assembly and association. The prohibition against non-Islamic po-
 litical parties was reinforced by President Rabbani's call for jihad, or holy war,
 against General Dostam and his followers. The President's backers do not view
 Dostam's movement as Islamic. One positive development was the establishment of
 numerous local councils, or shuras, at the provincial and sub-provincial levels to es-
 tablish order and organize development efforts.
 
 
 1204
 c. Freedom ofReligion.-Afghanistan's official name, the Islamic State of Afghani-
 stan, reflected the country's adherence to Islam as the state religion. Some 85 per-
 cent of the population is Sunni Muslim, with Sbi'a Muslims comprising the bulk of
 the remainder. The small number of non-Muslim residents in Afghanistan may
 practice their faith, but may not proselytize, according to an official source.
 The country's small Hindu and Sikh population which once numbered about
 50,000, continued to shrink as its members emigrated or took refuge abroad.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Coucniry,7Fore n Trael, Em'gration, and Re-
 pat riation.-A though in principle citizens have the rght to travel fIely both inside
 and outside the ountry, their abiity to travel within the ountry was hampered by
 warfare, brigandage, millions of undetected land mines, the disrepair of the road
 network, and the moribund state of the domestic air service. Despite these obstacles
 many people continued to travel relatively freely.
 International travel became more difficult in 1994, as the Government of Pakistan
 closed its border in January to new refugees from Afghanistan. Only Afghan travel-
 ers holding valid visas were officially allowed entry, but thousands of undocumented
 Afghans crossed into Pakistan, including some admitted on medical or humanitarian
 grounds. Kabul International Airport was ciosed due to the fighting, and most diplo-
 matic missions moved out of Kabul in January.
 Afghans ontinued to form one of the wor-ld's largest refugee populations. Well
 over 3 million Afghans were refugees abroad, with 1.2 million in Pakistan, roughly
 2 million in Ira, and 70,000 in Russia. The limited repatriation of 1993 slowed to
 a trickle in 1994, with 78,000 returning from Iran and 75,400 from Pakistan. How-
 ever, an estimated 70,000 new refugees arrived in Pakistan in the first half of the
 year alone. According to the United Nations and other sources, Russia forcibly repa-
 triated 21 Afghans in August, including 8 orphaned children of Afghan Communist
 Party members aceted for resettlement when the Soviet army depatd from Af-
 ghanistan in 1989. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees protested the forced
 repatriation.
 Of the roughly 35,000 registered Tajikistan refugees in northern Afghanistan at
 the start of 1994, approximately half were repatriated, including nearly all of the
 18,000 previously housed at a refugee camp across the border from Termez,
 Uzbekistan. Those in northeastern Afghanistan faced more difficult obstacles to re-
 patriation, including irregular transport across the Amu Darya river, fighting along
 the Tajik-Afghan frontier, and explosions in June at the repatriation center at Shir
 KhanBandar, presumably caused by militant extremists who wished to manipulate
 the Tajik refugees for purposes such as recruiting them into the armed movement
 seeking to overthrow the government of Tajikistan.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The continuing violent struggle for political power among the 10 armed factions
 effectively precluded the citizens from peacefully and democratically changing their
 government or form of government.
 The nine-party coalition Government, established in 1993 under the Islamabad
 and Jalalabad Accords, existed only in nominal terms. It failed to function as a cohe-
 sive governing structure, and by July President Rabbani's inner circle of advisors
 occupied most positions of influence in the President's limited sphere of control.
 Under the terms of these Accords, President Rabbani's term in office was to expire
 in late June. However, he announced that he would not be held to these widely ig-
 nored agreements, and referred back to a unilateral edict by a Grand Council,
 convoked by the President in late 1992, that provided for a 2-year presidential term.
 A group of clerics, deemed the Supreme Court by President Rabbani, upheld the
 President's decision to extend his tenure.
 In March U.N. Secretary General Boutros Ghali dispatched a Special Mission to
 Afghanistan to help mediate the onflict. The Mission, headed b  former Tunisian
 Foreign Minister Mahmoud Mestiri, canvassed Afghans on how te United Nations
 ould foster a peae p rocess. It later attempted to bring representatives of the fac-
 tions to preliiinary discussions on a poltia solution,but the Rabbani faction re-
 fused to talk with General Dostam's representatives.
 In July Governor Ismail Khan of Herat convened a gathering of several hundred
 pro-Rabbani and some neutral representatives to discuss a possible peace process.
 U.N. officials attended as observers. The Herat conferees recommended that a loya
 jirga, or traditional grand assembly, be held by late October. Anti-Rabbani elements
 viewed the proceedings as biased in favor of Rabbani and largely ignored them. In
 September Mestiri again gathered a group of Afghan notables to advise the U.N.
 on mediating the conflict. The major factional leaders accepted the advisory group's
 framework for peace, which included a permanent cessation of hostilities, the cre-
 
 
 1205
 ation of a national security force, and the establishment of an interim ruling author-
 ity.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 In 1994 there were no known human rights groups in Afghanistan. At least one
 group operated outside the country; the Afghan League of Human Rights' annual
 report was produced in Pakistan. The civil war and lack of security made it difficult
 for human rights organizations to monitor the situation inside the country.
 In September theJ.N. S        a                           and met with sen-
 ior Afghan leaders. Heavy fighting in Kabul prevented him from visiting the capital
 He issued a preliminary report ofi findings in November.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Rel4ion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Afghan custom and tradition imposes limits on women's activities be-
 yond the home. Under the Communist regime of the 1980's, a growing number of
 women,, particularly in urban areas, worked outside the home m nontraditional
 roles. his trend was reversed with the ouster of the Communist regime in 1992,
 and in 1994 women were increasingly precluded from public service. In conservative
 areas in 1994, many women appeared in public only if dressed in a complete head-
 to-toe garment with a mesh covered opening for the eyes. In Faryab Province the
 local warlord's forces reportedly directed unmarried women over age 12 to get mar-
 ried or face the prospect of rape by the warlord's gunmen.
 The U.N. Special Rapporteur noted a series of 21 ordinances governing the behav-
 ior of women in Afghanistan, reportedly issued by a nine-member committee of the
 High Court. These ordinances specified, inter alia, that a woman's veil must cover
 her whole body, that perfumed women are regarded as adulteresses, that a woman
 must not leave her house without her husband's permission, and that a woman
 must not look at strangers. There is no information available on how or whether,
 these ordinances were enforced. After the taliban movement tooic control of
 Kandahar, it reportedly told women to venture outdoors only if accompanied by a
 male relative. Prime Minister Hekmatyar decreed that women must wear Islamic
 dress and refrain from "aimless wandering." In December the provincial council of
 Jalalabad reportedly prohibited women from working in offices except in the fields
 of health and education. In 1994 four women were stoned to death in Kunduz after
 being found guilty by Islamic judges of capital offenses, according to a local govern-
 ment authority.
 Children.-Local administrative bodies and international assistance organizations
 undertook to look out for children's welfare to the extent possible. Malnourishment
 of children as a result of the food blockade was reported in Kabul, and the general
 disruption of health services countrywide due to the civil war put many young peo-
 ple at grave risk.
 People With Disabilities.-It is not known whether the nominal Government took
 any measures to protect the rights of the mentally and physically disabled or to
 mandate accessibility for them. Victims of land mines were a major focus of inter-
 national humanitarian relief organizations, which devoted resources to providing
 prostheses, medical treatment, and rehabilitation therapy to amputees. In_ August
 the U.N. Development Program initiated a million-dollar project to strengthen com-
 prehensive community-based rehabilitation services for disabled Afghans.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Assocition.-Little was known about labor laws and practices in
 Afghanistan in 1994. There were no reports of labor rallies or strikes. Labor rights
 were not clearly defined, in the context of the breakdown of governmental authority,
 and there was no effective central authority to enforce them. Many of Kabul's indus-
 trial workers were unemployed due to the destruction or abandonment of the city's
 minuscule manufacturing base.
 h. The Right to Organze and Bargain Collectively.-Afghanistan lacks a tradition
 of genuine labr-management bargaining. There were no known labor courts or
 other mechanisms for resolving labor disputes.
 c. Prohibition of Frced of Compulsory Labor.-No information was available on
 government edicts regarding forced or compulsory labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-There was no evidence that the
 Government was able to enrclle labor laws relating to the employment of children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There was no available information regarding
 a statutory minimum wage or the enforcement of safe labor practices. Many workers
 were apparently allotted time off regularly for prayers and observance of religious
 holiday.
