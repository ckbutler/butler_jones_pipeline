 AFGHANISTAN *
 The political situation in Afghanistan changed dramatically in 1992. After 14
 years in power, aided by massive support from the former Soviet Union, the
 Najibullah regime collapsed in April, and power was assumed by leaders of the Af-
 ghan resistance. Most of the resistance leaders agreed to a series of power-sharing
 arrangements to span 2 years with an interim Government in three phases. The
 first, a Council under the leadership of Sibghatullah Mojadeddi, took control of
 Kabul in April. Its mandate expired after 2 months at which time it was replaced
 by a Leadership Council under Burhanuddin Rabbani. The Leadership Council was
 originally to govern the country for 4 months, during which time it would prepare
 a Pan-Afghan Grand Council (Shura), which would choose an 18-month interim
 Government. The third phase of the interim government was to draft a constitution,
 establish permanent governmental institutions, and make preparations for holding
 nationwide elections. This third phase was delayed several times by factional com-
 petition for power. This competition pitted the factions that formed the resistance
 against one another, and included elements that supported the previous regime. In
 late December, a Grand Council finally met and selected Rabbani to continue as
 President for a period of 2 years. The Grand Council also reportedly selected mem-
 bers of a national assembly. However, a number of Afghan leaders questioned the
 legitimacy of the Council and the means by which its members hadbeen selected.
 It is unclear whether the successive interim governments have established any
 formal internal security apparatus. Many of the resistance factions, including those
 in the interim gvernments, almost certainly developed ad hoc security arrange-
 ments prior to their victory over the Najibullah regime. Bloody rivalries frequently
 emerged between and within these groups. Differences were often settled, and oppo-
 sition controlled, through the use of force. Such tactics may still be employed by the
 various factions. It is also possible that elements of the Najibullah regime's security
 apparatus, the Ministry of State Security, have been retained by the interim govern-
 ments.
 The Afghan economy is agricultural, with land tenure in the hands of individuals
 or family/tribal groups with some land remaining under feudal control of the tradi-
 tional Khans. An entrepreneurial/trading class and some small-scale manufacturing
 exist.
 The absence of any effective central authority was the factor of greatest signifi-
 cance to human rights problems in 1992. In most areas of Afghanistan, civil author-
 ity was in the hands of local councils, resistance leaders, or a combination of the
 two. While some councils and leaders have managed to govern effectively, observers
 have noted the absence of the rule of law and a clear legal system throughout much
 of the country. Because of the weakness of the interim governments and the contin-
 ued factional violence, the human rights situation changed from one marked by
 broad governmental oppression to an environment in which individual rights were
 neither defined nor protected and were routinely violated. Although the interim gov-
 ernments declared an amnesty, for members of the former regime and issued a num-
 ber of proclamations guaranteeing human rights, the Government does not have suf-
 ficient power to give force to these guarantees throughout the country. Reports of
 torture, ill-treatment, and extrajudicial execution of prisoners were widespread dur-
 ing the fighting in Kabul which followed Najibullah's ouster. Innocent civilians were
 taken hostage, and several politically motivated revenge killings of prominent per-
 sonalities of the former Communist regime were reported. Robbery, looting, and id-
 naping for ransom were common in Kabul. Members of the Sikh and Hindu commu.

 nities were frequent victims of crimes and attacks, despite interim President
 Rabbani's call for protection of their basic rights, and thousands fled to Pakistan
 and India. The rights of women also appeared to be in jeopardy.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-While precise information is difficult
 to obtain, it is generally known that political killings, including summary executions
 of political opponents, were common under the Najibullah regime. Revenge killings
 of prominent Afghans associated with the Najibullah regime took place in the
 months after his government lost power. Some killings were carried out by forces
 loyal to the interim Government, others by factions acting independently. In the im-
 mediate aftermath of the fall of the Najibullah regime, the central Government in
 Kabul was unable to control such violence.
 The former Afghan Supreme Court Justice Abdul Karim Shadan was abducted,
 tortured, and killed in Kabul on May 3. Other Afghans prominent in the former re-
 gime believed to have been assassinated include: Mansoor Hashmi, the Minister of
 a r and Power during the Taraki and Amin governments; Dost Mohammad, a
 Pushtun Army officer and former commander of the Kabul garrison; Dur Moham-
 mad Wafakash, former governor of Badghiz; Sher Mohammed Shuar, a Pushtun
 from Nangarhar province who served as PDPA (People's Democratic Republic of Af-
 ghanistan) Secretary in Nangarhar, and Abdol Ahad Wolessy, a diplomat and
 Najibullah's ambassador to East Germany. In addition, other reports stated that re-
 sistance forces killed about 40 members of the former government security forces
 who were taken prisoner on April 30. Eyewitnesses also reported the torture and
 execution of a member of the former ruling party in the Ministry of Interior.
 b. Disappearance.-Under the Najibullah regime, Afghans opposed to Communist
 rule frequently disappeared; many were killed and others imprisoned indefinitely.
 Under the interim Governments, some officials of the former Communist regime dis-
 appeared; some were abducted and later executed for alleged political crimes. In ad-
 dition, hostage taking was common, particularly by members of rival factions. In
 June sectarian clashes between Sunni and Shi'a factions in Kabul resulted in wide-
 spread hostage taking. Media sources reported several thousand hostages were
 taken, most of whom were later released, although some prisoners were reported
 hanged by both sides. The Government was unable or unwilling to stop hostage tak-
 ing, but was reportedly able to negotiate the release of some Shi'a prisoners (see
 Section 1.g.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Before the ouster of the Najibullah regime, torture and other forms of cruel and in-
 human treatment were common. Former prisoners of Kabul's Pul-e-Charkhi prison
 confirmed that the Najibullah regime's torture techniques included electric shock,
 severe beatings, confinement of many prisoners to small cells, and psychological tor-
 ture. There were also reports of torture and ill treatment under the interim govern-
 ments.
 Some reported executions took place after inadequate legal procedures, including
 no right of appeal. At least three public hangings of criminals convicted by the new
 Government of robbery, looting, and murder were conducted by amateur angmen,
 resulting in needless prolonged suffering. Some members of the interim govern-
 ments advocated the imposition of traditional Islamic punishments such as amputa-
 tion, public lashing, and stoning for a variety of offenses.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Acording to informed observers, the rule
 of law has broken down in most of Afghanistan. Justice is administered locally with-
 out regard to any clear legal system. Little is known about legal protections under
 current conditions, and it is doubtful that any uniform procedures exist for taking
 persons into custody and bringing them to trial. Since there have been few Western
 observers in Kabul since the fall of the Najibullah regime, it is impossible to provide
 an accurate assessment of the extent to which arbitrary arrest and detention has
 occurred in the capital. There was a report of one foreign national being detained
 arbitrarily by Kabul authorities.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The new Rabbani Government declared its com-
 mitment to the imposition of Sharia, or Islamic law, and it appeared that the secu-
 lar court system of the Najibullah regime was to be reorganized along traditional
 Islamic lines. Little is known about how these courts now operate, but there have
 been media reports of summary trials and punishment, including executions. Tradi-
 tional, tribal procedures probably also play a prominent role in the judicial process,
 particularly in areas outside the central Government's control. In many cases, these
 procedures constitute denial of a fair public trial by international standards.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-After
 the change of government in April, there were many instances of looting, forced
 entry of homes, and other forms of arbitrary interference, some allegedly committed
 by forces associated with the interim governments. Much of this could be attributed
 to the deteriorating law and order situation and the release from jail of prisoners
 held on criminal charges.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Afghanistan's civilian population has borne the brunt of more than a decade
 of civil war. More than 1 milion Afghans have died, 5 million have fled to other
 countries, and upwards of 1 million more are internally displaced.
 The fighting that marked the fall of the Najibullah regime and the struggle
 among Aghan factions for control of Kabul resulted in a large number of civilian
 casualties.
 In June and July, intense fighting between Shi'a and Sunni forces provoked re-
 prisal attacks against civilians, including kidnaping, beatings, and indiscriminate
 shelling and rocket attacks in residential areas, This fighting left more than 100
 dead and 400 wounded in the streets of Kabul. There were reports of mass hangings
 of captured prisoners by both sides. The interim Government reportedly negotiated
 the release of Shi'a prisoners kept in shippimg containers for several days.
 In August the Hezb-i.Islami group of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar began a 3-week rock.
 et and artillery attack on Kabul that killed as many as 2,000 people. Thousands
 more fled the capital to the countryside or to Pakistan. Millions of landmines sown
 by Soviet regime, or resistance forces remain scattered around fortifications and
 roads and in the countryside. There is a U.N.-sponsored program to detect and re-
 move mines, but the devices will pose a significant hazard to civilians for years to
 come.
 There were continuing security problems for humanitarian assistance workers in-
 side Afghanistan, including attacks on convoys of relief goods and the murder in
 April of an International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) nurse. These problems
 forced most humanitarian assistance organizations to reduce their programs in
 Kabul.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The interim governments declared that Afghans
 have a right to free press and free speech, but lacked the authority to protect free-
 dom of expression throughout the country. The Rabbani Government decreed that
 all publications, broadcasts, and academic activities must conform to Islamic norms.
 It also announced its intention to confiscate all "un-Islamic" books, but reports on
 enforcement were sketchy. There are few independent newspapers or journals being
 published in Kabul.
 President Rabbani's Jamiat-e-Islami faction allegedly used the radio and tele-
 vision transmitters under its control in Kabul to further its own goals, to the exclu-
 sion of other groups. A number of faculty members from Kabul University report-
 edly left after the change of government in April, fearing they would be persecuted
 for their views or previous political affiliations.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Rabbani Government
 made no formal statements regarding the right to peaceful assembly and associa-
 tion; however, it announced a ban on all non-Islamic groups.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The population of Afghanistan is overwhelmingly Mus-
 lim. The interim governments have sought to promote greater adherence to strict
 Islamic codes of conduct.
 President Rabbani called for the protection of "life, property, honor, and prestige"
 for the roughly 50,000 Sikhs and Hindus in Afghanistan and declared their complete
 freedom to perform religious rituals. There were, however, numerous reports of as-
 saults against Sikhs and Hindus during the general disorder in Kabul. Substantial
 numbers of Afghan Sikhs fled to India and were granted the protection of the U.N.
 High Commissioner for Refugees.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Domestic travel remains severely constrained by wartime conditions.
 However, civilian travel between regions does occur, despite arbitrary checkpoints,
 the prevalence of mines, and unexpected outbreaks of violence. The airport was at-
 tacked several times after July and the control tower destroyed, making air travel
 into Kabul difficult.
 Fourteen years of fighting in Afghanistan have created the world's largest refugee
 population, comprised predominantly of women and children. During 1992 at least
 1.1 million Afghans voluntarily returned to Afghanistan from Pakistan. Roughly
 250,000 of the approximately 2 million Afghan refugees in Iran also returned. The
 interim governments did not appear to restrict the movement of refugees; neither
 
 
 1118
 did local authorities other than, in some cases, to demand payment for transit of
 their territory.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 In late December, a Grand Council met and selected interim President Rabbani
 to continue as President for a period of two years. The Grand Council also report-
 edly selected delegates to a 200-plus member national assembly. However, a number
 of Afghan leaders questioned the legitimacy of the Grand Council and the means
 by which its members had been selected. It is unclear what steps the new Govern-
 ment intends to take to ensure that the political process is representative of the
 country's diverse ethnic and religious groups. The delegates to the Grand Council
 reportedly issued decrees barring the activities of un-Islamic groups, and requiring
 that only those "faithful to the Islamic revolution" be appointed to government
 posts.
 Women traditionally have not played an active role in Afghan politics. This began
 to change during the decade of Communist rule. It is unclear whether women will
 be permitted to participate in the political process in the future.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no known local human rights groups in Afghanistan, and the extremely
 unsettled conditions in Kabul have made it difficult or nongovernmental human
 rights organizations to play a role in monitoring human rights issues. The ICRC
 was forced to withdraw its personnel working at its hospital in Kabul as a result
 of the fighting in Augst. One organization, the Afghan League of Human Rights
 (which is based in Peshawar, Pakistan), condemned extrajudicial executions and ap-
 pealed to the interim governments to establish the jury system to ensure fair trials
 and to abolish "secret special courts" of the type that were prevalent under the Com-
 munist regime. The interim government did not respond.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The participation of Afghan women in activities beyond the home and fields is
 limited by longstanding beliefs, customs, and religious practices. In the late 1950's,
 Afghan governments officially sanctioned a wider public role for women, and some
 women egan working in the government and the private sector. Girls from else-
 where in the country attended secondary schools and sought admission to institutes
 to pursue careers, including teaching and nursing, which in some cases permitted
 employment in the provinces. The social position of women in areas controlled by
 the Communist regime improved, and the role of women in some nontraditional oc-
 cupations expanded. Whether the Rabbani Government will permit the continuation
 of such practices is unclear.
 The interim Government announced in May that it did not believe that Islam pro-
 hibited women's activities in political, social, and cultural spheres but that Islamic
 attire should be worn. There were reports that women wearing Western dress in
 Kabul were sent home to change to traditional Islamic dress. President Rabbani
 later announced that women may work but that they ought to do jobs that are "suit-
 able" for them and do not violate Islamic laws. Subsequent to that declaration, re-
 ports surfaced of women being forced from positions in various government min-
 istries. Women reporters on television and radio were also removed from their posi-
 tions.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-There was little reliable reporting on labor laws and
 practices under the interim governments. No labor rallies or strikes were reported.
 The Government does not have the means to enforce worker rights at the present
 time, nor is there a functioning constitutional or legal framework which defines
 them.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no tradition of genu-
 ine labor-management bargaining in Afghanistan. There is no information on any
 progress in establishing labor courts and other mechanisms for the resolution of dis-
 putes.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There were no reports on govern-
 ment edicts regarding forced or compulsory labor, nor on its incidence.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-There is no evidence that the Gov-
 ernment enforces a labor law relating to the employment of children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-No information on any statutory minimum
 wage is available. Provision appears to be made for time off for prayers and observ-
 
 
 1119
 ance of religious holidays. There appear to be no effective enforcement mechanisms
 to ensure fair and safe labor practices.
