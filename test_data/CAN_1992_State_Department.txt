 CANADA
 Canada is a constitutional monarchy with a federal parliamentary form of govern.
 ment. Representatives in the multiparty political system are elected by universal
 suffrage at local, provincial, and federal levels. The Constitution defines government
 responsibilities and is subject to interpretation by an independnt judiciar.
 Elected civilian ofici ale control the federal, prvincial, and municipal police
 forces, which are responsible for national and lcarlaw enforcement, and the armed
 forces, which have no role in domestic law enforcement except in strictly dfined na-
 tional emergencies.
 Canada has an open economic system that encourages private ownership, invest-
 ment, and entrpreneurship.
 Canadians enjoy, in law and in practice, a wide range of freedoms and individual
 rights as enumerated in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which was appended
 to Canada's revised Constitution in 1982. Principal complaints of human rights
 abuses arise in the areas of discrimination against nonwhite minorities (including
 instances of use of excessive force by police) and discrimination (much of it familial)
 against women. The Constitution and laws provide avenues for legal redress of such
 abuses, and the Government and private organizations try to ensure that human
 rights are respected in practice at all levels of society. Canada actively promotes re-
 spect for human rights and democratic development around the world.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There were no politically motivated
 or other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-Secret arrest, clandestine detention, and politically motivated
 disappearance did not occur.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and ill-treatment are prohibited by law; however, credible reports of exces-
 sive use of force (including deadly force) by police continue. The reports often, but
 not always, involve nonwhite minorities. Incidents involving excessive force in To-
 ront, Montreal, and Halifax continue to strain relations between the cities' minor-
 ity communities and the police. The growing realization of the potential problem of
 the misspplication of deadly force has led some jurisdictions to take steps to address
 the problem.
 In Toronto, the shootings of 8 persons (all of whom were members of a black mi-
 nority and at least 3 of hiom were unarmed) over 4 years were partly responsible
 for noting which took place there on May 4. Ontario Premier Bob Rae established
 a task force to inquire into the cause of the riot. In its report, the task force rec-
 ommended improvements in police training, changes in the justice system, and more
 controls on the use of lethal force by police. In response, Ontario reconstituted its
 race relations and  licing task force and will requirepe  ofers to ide written
 reports eah ti     y draw a gun. The task force also proposed to narrow the jus-
 tification for the use of lethal force.
 In Montreal, 6 men-3 blacks and 3 Hispanics-have been killed by the Montreal
 Urban Police (MUC) in the pset 5 years. A Special Coroner appointed by the Min-
 ister of Public Security concluded in a report released on May 7 that there was a
 "totally unacceptable" level of racism within the MUC which, if let uncrrectd,
 could endanger lives. The Minister of Public Security carried out the chief rec-
 ommendation of the Coroner's Report when he appointed a retired appeals judge to
 head a special inquiry into the MUC.
 On December 7, the British Columbia Provincial Government's Commission on
 Native Issues opened hearings on specific allegations of law enforcement abuses
 against natives of the Chilcotin band. The Chilcotin allegations range from racial
 and cultural insensitivity tonmore serious accusations of police brutality and cover-
 up.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Canadian law prohibits arbitrary arrest
 and imprisonment, and this prohibition is respected in practice. A 1988 law author-
 izes the Federal Government to take special measures (including the suspension of
 civil liberties) to ensure safety and security during national emergencies. The 1939
 Official Secrets Act prohibits the private possession, distribution, and publication of
 information deemed prejudicial to the interests of the State and provides that per-
 sons under suspicion may be arrested without a warrant.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial system is based on English common
 law at the federal level as well as in most provinces. In the Province of Quebec, the
 judicial system is based on the Napoleonic Code. Judges in Canada are appointed.

 In criminal trials, Canadian law provides for a presumption of innocence of the de.
 fendant until proven guilty as wefl as the right to a public trial and to counsel. Free
 counsel is provided to indigents.
 The Official Secrets Act provides that trials involving classified government infor-
 mation be held in secret, with certain presumptions in favor of the State. Prosecu-
 tions under this statute are extremely rare, and convictions are hard to sustain on
 appeal. There are no political prisoners in Canada.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Canadi-
 ans are afforded strong legal protection from arbitrary interference under the Con-
 stitution, and federal and provincial governments generally de not interfere with an
 individual's basic rights without due process. Intrusive searches may be carried out
 only when there is a reasonable basis for presuming that the person is involved in
 criminal activity. Police officials face judicial penalties if they abuse a person's pri-
 vacy without first obtaining a judicial search warrant.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedem of speech and press is provided for by
 the Constitution and generally respected in practice. Restrictive decisions by provin-
 cial film censorship boards and laws prohibiting certain form of hate literature and
 pornography are some exceptions to these freedoms. The Canadian Human Rights
 Act makes it illegal to make repeated communications by telephone that expose a
 persn or people to hatred or contempt. Minority language and cultural rights are
 also protected by the Constitution. However, certain sign laws in the Province of
 Quebec restrict the public display of any non-French-language signs by merchants
 and other institutions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of assembly and asso-
 ciation is guaranteed. Permits are not required for meetings.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is complete freedom of religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on movement within or outside Canada, in-
 cluding the rights of emigration and repatriation. Canada continues to be a haven
 for many refugees and displaced persons. However, continuing and widespread con-
 cern that many economic refugees have taken advantage of Canada's generous refu-
 gee law to make spurious requests for asylum led to changes in the refugee law.
 In December the parliament passed legislation tightening access to its refugee de-
 termination system. These changes seek to limit entry to the refugee and asylum
 systems to legitimate applicants and to simplify dealings with persons whose claims
 have been determined to be unfounded.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change their Govern-
 ment
 Canada is governed by federal and provincial governments that are freely elected
 through universal suffrage. Legislative elections at both the federal and provincial
 levels must be held at least every 5 years, and these often result in a transfer of
 power to opposition parties. Voter participation rates are high. The Governor Gen-
 eral is the British Queen's representative as Head of State. In practice, power is
 exercised by'the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, who usually are elected members
 of the 295-seat House of Commons. Five parties are represented in the Commons,
 and several others function at the provincial level. All provinces and territories have
 similar freely elected legislatures.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of private human rights organizations operate freely. The Cana-
 dian Human Rights Commission and its provincial counterparts investigate and
 seek to resolve complaints of discrimination and abuses of civil rights in public and
 private cases.
 Canada has a record of cooperation with outside investigations of alleged human
 rights abuses. In a prominent case, Canadian natives brought allegations of human
 rights abuses in a 1990 standoff between Mohawk Indians and the Government
 near Montreal and other grievances to the attention of the United Nations Human
 Rights Commission (UNHRC) and various international human rights organiza-
 tions. The Canadian Government submitted information to the UNHRC on the cases
 and permitted a European-based human rights organization to monitor the situation
 involving the standoff.
 Canada actively promotes human rights in international forums, and the Federal
 Government encourages nongovernmental organizations to pursue investigations of
 human rights abuses throughout the world.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Food, shelter health care, and education are available to all inhabitants regard-
 less of'race re1igion, sex, ethnic background, or political opinion. Article 15 of the
 Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees equal benefits and protection of the law
 regardless of race, national or ethnic origin, color, re  n, sex, age or mental or
 physical disability. These rights are re speted Inpractice. Nevertheless, Canada's
 multicultural society does have racial problems. Canada's treatment of its native
 peoples is probably the most important human rights problem facing the country.
 Old-disputes between the Canadian and provincial governments on the one hand
 and aboriginals on the other have led to civil disobedience and confrontation. In
 1990 natives, religious groups, and human rights activists alleged human rights
 abuses during the 78-day armed Mohawk stan doff at Oka, Quebec. Most of the ap-
 proximately 40 natives chard in the aftermath of the Oka incident were acquitted
 in 1992. However, the land ciaims issue that was the basis of the Oka confrontation
 has yet to be fully addressed. Tension between police and natives resulted in several
 confrontations in Quebec in 1991 and 1992.
 During 1992 the Federal Government continued to address many of the issues un-
 derlying aboriginal complaints. Together with provincial and territorial leaders, the
 Government included aboriginal leaders as full participants in negotiations leading
 to a constitutional reform package. In addition to other provisions the reform pack-
 age addressed many outstanding native concerns and recognized an inherent ab-
 original right to self-government within Canada. However, the complex package of
 constitutional reforms failed in a nation-wide referendum on October 26. In the
 aftermath of the referendum, the Federal Government committed itself to pursuing
 a more limited, "community" form of self-government under existing laws and regu-
 lations.
 The Royal Aboriginal Commission, established in 1991, began hearings to exam-
 ine aboriginal concerns, including self-government, land claims, and native justice.
 Chilcotins in central British Columbia alleged that authorities failed for 24 hours
 to respond to an automobile accident; the deaths of several of the six native pas-
 sengers might have been prevented if the police response had been timely. On e-
 comber 7 the Commission on Native Issues opened hearings to take evidence on this
 and other allegations of systemic abuse of native communities by law enforcement
 agencien
 WJith few exceptions, Quebec law requires immigrants to educate their children
 in French. The province argues that the education and sign laws protect French lan-
 guage and culture, but those who prefer English resent these restrictions. English-
 sjpeakers from the rest of Canada are reluctant to accept transfers to Quebec by
 their employers. Because of the atmosphere engendered by the language laws and
 because of a perceived lack of economic opportunity in Quebec province for those
 who mother tongue is not French, many young English-speakers bern there are
 leaving. The government has announced its intention to reconsider the language
 laws in 1993.
 Federal and provincial governments, the private sector and women's rups have
 been effective in keeping the issue of family violence and, in particular, violence
 against women in the forefront of Canada's social agenda. Various reports have doc-
 umented the incidence of physical, psychological, and emotional abuse within fami-
 lies and the high rate of homicide of women by male partners. Federal and Provin-
 cial Governments and nongovernmental organizations have attempted to address
 the issue of family violence by funding various educational and preventive pro-
 grams. The Government also passed a new rape law that defines consent andre-
 stricts the introduction of a woman's sexual history in rape trials. The press has
 given wide overageBtoagornment studies of spousal violence against women. Tele-
 vision advertisements and publicity campaigns have also targeted the abuse of
 women and children within families. Police forces have taken a greater interest in
 the handling of incidents of cojugal violence. The Government declared December
 6 an annual"Day of Comme moraton and ActioAaVin  an iolenc Agat Women"
 to commemorate the anniversary of the 1990 University of Montreal killing spree
 that claimed the lives of 14 women.
 Women are well represented in the labor force including business and the profes-
 sions, at wages comparable to those of men.  ntario law requires all employers
 (public and private) with more than 10 workers to provide equal pay to men and
 women for work requiring comparable skill. Women enjoy marriage and property
 rights equal to those of men.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Except for members of the armed forces, workers in
 bth the public and private sectors have the right to associate freely. the Canada
 
 
 Labour code, which covers all employees under federal jurisdiction, protects these
 rights at the federal level, while provincial labor legislation protects all other orga-
 nized workers. Trade unions are independent of the Government and may affiliate
 freely with international organizations. About 37 percent of Canada's non-
 agricultural work force is organized into trade unions. All worker rights protected
 in law are respected in practice. The Canadian Labor Congress (CL), the largest
 of the countrys labor federations, is a member of the International Confederation
 of Free Trade Unions. Slightly more than one third of CLC member unions are also
 affiliates of American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations
 unions.
 Canadian workers have the right to strike, with the exception of certain groups
 of essential public sector employees. The Canadian Government maintains that the
 right to strike may be limited or prohibited 'in respect of essential services." The
 International Labor Organization (ILO), after reviewing complaints from workers
 denied the right to strike, recently requested the Canadian Government to establish
 a procedure when negotiations result in deadlock. Restrictions vary from province
 to province. In the first 8 months of 1992, there were 29 major work stoppages (in-
 volving500 or more employees), only 4 of which were illegal work stoppages. Twen-
 ty of the 29 disputes have been resolved, either through direct bargaining, medi-
 ation or in the case of public sector workers in Newfoundland, legislation.
 b. fhe Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers in bath the public
 (with some exceptions for police) and private sectors have the right to organize and
 bargain collectively. Collective bargaining is protected by law and freely practiced,
 though some essential public sector employees have limited collective bargaining
 rights which vary from province to province. Antiunion discrimination is banned by
 law, and there are effective mechamsms for resolving complaints.
 All labor unions have full access to mediation, arbitration, and the judicial sys-
 tem.
 Canada has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is illegal and not
 practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children--Child labor legislation varies from
 province to province. The Federal Government generally prohibits youth under 17
 years of age from working for the Federal Government while school is in session.
 Pvinces generally prohibit those under age 15 or 16 from working without paren-
 tal consent, working in any hazardous employment, or working at night. These pro-
 hibitions are effectively enforced through inspections conducted by  e federal and
 provincial labor ministries.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-bMinimum wages are established in both fed-
 eral and provincial jurisdictions. The federal minimum wage covers about 10 per-
 cent of the Canadian work force. All provinces and territories have minimum wage
 rates which are higher than the federal level. At the federal level, minimum wage
 rates are established by ministerial order and enforced by the Department of Labor.
 Provincially, the rates are enforced by the labor wage boards or other labor boards.
 Five provinces (Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Alberta, and British
 Columbia) have lower minimum rates for youths and students. Less than 1 percent
 of workers covered by the federal minimum wage are paid at the minimum rate,
 and approximately 5 percent of workers covered by provincial minimum wages re-
 ceive the minimum rate. A family with only one member employed and working at
 minimum wages would be below the poverty level.
 Labor standards vary from province to province, but all limit the standard work-
 week to 40 or 48 hours. The Employment Standards Legislation provides 1 full day
 of rest per week.
 The Federal Government establishes health and safety standards for the approxi-
 mately 10 percent of workers covered by federal labor legislation. Provincial and ter-
 ritorial legislation provides for health and safety standards for other workers. Fed-
 eral and prvincial/territorial labor departments enforce these standards through in-
 spections. Federal, provincial, and territorial laws protect the right of Canadian
 workers with "reasonable cause" to refuse dangerous work and to file complaints
 about such conditions.
