 AUSTRIA
 Austria is a constitutional parliamentary democracy. A coalition government of
 the Social Democratic Party and People's Party originally formed after the 1986 na-
 tional election, continued in office after the October 1990 election. The Freedom
 Party, the Green Party, and the Liberal Forum, which split from the Freedom Party
 in February 1993, form the opposition.
 The police and security organs are subordinated to the executive and judicial au-
 thorities. However, there continued to be reports of police abuse.
 Austria affords its citizens a high standard of living.
 Human rights are highly respected in Austria; individual rights and political free-
 doms are provided for in the Constitution and generally protected.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated or extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no political abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture is banned by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights
 and Fundamental Freedoms, which is incorporated into the Constitution.
 As a result of continued allegations of police brutality over the past few years,
 regulations which stipulate more clearly the limits of police conduct during inves-
 tigations took effect in May. According to the Interior Ministry and human rights
 groups, complaints of police brutality decreased significantly.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary de-
 tention or exile.
 In criminal cases the law provides for investigative or pretrial detention for up
 to 48 hours, except in cases of charges of "aggressive behavior', by which time an
 investigative judge must decide on the legality of continuing the detention. Provided
 the prosecutor requests detention and the investigative judge ars, the accused
 may be held for a maximum of 2 years pending completion of an investigation.
 Grounds for investigative detention are specified in the law, as are conditions for
 release on bail. A reform of Austrian law regarding investigative and pretrial deten-
 tion has been adopted and is scheduled togo into effect in January 1994. The new
 law requires mandatory reevaluation of a detention by the investigative judge at 2
 weeks, 1 month, and every 2 months after the arrest.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent of the executive and
 legislative branches of government. Judges are appointed for life and may not, in
 principle, be removed from office. Jury trials are prscribed for major offenses, and
 those convicted have the right of appeal. Written charges must be presented to the
 accused who has the right to be represented by a lawyer. The accused are presumed
 innocent, and trials are public.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 provides for the protection of personal data collected, processed, or transmitted by,
 government agencies, public institutions, and private entities. Constitutional provi-
 sions also protect the secrecy of the mail and telephone. Following the restructuring
 of the state police after a 1990 scandal involving the monitoring of private citizens
 without sufficient grounds, a 199 federal police law introduced parliamentary con-
 trol over the state police and the military secret service on a permanent basis. Par-
 liamentary subcommittees to oversee these organs were formally established in Sp-
 tember 1993.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press-These freedoms are provided by the Constitu-
 tion and generally respected in practice, although stringent slander laws discourage
 reports of police brtality. Austria has a free, independent, and multifaceted press,
 ranging from conservative to Communist. Publications may be removed from cir-
 culation if they violate legal provisions concerning morality or public security. As
 a matter of practice, such cases are extremely rare. Opposition viewpoints are given
 wide attention in Austrian publications. A 1992 law lowered the minmum sentences
 for public denial, belittlement, approval, or justification of Nazi crimes. The lowering
 
 
 786
 of minimum sentences has had the desired effect of increasing the conviction rate
 of those accused of neo-Nazi activities.
 Austrian radio and television have been government monopolies but present di-
 verse points of view. There have been no complaints of either subtle or direct censor-
 ship. Alaw passed in July allows for establishment of private radio and television
 stations. Cable television is widely available, allowing Austrians access to inter-
 national broadcasts. They also listen to radio broadcasts from other European coun-
 tries.
 Freedom of academic expression is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. Public demonstrations require a permit from
 the police authorities, who are limited to considering only the public safety aspect
 of the proposed demonstration, not its political purpose. Permits are routinely is-
 sued. The Constitutional Law of 1945, as amended in 1947 prohibits Nazi organiza-
 tions and activities. The Austrian State Treaty of 1955 also made an exception to
 freedom of association in the case of Nazi organizations and activities. The Law on
 the Formation of Associations stipulates that permission to form an association may
 be denied if it is apparent that the organization will pursue the illegal activities of
 a prohibited organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-This right is provided by the Constitution, although the
 Treaty of St. Germain, which is also incorporated into the Constitution, restricts
 this freedom to the practice of religions that are compatible with public safety and
 morality. There are no known instances of a religion being banned under the Treaty.
 In order to qualify as a recognized religious organization under Austrian law reli-
 gious groups register with the Government. Although 78 percent of the population
 is Roman Catholic, most of the world's major religions are represented and practice
 their faiths freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict freedom of movement within the
 country or the right to change residence or workplace. Austrian residents are free
 to travel abroad and to emigrate. Citizens who leave the country have the right to
 return.
 Over the past few years the Government tightened its asylum regulations. Asylum
 seekers must apply for asylum in the first country in which they are able to make
 application (all surrounding countries are considered by Austria to be "safe" for asy-
 lum seekers) and are not allowed to stay in Austria while appealing their rejected
 asylum requests. As a result, asylum applications dropped from 11,875 in the first
 half of 1992 to 2,490 in the first half of 1993. Authorities approved 9.1 percent of
 asylum applications in the first half of 1993. Opposition groups, including political
 parties and human rights organizations, maintain that Austria's strict new asylum
 laws violate the right to apply for asylum and the right of asylum seekers to reside
 in Austria while their rejected asylum requests are appealed.
 A new residence law went into effect in July. The law is broad in scope and does
 not distinguish between immigrants and nonimmigrants- several of its provisions
 generated vociferous public debate. An implementing regulation which required that
 each foreign resident have a minimum of 10 square meters of living space to be eli-
 gible for a residence permit (including renewal of a previous permit) was withdrawn.
 A provision that a foreign resident could be deported if the authorities did not proc-
 ess a properly filed application for a residence permit within 6 weeks was retained
 and justified as intended to force the bureaucracy to process applications expedi-
 tiously. Human rights organizations and the Catholic Caritas organization strongly
 criticized the residence law. The debate about whether to amend the controversial
 residence law continued at year's end.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Austria is governed through a democratic parliamentary system. The Constitution
 stipulates that national elections must be held at least every 4 years. Elections are
 free and regularly draw high levels of participation. Ballots are secret. There is uni-
 versal suffrage for those over 19 years of age.
 The 1990 election continued a coalition government composed of the two largest
 political parties, the Social Democratic Party, which won 80 seats in Parliament,
 and the People's Party, which won 60 seats. Three other parties are represented in
 Parliament-the Freedom Party, the Greens, and the newly formed Liberal Forum.
 Although there are no legal impediments, women are significantly underrepresented
 in government and politics. According to a Parliamentary spokesperson, 41 of 183
 parliamentarians are women (22.4 percent). Although the political culture in Aus-
 tria has been and is dominated by men, women are making inroads. The Social
 
 
 787
 Democrats, at their summer congress, established a 40 percent quota for female par-
 liamentarians, to be fully implemented in 10 years.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Allegations of improper activities on the part of the authorities are discussed and
 investigated by the press, public groups, and private individuals without govern-
 ment hindrance. Both international and local human rights groups operate freely.
 Austria recognizes the competence of the European Human Rights Commission in
 Strasbourg to implement the European Convention on Human Rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Austria has a comprehensive public welfare system, the benefits of which are
 available to all citizens on a nondiscriminatory basis. In employment and in other
 areas, comprehensive legal protection is provided against discrimination because of
 race, sex, religion, language, disability, or social status. In December, a letter bomb
 campaign targeted public persons known for their sympathy and support of immi-
 grants and refugees in Austria. Among those seriously injured was the Mayor of Vi-
 enna. The ongoing  lice investigation has led to the arrest of six men associated
 with rightwing, neo-Nazi organizations.
 Women.-Most legal restrictions on women's rights have been abolished. Women
 are still prohibited by law from night work in most occupations, however, and this
 ban is sometimes used as a pretext for not hiring women. Nurses. taxi drivers, and
 a few other occupations are exempted. The Women's Ministry defends the night-
 work ban on the basis that women are also the" primary care providers for children
 during the day.
 Women are entering the work force in increasing numbers and have made sub-
 stantial progress toward economic equality. Nevertheless, in practice, they are gen-
 erally underrepresented in the professions and business. Women are not allowed in
 the Austrian military. There is no conscription of women as there is for men. Recent
 suggestions by various politicians that women do mandatory civilian service have
 been rejected by the Women's Ministry and women's organizations.
 Although labor laws providing for equal treatment extend to women in the civil
 service, women are nonetheless underrepresented in government service also. To
 remedy past practice, women of equivalent qualifications are to be placed in jobs
 ahead of men in civil service areas in which less than 40 percent of the employees
 are women. The 40-percent hiring quota was part of the Women's Omnibus Law
 which went into effect in January 1993. According to the Women's Ministry, al-
 though the quota was contained in the law, there are no penalties for not meeting
 it. Women may be awarded compensation of up to 4 months' salary if discriminated
 against in promotions because of their gender. Compensation may also be awarded
 to victims of sexual harassment.
 Laws are in place to combat the problem of violence against women, but enforce-
 ment is often difficult, according to a Women's Ministry spokesperson. When police
 arrive on the scene of a domestic dispute where a woman has been physically
 abused, they can do nothing to the man if he is peaceful or the woman does not
 file a complaint. A court order forcing a man to stay away from his wife or girlfriend
 generally takes 3 to 6 weeks to obtain.
 Children.-The Government is seriously committed to protecting children's rights
 and welfare. The law provides for 2 years of paid maternity leave for mother or fa-
 ther. Parents receive a government payment of about $1,200 for the birth of each
 child and between $100 and $140 per month for the maintenance of each child.
 Child care is often provided or subsidized by federal, state, and local governments.
 Because of a severe shortage of government child care centers, private centers are
 increasingly in demand. No pattern of societal abuse of children exists.
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-The rights of members of all minorities are
 fully respected. In addition, the Government recognizes Croat, Slovene, Hungarian,
 Czech, and Slovak minority groups, and is discussing recognition of the Roma and
 Sinti (Gypsy) minorities. The Ethnic Minorities Law allows a recognized minority
 to establish an ethnic group council to advise the Government on issues regarding
 that minority. It also provides for the establishment of minority language schools
 in some communities. All of the five recognized minorities have established minority
 councils.
 People with Disabilities.-Disabled individuals are protected by law from discrimi-
 nation in housing, education, and employment. Austrian law requires businesses
 and state and federal government offices to employ I disabled person for every 25
 to 45 employees, depending on the type of work, or to pay a fee to the Government.
 
 
 The Government uses collected fees to pay for programs for the disabled-such as
 training programs and grants to firms to help pay the wages of disabled workers.
 Some businesses and offices opt to pay the fee rather than employ people with dis-
 abilities. No federal law mandating access for the disabled has been enacted. Some
 public buildings are virtually inaccessible for those unable to climb stairs.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to form and join unions
 without prior authorization. This right is protected under general constitutional
 guarantees of freedom of association. In practice, Austrian trade unions have an im-
 portant and independent voice in the political, social, and economic life of the coun-
 t. In 1993, 53 percent of the work force was organized in 14 national unions, all
 fwhich are members of the Austrian Trade Union Federation (ATUF). This organi-
 zation has a strong, centralized leadership structure. Individual unions and the Fed-
 eration are independent of government or political party control, although formal
 factions within these organizations are closely allied with political parties.
 Although the right to strike is not explicitly provided by the Constitution or by
 national legislation, it is universally recognized. Strikes have been comparatively
 few and usually of short duration. A major reason for Austria's record of labor peace
 is the system of "social partnership", an unofficial forum for cooperation among
 labor, management, and government. At the center of the system is the Joint Parity
 Commission for Wages and Prices, which has an important voice on major economic
 questions.
 The ATUF, its political wings, and its member unions have affiliations with all
 three world labor federations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the right to or-
 ganize andhargain collectively. The labor movement enjoys widespread acceptance,
 and almost all large companies, private and state-owned, are organized. Worker
 councils operate at the enterprise level, and workers are entitled by law to elect one-
 third of the members of the supervisory boards of major companies. Collective agree-
 ments covering wages, benefits, and working conditions are negotiated by the ATUF
 with the National Chamber of Commerce and its associations, which represent the
 employers. Wage-price policy guidelines are set by the Joint Parity Commission. A
 1973 law obliges employers in enterprises with more than five employees to prove
 that job dismissals are not motivated by antiunion discrimination. Emploers ound
 guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers firedfor union
 activities. Austrian labor and business representatives remained in disagreement
 over how to comply with the obligation under ILO Convention 98 to provide legal
 protection against arbitrary dismissals to employees in firms with five employees or
 less.
 Workers are further protected by mandatory membership in the Austrian Cham-
 bers of Labor, to which all employees except civil servants belong. These Chambers
 carry out studies and prepare legislative proposals. They are obliged to provide free
 legal assistance, including a lawyer, to any employee requesting it. Typically, legal
 disputes between employer and employees regarding job-related matters are han-
 dled by a special arbitration court for social affairs. The ATUF is exclusively respon-
 sible for collective bargaining. The leaderships of the Chambers and the ATUF are
 elected democratically.
 Austria has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by law
 and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum legal working age
 is 15. The law is effectively enforced by the Labor Inspectorate of the Ministry of
 Social Affairs.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legislated national minimum wae.
 Instead, nationwide collective bargaining agreements set minimum wage rates Ty
 job classification for each industry. A worker whose annual income falls below a pov-
 erty line (approximately $850 per family member per month) is eligible for social
 service benefits. The average Austrian has a high standard of living, and even work-
 ers at the low end of the wage scale have a relatively adequate minimum standard.
 Although the legal workweek has been established at 40 hours since 1975, more
 than 50 percent of the labor force enjoys collective bargaining agreements setting
 the standard workweek at 38 or 38.5 hours.
 Austria has enacted extensive legislation setting occupational health and safety
 standards, under which the Labor Inspectorate of the Ministry of Social Affairs con-
 ducts inspections and ensures the effective protection of workers. Inspectors have
 the authority to "tag" an observed safety or health risk without a court order, an
 action that effectively shuts down the affected machinery or process until it con-
 
 
 forms with mandatory safety standards. Workers may file complaints anonymously
 with the Labor Inspectorate, which may bring suit against the employer on behalf
 of the employee. In practice this option is rarely exercised; workers normally rely
 instead on the Chambers of Labor, which file suits on their behalf.
