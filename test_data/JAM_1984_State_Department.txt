 JAMAICA
 Jamaica is a constitutional parliamentary democracy with a
 mixed economy emphasizing the private sector. It is a member
 of the British Commonwealth. A governor general, appointed by
 the Crown on the advice of the Prime Minister, represents the
 Queen, while the elected Prime Minister, the leader of the
 majority party in Parliament, is the country's chief
 executive. The Parliament is comprised of the elected House
 of Representatives (currently 60 members).and the appointed
 Senate of 21. The powers and procedures of Parliament
 correspond to those of the Westminister model.
 Two major political parties, the Jamaica Labour Party and the
 People's National Party, have alternated in power since the
 first elections were held under universal adult suffrage in
 1944. The Jamaica Labour Party's leader, Edward Seaga, has
 been Prime Minister since November 1980. The Constitution
 requires that general elections be held at least once every
 five years; the last general election was held on December 15,
 1983. However, because an outdated voters' list was being
 used, the People's National Party boycotted the election and
 the Jamaica Labour Party gained all sixty seats in the House
 of Representatives. The next parliamentary elections must be
 held before January 10, 1989.
 The opposition's boycott created an anomalous and
 unprecedented situation for democratic Jamaica. The Jamaica
 Labour Party has attempted to compensate for the absence of an
 elected parliamentary opposition by appointment of independent
 senators to the upper chamber and enhancing opportunities for
 citizens to appear and address the House.
 The Government continues to respect civil rights, including
 freedom of religion, speech, press and association. It also
 respects the right of citizens to change their government
 through free elections.
 The relatively small, apolitical security apparatus comes
 under the Ministry of National Security and consists of the
 Jamaica Constabulary Force, the Jamaica Special Constabulary
 Force, and the Jamaica Defense Force. The latter consists of
 a regular and a reserve force and includes an air wing and a
 coast guard. Since 1974, the Jamaica Defense Force has been
 authorized to. conduct joint operations with the police in
 order to maintain the peace, under the Suppression of Crime
 Act.
 The British system of justice operates in Jamaica. The law
 comprises English common law and statutory law enacted both
 before and since independence. Jamaican statutes are usually
 patterned after English law, as modified to fit local
 conditions.
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Officially sanctioned murder of political opponents does not
 occur in Jamaica. However, Jamaica suffers from a high level
 of violent crime, some of which is politically motivated.
 Much of this violence was associated with election campaigns.
 The December 1983 election, however, was quiet, with minimal
 violence'and no deaths.
 
 
 588
 JAMAICA
 Both major parties, as well as the Communist Workers Party of
 Jamaica, have supporters who occasionally employ violence for
 political purposes. On the whole, the legal system has been
 unable to bring the guilty parties to justice because of a
 pervasive code of silence enforced at the local level.
 During 1984, there were several killings rumored to have been
 politically motivated. The police have made several arrests
 and cases are awaiting trial. In all cases, the Government
 and opposition have condemned the incidents. The Government
 has, in most cases, moved expeditiously to arrest the
 perpetrators.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no evidence of abduction, hostage-taking, or
 disappearances occasioned by official forces. In most
 incidents where people disappear and are later discovered
 dead, the victims are linked with criminal cases or have been
 accused of being police 'informers.*
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Generally, legal prohibitions against torture and cruel,
 inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment are respected.
 Access to detainees by relatives, attorneys, physicians, and
 friends is routine. There have been occasional claims in the
 press of unjustified killings, beatings, and other abuses by
 police, and the Communist Workers Party of Jamaica has
 periodically charged the police force with politically
 motivated harassment. Many observers believe a small minority
 of individuals within the police force abuse their authority,
 especially during operations against criminal gunmen.
 Officials involved in the abuse of prisoners are liable to
 punishment, and citizens bringing such charges through the
 Government or through the courts have won compensatory damages.
 In 1984, the parliamentary ombudsman issued a report on the
 deplorable prison conditions in Jamaica. The country's jails
 are described as unsanitary and extremely overcrowded. The
 report has been taken up by Parliament and given prominence in
 the press. Both the public and the Government agree on the
 need to improve prison conditions, but the latter is hampered
 by severe resource constraints. A corrections bill,
 incorporating various elements of penal reform, is presently
 before the Parliament.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There are no political prisoners in Jamaica. The security
 forces do not need a warrant in order to detain persons
 *reasonably" suspected of having committed a crime. However,
 the Suppression of Crime Act, which has been extended since
 1974, limits the period of detention before being charged to a
 "reasonable time.- The detainee must be brought before a
 court "without delay.' Practice is for appearance before a
 magistrate or a court on the next court day, usually within a
 few days of arrest. In the event of a further delay,
 authorities must indicate why the person is being held longer.
 Arbitrary detention without trial has not been reported,
 although the opposition has periodically complained of
 irregularities in preventive detention practices by the police.
 
 
 589
 JAMAICA
 Habeas corpus is implicit in the Constitution, rooted in
 common law, and respected by the courts and the police. The
 Constitution guarantees that a detained person must be
 informed of charges "within a reasonable amount of time.*
 There is a functioning system of bail, granted on a
 discretionary basis.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Jamaica has an independent judiciary. Persons who have been
 charged with a criminal offense have access to legal
 representation, and legal counsel is provided to indigents in
 criminal cases. The Court of Appeal and the Parliament may
 refer cases to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in
 the United Kingdom. The legal system is overburdened, and
 many cases take years to come to trial.
 In addition to the regular courts, there is also the Gun
 Court, which was established in 1974 as an extraordinary means
 of dealing with the serious problem of violent crime. It
 considers cases involving the illegal use or the possession of
 firearms or ammunition. There are restrictions on public
 attendance and less stringent rules of evidence in the Gun
 Court. Hearings are conducted before a judge, except in
 murder cases, which require a jury. The Gun Court has become
 increasingly controversial. The 1983 Gun Court Amendment Act
 made sentencing discretionary by eliminating the previously
 mandatory sentence of life imprisonment, gave all resident
 magistrates more leeway to grant bail, allowed magistrates
 outside of the Kingston area discretion in referring
 non-capital offense cases to the Gun Court, and removed to
 juvenile courts cases involving children under the age of 14.
 A continuing review of the cases of persons given life
 sentences prior to the adoption of the Gun Court Amendment Act
 has resulted in some 100 persons receiving parole this year.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary intrusion of the state
 into the private life of the individual. Individual rights
 are protected, and there is no arbitrary monitoring of
 correspondence or telephones, nor restrictions on receipt of
 foreign publications. Search warrants are not required to
 enter homes or businesses when crime is "reasonably'
 suspected. However, regulations approved by Parliament in
 1980 require that every effort be made by the security forces
 to have the owner or occupant of the premises present during
 the search.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are guaranteed in the Constitution
 and are observed in practice within the broad limits of libel
 laws and the State Secrets Act. There is no censorship nor is
 there interference in academic studies. Jamaica's principal,
 privately owned daily newspaper, The Daily Gleaner, has been
 critical of Jamaican governments through the years. Several
 small newspapers and magazines are also published, including
 two by the opposition parties, both of which are highly
 critical of government policies. Foreign publications are
 generally available.
 
 
 590
 JAMAICA
 In June 1984, there was a widely publicized incident involving
 a police shooting in which the police interfered with and
 manhandled The Daily Gleaner photographer at the scene who was
 trying to take pictures. The Police Commissioner promptly
 apologized and a subsequent editorial in the newspaper
 expressed satisfaction at the measures taken and reassurances
 given by the police that it would not tolerate any fettering
 of the press. Jamaica's one television station is government
 owned, although there are plans to establish a second channel
 with private participation. The government-owned television
 and radio network has historically been accused of bias in
 favor of the Government by whichever party is in opposition.
 A second radio station, while partially government owned, is
 politically independent.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association are guaranteed in the
 Constitution. A large variety of professional groups and
 private associations function freely. Public demonstrations
 and rallies are staged by all political parties without
 government interference. Public demonstrations require police
 permits which are normally granted. In 1984 the opposition
 demonstrated at the formal opening of Parliament and has since
 held demonstrations on several other occasions. Three
 nonviolent demonstrations took place in April, even though
 police permits were refused because the mandatory notice was
 not given.
 Approximately 25 percent of the Jamaican work force is
 organized into strong, independent trade unions. The right to
 form and belong to trade unions is constitutionally
 guaranteed, and unions are among the most active organizations
 in the country. The two major unions are each associated with
 one of the two major political parties. They operate as
 independent organizations, however, and differ at times with
 their parties. They have contributed many leaders to the
 national political process, among whom are the current Deputy
 Prime Minister/Minister of Foreign Affairs and two former
 Prime Ministers. In May 1984 the 21st Biennial Congress of
 the National Workers Union unanimously elected former Prime
 Minister Michael Manley, leader of the People's National
 Party, as the union's new president. Unions make active use
 of the bargaining rights guaranteed in the Labor Relations and
 Industrial Disputes Act of 1975. Jamaican workers, including
 government employees, frequently exercise their right to
 strike.
 Jamaican unions are affiliated with regional and international
 labor bodies.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed in the Constitution and is
 well established in Jamaica. A great variety of religious
 groups, including several African and animistic religions and
 cults, operate freely. More than 80 percent of the population
 professes one Christian denomination or another. In September
 1984, Prime Minister Seaga was the only head of government
 invited as guest speaker at the Second World Congress on
 Religious Liberty in Rome. His leadership of Jamaica and
 support of basic human rights were cited as the reasons for
 the invitation.

 JAMAICA
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees Jamaican citizens freedom of
 movement throughout the country, the right to reside in any
 part of it, the right to enter, and immunity from expulsion.
 There are no national restrictions on foreign travel or
 emigration. Citizenship is not revoked for political reasons.
 Jamaica's central location in the Caribbean makes it a
 potential hub for illegal migrants and would-be refugees or
 asylum seekers. Consequently, Jamaica has avoided any
 declarative policy on refugees. As a party to the 1951 UN
 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, it honors its
 treaty obligations, dealing with refugees on a *case by case"
 basis. Jamaica's reasons for not accepting migrants are
 largely economic ones, and include high domestic unemployment.
 In recent years individuals from Cuba, Haiti, and Nicaragua
 have sought to settle and work in Jamaica, claiming to be
 'refugees.' Haitians are considered economic migrants, and
 most are returned to Haiti. In two recent cases, seven of the
 30 Cubah migrants who were granted de facto temporary status in
 1982 were permanently resettled in Canada. Of 17 Nicaraguan
 *boat people' who arrived in May 1983, only five now remain in
 temporary status in Jamaica.
 Section 3 Respect for Political'Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 In Jamaica, the Prime Minister, who is the leader of the
 majorit!1 party, and a cabinet made up of ministers appointed by
 him, constitute the executive power. The executive usually
 takes the initiative in legislative matters and is responsible
 to.the House of Represenatives. The position of the Leader of
 the Opposition is provided for under the Constitution.
 The Jamaican Constitution, in .common with those of many
 Commonwealth countries, requires that elections be held not
 later than five years from the first sitting of parliament.
 However, it also gives the Prime Minister with the right,
 within that period, to call an election whenever he sees fit.
 Within the multiparty political system, two main parties (The
 Jamaica Labour Party and People's National Party) have
 regularly alternated in power since the first elections under
 universal adult suffrage were held in 1944. The Jamaica Labor
 party came to power in November 1980 when it won a majority of
 seats'in the Uouse of Representatives. Other opposition
 groups, including the communists, operate freely, and no group
 is denied participation in the political process. The
 political system does not exclude ethnic groups or women.
 There.are no restrictions on nationality or citizenship status
 which limit participation in political life, and all citizens
 18 years of age and over are eligible to vote.
 In August 1983, a process of voter registration with
 photographs was begun throughout the island, in order to bring
 voting lists up to date and help protect the electoral process
 from fraud. However, the process was not complete when
 elections were called in December 1983. This was cited by the
 People's National party in explaining its decision to boycott
 the election.
 
 
 592
 JAMAICA
 AS a result of the boycott and the failure of any of the seven
 third-party candidates to be elected to the House, there is
 currently no official Leader of the Opposition. As the
 elected House, composed of 60 seats, is now under exclusive
 control of the members of the Jamaica Labour Party, Jamaica
 has a 'one-party house* but is not a *one-party state.' Mr.
 Michael Manley, leader of the People's National Party, has
 repeatedly claimed that the present Government is "bogus' and
 has no mandate to govern; he calls for new elections once
 voter registration is complete. However, the Government
 correctly points out that the 1983 election was held in strict
 conformity with the election law. Local elections, which were
 to have been held not later than June 1984, have been
 postponed. Tne Government claimed that revisions of the
 voters' list and other acts which were necessary for holding
 them would not be ready in time. Legislation was passed which
 would permit the Government to delay local elections up
 through June 1985.
 The present Government has taken steps to maintain a
 democratic complexion in the legislature. Procedures have
 been amended to enable any citizen having an interest in a
 matter under debate to make a presentation by appearing at the
 bar of the House. In the absence of a formal Leader of the
 Opposition in Parliament to nominate eight candidates as
 opposition senators, the Prime Minister has appointed eight
 independent senators who are fulfilling their roles-as active
 monitors and critics of government policy.
 Both major parties are committed to keeping parliamentary
 democracy alive under the unprecedented circumstance of a
 one-party makeup in the House.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Tnere has been little interest among international or
 non-governmental groups in investigating human rights in
 Jamaica. Freedom House in 1983 rated Jamaica as 'free.*
 Amnesty International expressed concern in its 1984 report
 over the continued use of the death penalty.
 Legislation on penal reform, comprising a corrections bill for
 prison reform and a criminal records bill, was tabled before
 Parliament in 1984.
 There are no restrictions on human rights organizations,
 several of which exist within the country. The Jamaica
 Council for Human Rights is the most active domestic human
 rights organization. The Council has continued to speak out
 about the large number of killings by the police, and demanded
 a public inquiry into such deaths.
 Jamaica is a member of several international bodies which
 protect human rights. The country is also a strong advocate of
 human rights in international forums, such as Caricom and the
 U.N. Jamaican leaders, including the present Prime Minister,
 have spoken before regional and other international bodies on
 behalf of human rights. A Jamaican is a judge on the Inter-
 American Court of Human Rights.

 JAMAICA
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Production of bauxite/alumina, Jamaica's principal export
 earner, remained depressed in 1983, but receipts from tourism
 increased as the number of visitors grew by 16.9 percent
 compared to 1982. Gross national product grew by 1.8 percent
 in 1983. Inflation rose by 16.7 percent, a significant
 increase after single digit rises in the two previous years.
 The employment rate fell only marginally in 1983 from 27.9
 percent in 1982 to 26.9 percent. Shortage of foreign exchange
 and budget cuts have left the Government with fewer resources
 to deal with pressing economic and social problems. The
 Government has given priority to maintaining the inflows of
 raw materials and capital goods needed to support Jamaica's
 private sector-oriented recovery program. While consumer
 imports have been cut and the currency devalued sharply, the
 Government is trying to limit the impact of these measures on
 the consumption of basic commodities by the poor, establishing
 the Food Security Plan, including a food stamp program, aimed
 at protecting the basic nutrition of the poor.
 Jamaica has a per capita gross national product of $1333
 (1982). There are, however, wide disparities in income
 levels. In October 1983, the unemployment rate for men over
 24 years of age was lower than 15 percent, while that for
 women over 24 was more than 30 percent. The rate for all
 workers over 24 years was slightly more than 15 percent
 whereas that for workers under 24 years was almost 50
 percent. The Government is seeking to reduce some of these
 disparities through a major agriculture program designed to
 increase production and employment in rural areas, job
 training programs for youth, and programs to assist
 individuals in starting their own business.
 The adult literacy rate in Jamaica is 97 percent, and there is
 nearly universal primary school enrollment. Jamaica's
 educational system is free but the rising cost of living has
 placed a financial strain on families, who must provide school
 books and uniforms.
 Jamaican women are accorded full equality under the
 Constitution, and the 1975 Employment Act guarantees equal pay
 for equal work. The legal status of women is reflected in the
 number of influential positions they hold in the civil service
 and the Government, including Minister of Education, Director
 of the Jamaica Information Service, and President of the
 Senate.
 Nevertheless, because of cultural and social values, women
 often suffer economic discrimination. This discrimination
 frequently occurs in hiring practices. Access to higher
 paying jobs and jobs outside traditional "female" areas is
 limited. Reportedly, women have no choice but to settle for
 accepted "woman's work" in service fields such as teachers,
 health care workers, and commercial workers (produce vendors,
 sales clerks, secretaries, and office clerks). The higher
 paying senior level positions in commercial areas are still
 predominantly held by men. The 1975 Act has helped to narrow
 the gap between men's and women's salaries, although
 disparities remain.
 Tne country's economic problems tend to affect women first
 because they generally work in the service sector, frequently
 
 
 594
 JAMAICA
 do not have sufficient seniority to avoid layoffs, and service
 jobs, especially in the public sector, are the first to be
 cut.
 Employment figures for October 1983 showed that women
 constituted 37.7 percent of the labor force as a whole, but
 they comprised 66.14 precent of the unemployed labor force.
 The Government has a number of programs to help women with the
 problems they face. Primary health care clinics provide
 pre-natal and post-natal care for mothers and their children.
 The National Family Planning Board organizes education
 programs in family planning, population, and family life. A
 new food stamp program includes special provisions for
 pregnant and lactating women and women whose income is below
 $50 a month. The Women's Bureau in the Ministry of Youth and
 Community Development, established in 1974, sponsors
 agricultural and technical training projects and centers to
 provide continuing education for pregnant women. The
 Government has announced plans to establish a national
 advisory committee for women's affairs. Meanwhile, family law
 reforms based on the Report of the Family Law Committee set up
 in 1975 have finally come before the House this year. These
 include inheritance provisions for the family and a
 dependent's bill. Jamaica is a multiracial society. No
 ethnic group has been subjected to systematic discrimination.
 Increasing crime and violence have been major social problems
 in Jamaica in recent years. Rising unemployment,
 urbanization, lessened respect for authority and the police
 force, overworked courts, and pressures on the security forces
 have contributed to the growing crime rate, despite the
 measures taken by successive Jamaican Governments to deal with
 the problem.
