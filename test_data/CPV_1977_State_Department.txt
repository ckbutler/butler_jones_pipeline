 CAPE VERDE
 Cape Verde is a single party republic, and does not
 yet have a constitution. Its basic laws are decreed
 by the Government and approved by the elected National
 Assembly. These laws incorporate Portuguese law (from
 post-revolution Portugal) with local modifications.
 During the colonial period, which ended in 1975, Cape
 Verde was spared much of the political repression common
 to other Portuguese colonies, and emerged at independence
 with traditional concepts of civil liberties and human
 rights basically intact. The Cape Verde government
 appears to be committed to upholding the basic rights
 and freedoms contained in the Universal Declaration
 of Human Rights, and it does not condone violations.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 There is freedom from torture.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been no reports of cruel, inhuman or degrad-
 ing treatment or punishment in Cape Verde, nor do we
 have reason to believe that such practices exist.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The absence of such capricious actions is the rule in
 Cape Verde. In June 1977, approximately 40 persons
 were arrested on the islands of Sao Vicente and Santo
 Antao for distributing anti-government pamphlets,
 attempting to provoke actions against the regime, and
 planning sabotage and the assassination of officials.
 Portuguese citizens involved in these activities
 were expelled to Portugal, reportedly following court
 hearings. The detainees have been guaranteed a public
 trial with right to defense counsel, but they have not
 yet appeared in court.

 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial, with proper counsel,
 is observed in Cape Verde.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 There are effective legal safeguards against arbitrary
 invasion of the home.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Cape Verdean government has taken positive action
 to implement programs and seek foreign assistance to
 fulfill basic needs. Because of a prolonged drought
 which has lasted for more than nine years, virtually
 all Cape Verdeans are poor. The government's steps
 to improve the lot of the poor majority by means of
 new programs in health, education, agriculture and
 irrigation have been recognized as practical and
 viable.
 3=- Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a.   Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 The freedoms of religion and assembly are generally
 respected, and church and civic organizations are
 active. A mass trade union organization is being
 created by Cape Verdean workers. Most of the nation's
 media is owned or controlled by the ruling party, and
 those media in private hands tend to exercise prudent
 restraint.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on these freedoms.

 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Cape Verde is a single-party state and opposition
 parties are not permitted. However, one need not be
 a member of the ruling party, the African Party for
 the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde
 (PAIGC), in order to hold elected or appointed office.
 A 56-member National Assembly was elected by universal
 suffrage in June 1975, and meets periodically to en-
 dorse laws drawn up by the Council of Ministers, which
 is chosen from among the members of the National
 Assembly.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There have been no requests for outside investigations.
 Cape Verde's response to any future requests would likely
 depend on the nature of the allegations and the reputa-
 tion of the organization requesting the investigation.
