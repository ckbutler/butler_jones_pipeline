 MAURITIUS
 Mauritius is a small, densely populated island country with a
 functioning parliamentary democracy modeled after that of
 Great Britain. It is governed by a prime minister, council of
 ministers, and legislative assembly. The Governor General,
 with largely ceremonial powers, represents Queen Elizabeth II,
 the titular Head of State. Elections at national and local
 levels take place at regular intervals. There are four major
 political parties, which reflect a wide range of ideological
 views, and several smaller parties. Executive power has
 changed hands twice in the last 6 years through fair and
 orderly elections supervised by an independent commission.
 Municipal elections in 1985 returned the main opposition party
 to power in Mauritius' five largest cities. Prime Minister
 Jugnauth's coalition had its mandate renewed in general
 elections in August 1987.
 Mauritius has no military forces and depends on the
 paramilitary 700-man Special Mobile Force and the 240-man
 Police Riot Unit for internal security. These forces, Under
 the command of the Commissioner of Police, are apolitical,
 well trained, and backed by a general duty police force of
 approximately 4,000 men.
 Mauritius has a mixed economy based on sugar production,
 tourism, and textiles, with a strong private sector. In 1987
 the economy continued its recovery, registering an estimated 5
 percent growth rate and creating some 20,000 jobs. Following
 the successful economic adjustment policies of 1982-1986, it
 was not necessary for Mauritius to renew its standby agreement
 with the International Monetary Fund. During 1987 Mauritius
 signed a $60 million structural adjustment loan with the World
 Bank and the African Development Bank.
 Mauritius has a good human rights record. Political and civil
 rights, including the freedoms of speech and press, are
 protected under the Mauritian Constitution and respected in
 practice. The August 30, 1987, elections for Parliament were
 preceded by intense campaigning, including regular public
 rallies. The Dangerous Drugs Act of 1986, which is aimed at
 curtailing drug use and trafficking, has led to large-scale
 arrests, convictions, and controversy over some of its
 provisions.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of government-inspired political
 killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance of persons for
 political causes.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and inhuman punishment are prohibited by law, and
 there were no reports of degrading treatment or punishment.
 The situation was exacerbated in 1987 by government efforts to
 
 
 MAURITIUS
 cope with increased narcotics trafficking. According to local
 press accounts, over 700 people were arrested during 1987 for
 possessing narcotics substances. Figures are not available
 for the number of those arrested who were subsequently
 imprisoned. The Government is sensitive to prison conditions
 and is publicly committed to their improvement.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 There have been no reports of arbitrary arrests or detentions
 since the early 1970's. Detained persons have the right to a
 judicial determination of the legality of their detention. In
 practice, this determination is usually made within 24 hours.
 Bail is commonly granted. The Supreme Court ruled invalid in
 1986 a'section of the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1986 which had
 provided for detention without bail for persons arrested under
 Clause 46 (2) of the Act.
 Exile is legally prohibited. The Constitution prohibits any
 form of forced or compulsory labor, and this prohibition is
 respected.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Mauritius' judicial system, modeled on that of Great Britain,
 consists of the Supreme Court, which has appellate powers, and
 a series of lower courts. Final appeal may be made to the
 Queen's Privy Council in the United Kingdom and is routinely
 made in the cases of death sentences. There are no political
 or military courts. The legal system has consistently provided
 fair, public trials to those charged with crimes. Defendants
 have the right to private or court-appointed counsel. The
 judiciary is also charged under the Constitution with ensuring
 that new laws are consistent with democratic practice.
 Commissions of inquiry are frequently established to examine
 various issues of social or political concern. The
 commissions, routinely chaired by distinguished jurists,
 conduct hearings, subpoena witnesses, and present their
 findings to the Government for corrective action when
 wrongdoing has been discovered. Commission proceedings are
 conducted in public and reported fully by the press. The
 findings, however, are conveyed to the Government in
 classified reports that are not routinely made public unless
 or until the Government decides to take action against an
 accused party. The Rault Commission on Narcotics played a key
 role in crystalizing public opinion to sustain a campaign
 against narcotics use and trafficking.
 The Dangerous Drugs Act, which includes a mandatory death
 sentence for any person convicted of importing dangerous
 drugs, has been'controversial. In its 1987 Report, Amnesty
 International noted that "unlike other serious offenses under
 Mauritian law, which are tried before a jury of nine citizens,
 the offense of importation under the ... Act is heard by a
 judge without jury."
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home is ensured by law and generally
 respected in practice. The search of personal property or
 premises is allowed only under clearly specified conditions by
 court order or by police decision if an illegal act is
 suspected. There have been reports from reliable sources that,
 
 
 192
 MAURITIUS
 the Government's intelligence apparatus occasionally opens
 mail and carries out surveillance of local opposition leaders
 and other major figures.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is protected by the Constitution
 and by local tradition. Sixteen privately owned daily,
 weekly, and monthly newspapers present varying political
 viewpoints and freely express partisan views. Newspapers are
 subject only to the legal constraints of libel laws. The
 Government owns the one television and two radio stations (one
 strictly educational), broadcasting in five languages. The
 television and radio are reasonably objective in news and
 entertainment presentation, although opposition politicians
 occasionally accuse the broadcasting corporation of political
 bias in its news coverage. Television and radio broadcasts
 are also easily received from the nearby island of Reunion (a
 French Department) and are not subject to interference by the
 Government. However, foreign satellite broadcasts or programs
 which are considered "controversial" are subject to approval
 by the Cabinet of Ministers before transmission on local
 television or radio.
 In October 1986, the Legislative Assembly amended the
 Mauritian Constitution with regard to drug traffickers and
 drug trafficking in Mauritius. The legislation increased the
 powers of any commission of inquiry to look into personal
 finances, including bank accounts; provided for fines of
 persons who refuse to testify; provided for fining a bank and
 revoking its license if it refuses to cooperate in a financial
 investigation; and provided for the seizure of all assets of
 convicted drug traffickers who cannot prove that their assets
 were obtained legally.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Mauritians enjoy the right to form associations, including
 political parties, trade unions, and religious organizations.
 Mauritius has a multitude of such private organizations.
 Political, cultural, and religious assemblies are
 commonplace. Although police permission is required for
 holding demonstrations and mass meetings, such permission is
 rarely refused. The registered political parties freely held
 large public rallies during the campaign for the August
 general elections.
 Mauritius has an active trade union movement. Almost 300
 unions represent 90,000 workers, more than one-fourth of the
 work force. Unions are free to organize workers in all
 sectors, including the Export Processing Zone (EPZ), which
 employs about 85,000 workers. Unions can press wage demands,
 establish ties to domestic political parties and international
 organizations, and address political issues. Three of the
 five trade union activists who ran in the August general
 elections were elected to the Legislative Assembly on the
 government slate. One leading federation actively supports
 the opposition party. The largest confederation, the
 Mauritian Labor Congress, is a member of the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions. In theory, unions have
 the right to strike. However, in labor disputes the Industrial
 
 
 193
 MAURITIUS
 Relations Act requires a prestrike, 21-day cooling-off period
 followed by binding arbitration, which has the effect of
 making most strikes illegal.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no official state religion in Mauritius. Hindus,
 Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, and others openly practice,
 teach, and proselytize for their religions without prejudice.
 All religious institutions receive state subsidies in
 proportion to their memberships. There is no state-sanctioned
 discrimination against any ethnic or religious community.
 d.. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on full freedom of movement within
 the country. Foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation are
 also unrestricted.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Mauritius is governed by a freely elected, unicameral
 Legislative Assembly, with executive direction coming from a
 Council of Ministers, currently headed by Prime Minister
 Anerood Jugnauth. The Governor General has the right to
 designate the person charged with forming a new government
 following parliamentary elections or a parliamentary crisis.
 Parliamentary, municipal, and village council elections are
 held at regular intervals. Voting and running for office are
 rights of all citizens 18 years of age and over. In the
 Legislative Assembly, 8 of the 70 members are appointed
 through a complex "best loser" system designed in part to
 ensure that all ethnic groups are adequately represented. The
 governing coalition consists of 3 parties and controls 46 of
 the 70 seats. Political parties often match the ethnicity or
 religion of their candidates to the composition of particular
 electoral constituencies.
 In the August parliamentary elections, 89 percent of the
 553,364 eligible voters cast ballots. Only 9,512 votes
 separated the winning and losing coalitions.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no known requests by international
 organizations to investigate human rights violations in
 Mauritius. Amnesty International maintains two branches in
 Mauritius. There are several local human rights groups which
 address the internal situation in Mauritius without
 governmental intrusion.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 While there is no evidence of official discrimination against
 any ethnic or religious group, there have been allegations
 that certain groups, including Muslims, are underrepresented
 in the civil service.
 Women in Mauritius participate in all types of political,
 business, and social activities, and a few hold important
 
 
 1914
 MAURITIUS
 positions. Nonetheless, traditional ethnic and religious
 attitudes prevent women from achieving true parity. For
 example, only 5 of 70 Members of Parliament and I of 19
 Ministers are women. The Government seeks to improve the
 status of women, and recent amendments to laws ranging from
 emigration to inheritance have removed sex discriminatory
 sections. An interministerial committee, headed by the one
 female Minister, has been active since 1985 in addressing
 remaining discriminatory elements in local laws and
 practices. Nevertheless, discriminatory laws and regulations
 remain, including prohibition against women serving on juries.
 Moreover, the illiteracy rate for women (20 percent in 1983)
 is about twice that of men. While women are highly sought for
 employment in manufacturing plants, they tend to occupy the
 less skilled and lower paid positions and are particularly
 susceptible to layoffs during economic downturns. The average
 industrial salary for women is about 50 percent that of men.
 The Minister for Labor and Industrial Relations, Women's
 Rights, and Family Welfare has indicated, however, that middle
 management training for women is one of her ministry's
 priorities.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Conditions of employment in Mauritius, including wage and
 leave conditions, are generally sufficient to provide an
 acceptable standard of living to workers in the agricultural,
 service, and manufacturing sectors. Government, private
 welfare groups, and labor unions serve as watchdogs on
 potential employer abuses.
 A maximum workweek of 45 hours is allowed, and children below
 the age of 14 cannot be legally employed, although scattered
 cases of child labor have been reported. The Government
 mandates minimum wage increases each year based on inflation.
 The current minimum wage for unskilled labor in the Export
 Processing Zone is $9 per week during the first year and $11
 per week thereafter.
 In 1987, effective July 1, the Government awarded a wage
 increase (12-60 percent) in the public service. Salary
 increases (10-15 percent) were also approved for the private
 sector, including the sugar industry and the EPZ. At the same
 time, the Government addressed the issue of ovettime work in
 the EPZ due to complaints that EPZ employers imposed long
 hours of overtime on employees--about 10 to 20 hours per week,
 making for a 55- to 65-hour workweek. The revised remuneration
 orders of July 1 stipulated that no employee would be required
 to perform extra hours of work in excess of 10 hours per week,
 except with his or her consent. In addition, new remuneration
 rates for overtime above the regular 45-hour week were
 introduced as follows: (I) for the first 10 hours at one and
 a half times the basic rate per hour, (II) for the next 5
 hours at twice the basic rate per hour, and (III) thereafter
 at three times the basic rate per hour. In addition to wages,
 the Government also increased the social benefits to various
 groups, including old age pensioners, unemployed, widows and
 orphans, and handicapped people.
