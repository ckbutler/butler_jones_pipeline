 ICELAND
 Iceland is a constitutional republic and a multiparty parliamentary democracy. Its
 people participate in high percentages in regular, fair, and free elections which de-
 termine the distribution of power among political parties and leaders.
 The civil and criminal justice systems offer equal protection to all. The nation has
 no indigenous military forces or political security apparatus.
 Iceland has a mixed, open economy, in which all of its citizens have the right to
 hold private properly.
 clanders have long been strong defenders of human rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Political and extrajudicial killings
 did not occur.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no instances of abductions or disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are pro-
 hibited by law and do not occur. Prison conditions are good but many prisons are
 antiquated, and controls on prisoners are lax. An increased frequency of escapes in
 1993, some involving violent offenders, led to a public outcry for prison reform. In
 response, the Justice Minister appointed a panel to recommend changes to existing
 
 
 918
 regulations. At year's end, the panel had not yet reported its findings. There were
 no reports of hysical mistreatment of prison inmates by prison officials or other
 inmates in 1993. Nutrition was adequate and medical care was available to pris-
 oners at all times, as was access by family members. Prison facilities were sanitary,
 and recreation was provided. Most of the few prisons we.e relatively full. Con-
 sequently, prisoners sometimes were put into temporary quarters, for a maximum
 of 2 months, before being relocated to permanent prison quarters. Conditions in
 temporary quarters generally were equivalent to those in permanent quarters. The
 Government permitted independent monitoring of prison conditions by a local mon-
 itoring group, Vernd (Protection).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Due process is provided by law and ob-
 served in practice. The Constitution states that any person arrested by the authori-
 ties must be brought before a judge without undue delay. The judge must rule with-
 in 24 hours whether the person is to be detained. Although the Constitution allows
 for bail, it is usually not imposed as a condition for release. A judge's ruling may
 be appealed immediately to a higher court.
 There is no specific legal limit on the maximum length of pretrial (investigative)
 detention, but it usually ranges from a few days up to as much as 6 rr-rnths, the
 latter in cases in which the detainee has appealed the sentence to the Supreme
 Court. Before July 1992, pretrial detention sentences were generally served in isola-
 tion. Subsequently, according to the new law, judges must rule specifically on the
 question of isolation. Court orders to hold prisoners incommunicado must be justi-
 fled by the need to preserve the integrity of a continuing investigation. All pretrial
 detention sentences may be appealed to the Supreme Court, which must return a
 ruling "as soon as possible." In practice, this generally means a few days. Preventive
 detention is not practiced.
 There were no allegations of arbitrary detention.
 There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Defendants have a right to be present at their
 own trials and are guaranteed the right to competent legal counsel of their own
 choosing. In cases in which defendants are unable to pay attorney's fees, the State
 assumes the cost. Defendants have the right to access to an attorney sufficiently in
 advance of the trial to prepare a defense. Defendants may confront witnesses and
 otherwise participate in public trials, which are fair and free from intimidation. De-
 fendants and their attorneys have access to government-held evidence relevant to
 their cases and enjoy a presumption of innocence. All defendants have the right to
 appeal. No groups are barred from testifying, and within reason all testimony is
 given the same weight. The courts are free of political control. Although the Min-
 istry of Justice administers the iower -ourt system, the Supreme Court guards its
 independence and fairness. Juries are not used, but multijudge panels are common,
 especially in the appeals process.
 A mnjor reform of the Icelandic judicial system, separating judicial and executive
 power in regional jurisdictions, was fully implemented in July 1992. The measure
 transfers all judicial authority for criminal and civil cases from local officials, who
 also served as chiefs of police, to newly established district courts. The reform was
 the direct result of an Icelander's complaint to the European Commission of Human
 Rights in which the complainant, charged with a traffic violation, argued that it was
 unjust for an official of the same agency which accused him to try him.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 the Constitution and in practice, there is deep respect for the autonomy and rights
 of individuals. A warrant from a court is required to enter a private house except
 in cases of hot pursuit. Arbitrary intrusions by official entities, political organiza-
 tions, or any other organized group into the private beliefs or personal liberties of
 individuals do not occur.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution expressly forbids censorship
 and other restrictions on the freedom of the press and freedom of individual expres-
 sion. Citizens and the media exercise these freedoms extensively. Iceland has a pub-
 lic broadcasting system, state television and radio, as well as private television and
 radio which broadcast a wide spectrum of views. All newspapers are privately
 owned.
 Academic freedom of expression is vigorously exercised.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to unarmed assembly, except when the police fear that such gatherings
 may cause riots. Plans for public meetings are virtually never rejected, ad the au-
 thorities rarely modify them. The Constitution provides citizens the right to join to-
 
 
 919
 gether formally or informally in associations without governmental authorization. A
 varied and wide spectrum of voluntary organizations plays a vital role in Icelandic
 politics and societ. zy.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Although the Lutheran Church is the established church
 and most citizens are nominally members, there is complete freedom for other
 faiths. Both Christian and non-Christian faiths are allowed to proselytize freely.
 They may maintain ties with and receive support from, coreligionists abroad.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Icelanders have freedom to travel at home and abroad, to emigrate, and
 to return at will. Iceland observes the provisions of the 1951 Geneva Convention Re-
 lating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. "Spontaneous" asylum seek-
 ers are usually required to return to the country of first asylum pending a Justice
 Ministry ruling on their application. Refugees are never compelIed to return to a
 country in which they would face persecution. The Icelandic Red Cross facilitates
 the social and economic integration of refugees and those granted residence permits
 on "humanitarian grounds.'
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The political system is an open, fully functioning, parliamentary democracy in
 which voters freely choose the members of the Althing (Parliament) who, in turn,
 enact the laws of the land and determine the composition of the Cabinet. Parliamen-
 tary elections are held at 4-year intervals unless the Althing dissolves, on request
 of the Prime Minister to the President or in the event of a no-confidence vote, before
 the end of its full term. Voting in elections and membership in political parties are
 open to all citizens 18 years of age or older. Althing candidates are selected in pri-
 mary elections and caucuses. Multimember districts and proportional representation
 increase the chances for minority points of view to be represented. In addition, there
 is a strong cultural insistence on having the views of all significant groups rep-
 resented in the Althing.
 However, Iceland's theoretically proportional system of representation is heavily
 weighted to favor sparsely populated rural districts over urban areas. Redistricting
 to reflect population shifts to the cities would reire parliamentary action, which,
 though proposed by some Members of Parliament (MP's)in 1993, was not taken.
 The center/right coalition Government was formed following national elections in
 April 1991. It consists of the Independence Party and the Social Democratic Party,
 with David Oddsson of the Independence Party as Prime Minister.
 Three of the four top governmental positions-the Chief Justice of the Supreme
 Court, President, and Speaker of the Althing-are occupied by women. The latter
 two positions are largely ceremo:iial. There is an active and influential feminist po-
 litical party, the Women's List, which elected 5 M.P.'s to Parliament in 1991 and
 received 8.3 percent of the vote.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights associations, including groups working in the interest of women,
 children, the disabled, and prisoners, are active in Iceland. Human rights issues are
 sometimes considered in the court system, generating amendments to existing law.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Iceland's ethnically homogeneous population is strongly egalitarian and oposed
 to discrimination regardless of whether it is based on race, sex, religion, disability,
 or other factors. Government legislation and practice reflect this attitude.
 Women.-Violence against women, both physical and mental, continued to occur
 at a comparatively low rate. The issue gradually received increased public attention,
 in great part through the efforts of the Women's List political movement, which
 raised it periodically in political debate. A public women's shelter in Rekjavik offers
 protection to approximately 370 women and 180 children per year, an increase of
 20 and 30 respectively from 1991. There is also a rape trauma center sponsored and
 operated by women's organizations. Both are financially supported by national and
 municipal governments and private contributions. Approximately 400 women and
 children (aged 3 to 70) annually seek assistance at the rape trauma center.
 Spokeswomen attributed most of the increase to enhanced public knowledge of the
 services provided at the centers. Approximately 50 percent of those who made use
 of the women's shelter cited alcohol abuse by their male partners as a factor contrib-
 uting to the violence they suffered. Counseling is available from social workers and
 lawyers at the shelter, and children can continue their schooling during their stay
 there.
 
 
 920
 Studies indicate that only a small percentage of cases involving domestic violence
 or sexual abu 3 (rape or attempted rape, sexual harassment) are reported to the po-
 lice. Women's organizations assert that both the state investigative police and the
 court system are hostile or indifferent to victims of domestic and sexual violence.
 Only two Icelandic citizens, both men, have been sentenced in cases involving
 spouse or child abuse in 1992 and 1993. Spokesmen for the state investigative police
 also have asserted that investigation of domestic violence is a waste of time for the
 police, who should concentrate their efforts on "more serious" crime. Women's orga-
 nizations claim that female victims after having accused men of domestic violence
 or sexual abuse, are often subjected to humiliating and degrading police interroga.
 tions The Reykjavik City Hospital emergency ward now has an all-female staff to
 care for rape victims, and the police have implemented a program to educate officers
 in correct interrogation procedures. Women's action groups still complain that
 judges do not hand out severe enough sentences for sexually related crimes. They
 cite as an example that convicted rapists receive, on the average, from 1 to 2 years
 in prison.
 Major economic and political institutions in Iceland remain male-dominated. On
 the basis of credible research, the Women's List asserts that, despite legislation re-
 quiring eual pay for equal work, Icelandic women do not receive pay equal to that
 of men. The party and other active women's organizations have iven this issue top
 priority. Studies of comparative wage scales consistently revealed an average dif-
 ference of 40 percent in the earnings of men and women in comparable jobs. Al-
 though approximately half of the difference might be explained by longer average
 working hours among men and their tendency to work more overtime, there was
 stll a 20-perent unexplained differential in the wages of men and women.
 Since 1991, complaints based on the equal rights law have been referred to a spe-
 cial committee established under the equal rights affairs office of the Ministry of
 Social Affairs. The committee has only advisory powers and can only make rec-
 ommendations to the employer that do not have the force of law. Only a few com-
 plaints have been made to the committee. Nonetheless, women's groups speculate
 that the numbers are much higher, but that women are reluctant to come forward
 with complaints in the small, intimate and traditionally stoic Icelandic society. An.
 other factor is that the largely male-led Icelandic labor unions have not actively sup-
 ported individual women who wish to exercise their right to sue.
 Children.-High respect for children's rights is reflected in Icelandic legislation
 and government policy as well as in social practices. Icelandic law guarantees ade-
 quate public day-care as part of the extensive "law of the child passed by the
 Althing in 1992. Children's play corners are to be found in every public building or
 waiting room. There are also high quality public playgrounds available throughout
 the country.
 People with Disabilities.-Disabled individuals are not subject to discrimination in
 employment, education, or p revision of other state services. The Government has
 legislated accessibility to public buildings for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers in Iceland make extensive use of the right
 to establish organizations, draw up their own constitutions and rules, choose their
 own leaders and policies, and publicize their views. The resulting-organizations are
 not controlled by the Government or any single political party. Unions take active
 part in Nordic, European, and international trade union bodies. With the exception
 of limited categories of workers in the public sector whose services are essential to
 public health or safety (e.g., air traffic controllers), unions have had and used the
 right to strike for many years, including in 1993. According to Organization for ELo-
 nomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) figures, 76 percent of all eligible w:rk-
 ers belong to unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There are no impedime-z& to
 union membership in law or in practice. Virtually all unions exercise their right to
 bargain collectively on wages, working conditions, and related issues. While -!nion
 membership is theoretically no longer obligatory, wage earners are required to pay
 union fees. The closed shop exists in some industries, established in contracts be-
 tween unions and employers. Frequently, the obligation is mutual; employern agree
 to hire only union members and, in return, wage earners agree not to work for em-
 ployers who are not members of employer organizations.
 A 12-month agreement between the central laber and management organizations
 that was reached with the assistance of government mediation in April 1992 for-
 mally expired on March 1, 1993. It continued to be observed in practice throughout
 negotiations in the spring of 1993 which resulted in a new comprehensiv, labor
 agreement signed on May 21. Wage earners did not receive any wage increases, but
 
 
 921
 low-income benefits, vacation, and December bonuses are to be paid. In conjunction
 with the agreement, the Government made a number of political and economic com-
 mitments, includingkeeping the value of the currency (krona) stable and lowering
 value-added taxes (VAT). The agreement expires on December 1, 1994. Labor courts
 effectively adjudicate disputes over labor contracts and over the rights and provi-
 sions guaranteed under the 1938 Act on Trade Unions and Industrial Disputes,
 which prohibits antiunion discrimination.
 By law, employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to rein-
 state workers fred for union activities, In practice, the charges are difficult to
 prove. In a recent case of a union activist working for the Seewright Corporation
 in Reykavik, the union wss unable to prove in court its suspicion that the employee
 had been fired for union activities, rather than as part of a series of recession-relat-
 ed layoffs.
 In June 1993, the European Court of Human Rights issued a ruling stating that
 the Icelandic Government had violated the 11th article of the Eurpean Human
 Rights Charter (concerning the right of free association) by obliging taxi drivers to
 be members of a union. The Althing is to consider amendments to Icelandic law to
 comply with this judgment.
 There are no export processing or other special economic zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Compulsory education legislation
 stipulates that children must attend school until the age of 16. The employment of
 children below the age of 16 in factories, on ships, and in other places that are haz-
 ardous or require hard labor is prohibited by law, and this prohibition is observed
 in practice. Children of 14 and 15 years of age may, however, be employed part-
 time or during school vacations in light, nonhazardous work; their work hours may
 not exceed the ordinary working hours of adults in the same occupation. The Occu-
 pational Safety and Health Administration enforces child labor regulations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Icelandic workers are protected by laws that
 effectively ensure their health and safety as well as provide for unemployment in-
 surance, paid vacations, pensions, and reasonable working conditions and hours.
 The standard legal workweek is 40 hours. Work time exceeding the standard 8-hour
 workday is defined as overtime and compensated accordingly. Workers are entitled
 to 10 hours of rest within each 24-hour period and 1 day off every week. Under spe-
 cial circumstances the 10-hour rest provision can be reduced to 8 and the 1 day
 off can be postponed by a week. In case of the latter, the worker has a right to 2
 additional hours off in the following week.
 Although there is no minimum wage law, union membership is so pervasive and
 effective that labor contracts, in effect, assure even the lowest paid workers a suffi-
 cient income for a decent standard of living. Health and safety standards are set
 by the Althing and administered and enforced by the Ministry of Social Affairs
 through its Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Food, shelter, health
 care, and education are guaranteed without discrimination to those lacking ade-
 quate income because they are too old, too young, sick, or otherwise disadvantaged.
