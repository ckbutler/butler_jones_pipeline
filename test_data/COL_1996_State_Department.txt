 COLOMBIA
 Colombia is a constitutional, multiparty democracy in which the Liberal and Con-
 servative parties have long dominated politics. President Ernesto Samper avoided
 pssible removal from office on June 13 when the House of Representatives voted
 that there was insufficient evidence to impeach him on charges that he knowingly
 accepted contributions from narcotics traffickers during his 1994 campaign. The on-
 going crisis diminished the President's moral authority to govern, but he vowed to
 complete his term of office through August 1998. The judiciary is largely independ-
 ent.
 Widespread internal armed conflict and rampant killings continued to overwhelm
 society. An estimated 10-15,000 full-time guerrillas organized in over 100 groups
 represented a growing challenge to government security forces-and exercised a de-
 gree of permanent influence in more than half of the country's municipalities. The
 major guerrilla groups showed no serious interest in peace talks. Some guerrilla
 groups continued to collaborate with narcotic traffickers, especially in rural regions
 in the eastern part of the country. Paramilitary forces played a major role in the
 internal conflict.
 The Ministry of Defense is responsible for internal security and oversees both the
 armed forces and the national police. The Department of Administrative Security
 (DAS), with broad intelligence gathering, law enforcement, and investigative author-
 ity, reports directly to the President. The armed forces and the police committed nu-
 merous, serious human rights abuses.
 Colombia has a mixed private and public sector economy. The Government contin-
 ued an economic liberalization program and the privatization of selected public in-
 dustries, although at a slower pace than in 1995. Crude petroleum rivaled coffee as
 the principal export; two new fields of as yet unverified size are expected to increase
 petroleum's importance to the economy. Narcotics traffickers controlled vast num-
 bers of enterprises, and Arug-related corruption exerted enormous influence
 throughout society and political life.
 The Government took some steps to reduce human rights violations, but its over-
 all human rights record remainedpor. Athough extrajudicial killings by the secu-
 rity force declined somewhat, the armed forces and the plice continued to be re-
 sponsible for serious abuses including, according to credible reports, instances of
 death squad activity within the army. Such killings specifically attributed by credi-
 ble nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) to government security forces declined
 
 
 by approximately 11 percent in the first 9 months of the year, compared with the
 same period in 1995. With notable exceptions, the security forces generally exercised
 restraint in dealing with protesters. However, soldiers reportedly killed several mili-
 tant coca farmers and field workers ("cocaleros") and injured hundreds who-sup-
 ported in part by guerrillas and narcotics traffickers-were seeking to impede
 antinarcotics programs in the south in August; guerrillas also were responsible for
 some of the deaths. Security forces were responsible for dozens of disappearances.
 Police and soldiers continued to torture and beat detainees. Prison conditions are
 generally harsh. Arbitrary arrest and detention, as well as prolonged pretrial deten-
 tion, are problems. The judiciary is severely overburdened, and has a huge case
 backlog estimated at over 1 million cases. The use of "faceless" prosecutors, judges,
 and witnesses, under cover of anonymity for security reasons, continued.
 The independent Prosecutor General's office achieved a record number of human
 rights indictments and arrests, including that of a retired three-star general How-
 ever, in many instances including that of the general, the Prosecutor General's office
 was subsequently compelled to transfer the cases to the military justice system,
 which has establisheda  almost unbroken record of impunity. The Government al-
 lows the military to exercise primary jurisdiction over military personnel accused of
 abuses; the most prevalent form of sanction is informal dismissal from the service
 without benefit of court-martiaL Moreover, the Government's early, high priority on
 human rights became a casualty of the crisis over contributions by drug traffickers
 to the President's election campaign.
 Rampant impunity is at the core of the country's human rights violations. Accord-
 ing to government reports, in from 97 to 99.5 percent of all crimes, the lawbreakers
 are never brought to justice. Victims never even report an estimated 74 percent of
 all crimes to the authorities. The Prosecutor General's office, however, increased ef-
 forts to prosecute high-profile human rights cases involving grave violations such as
 massacres and forced disappearances committed by government forces, paramilitary
 groups, and guerrillas. While the National Human Rights Ombudsman confirmed
 that documented cases of security force abuse had declined, he cautioned that the
 situation remained critical. At the Government's request, the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Human Rights agreed to open a field office in early 1997.
 The Samper administration has not taken action to curb increased abuses com-
 mitted by paramilitary groups, verging on a policy of tacit acquiescence. Even in
 areas where they had heavy influence, the armed forces seldom restrained para-
 military activity and abuses.
 For 36 of the past 44 years, including much of 1996, the Government has operated
 under declared states of emergency that enabled the executive to rule by decree in
 broad areas of the country. The decrees frequently limited due process rights and
 freedom of movement. The Government created special public order zones to per-
 mit military commanders in areas of high conflict to direct all government security
 efforts--including, with authorization by the elected governor or president, imposing
 curfews, check-points, and requiring safe conduct passes. A Samper administration
 reform proposal to expand presidential emergency decree powers and remove dec-
 larations of states of emergency from oversight by the Constitutional Court moved
 forward in Congress, and debate on the proposal was scheduled to resume in 1997.
 The presence of paramilitary, guerrilla, and narcotics trafficking organizations, and
 the armed confrontations among them, as well as with the armed forces, has dis-
 placed 70,000 persons; this total increased by 25 percent compared with 1995.
 The Government increased pressure on the media to influence reporting, and in
 December, the President signed a bill that is expected to lead to intrusive, partisan
 censorship of television newscasts. Violence against women and children is a serious
 problem. Unofficial but extensive discrimination against women, minorities, and the
 indigenous continued. Child labor is a widespread problem. Vigilante groups that
 engaged in "social cleansing-the killing of street children, prostitutes, homo-
 sexuals, and others deemed socially undesirable-sontinued to be a serious problem.
 Guerrilla forces continued to be respnsile for numerous killings and disappear-
 ances, as well as 30 to 50 percent of all kidnapings. The Revolutionary Armed
 Forces of Colombia (FARo) guerrilla group showed no interest in releasing three
 American missionaries whom the FARC kidnaped on January 31, 1993. According
 to credible NGO sources, during the ist 9 months of the year, members of para-
 military groups committed 59 percent of politically motivated extrajudicial killings;
 guerrillas were responsible for 33 percent; and government forces for 8 percent of
 them.     m
 
 
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Etrajudicial Killing.-Political and extrajudicial killing
 continued to be a serious problem. Members of the security forces continued to com-
 mit extra*udicial killings, at a somewhat reduced rate. According to the Bogota-
 based NE Itercongregational Justice and Peace Commission and the Center for
 Investigation and Popular Education (CINEP), the security forces were responsible
 for about 8 percent of political murders in which the perpetrators could be identi-
 fied. This represented a decline from the 16 percent reported for the same period
 in 1995. However, this marked a small drop in absolute numbers, from 55 to 49,
 due to generally escalated violence throughout the country. A study by the Colom-
 bian Commission of Jurists (CCJ) also indicated a downward trend in security force
 abuses. CCJ reported that in 1995, agents of the State committed 16 percent of po-
 litical killings, forced disappearances, and social cleansing operations in which per-
 petrators could be generically identified, compared with 54 percent in 1993. Prelimi-
 nary figures for 1996 indicate a continuation of this trend, with 18 percent of abuses
 attributed to the security forces.
 According to its 1996 report, the independent, state-sponsored Defensoria del
 Pueblo (National Human Rights Ombudsman) received 219 complaints in 1995
 against the army alleging murder, forced disappearances, and threats. The same re-
 port cited 169 complaints against the police for murder, disappearances, and
 threats. The Ombudsman's figures for 1996 are not yet available, but he praised the
 police for substantially improving their human rights record. The Attorney General's
 office reported that o the 3  complaints against public officials received between
 June 1995 and October 1996 (some of which occurred before that reporting period),
 it opened proceedings in 1,338 cases, including 28 massacres and 202 homicides.
 Some of the other cases did not involve public officials and were passed on to other
 overnment investigative bodies. Government officials give credence to reports of
 Isolated death squadi activity by at least one army unit, the 20th Intelligence Bri-
 gade.Although security forces generally exercised restraint in dealing with protesters,
 soldiers reportedly killed several militant coca farmers and field workers and in-
 jured hundreds in August (see Section 2.b.).
 While security force killings declined slightly, killings by paramilitary forces in-
 creased, and killings by guerrillas and narcotics traffickers also continued to be a
 serous problem. According to the Institute of Legal Medicine, there were 25,274
 murders in 1995, down from 26,764 in 1994. The Institute reported an average of
 77.4 violent deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. The National Police reported that
 12,824 citizens were victims of homicide during the first 6 months of 1996, down
 from 13,001 during the last 6 months of 1995.
 The police and the judiciary have insufficient resources to investigate most
 killings adequately. In June the Superior Council of the Judiciary reported that 74
 percent of all crimes go unreported, and between 97 and 98 percent of all crimes
 go unpunished. The government commission on public spending placed the impunity
 rate or all crimes at 99.5 percent. Although data were lacking in a majority of mur-
 der cases, the CCJ study estimated that the kilers targeted 4 out of every 10 mur-
 der victims for their involvement with political, labor, or social causes.
 The CCJ study also indicated that as the number of political killings and forced
 disappearances carried out by members of the armed forces and police decreased
 since 1993, those committed by paramilitary organizations increased. In cases of po-
 litical killings, forced disappearances, and social cleansing during 1995 in which per-
 petrators could be generically identified, the CCJ concluded that paramilitary mem-
 hers committed 46 perent of those offenses, compared with 18 percent in 1993; and
 that guerrilla organizations committed 38 percent of those offenses, compared with
 28 percent in 1993. Preliminary figures or 1996 indicate a continuation of this
 trend, with 4s percent attributed to paramilitary organizations and 38 percent to
 guerrilla organizationsfrom October 1995 through March. The CCJ claimed the im-
 punity rate for politically motivated crimes is virtually 100 percent.
 Another source came to a similar finding. Combined data collected by the Justice
 and Peace Commission and CINEP showed evidence sufficient to esblish a prob-
 able perpetrator in 582 extrajudicial killings (including unresolved forced disappear-
 ances) known or presumed to be politically motivated during the first 9 months of
 1996, compared with 342 politicsl murders dui g the first 9 months of 1995. Of
 the perpetrators generically identified in 1996, 6 percent were military, 2 percent
 were police, 59 percent were members of paramitary groups, and 33 percent were
 guerrillas. In absolute numbers, extrajudicial killings attributed to the military and
 police dropped slightly (55 to 49), representing 8 percent of such killings compared
 
 
 392
 to 16 percent in 1995, even though the overall level of violence escalated. Comparing
 January through September for 1995 and 1996 respectively, paramilitary killings
 (334 in 1996- 164 in 1995) increased from 48 percent to 59 percent of the total, while
 guerrilla killing (189 in 1996; 123 in 1995) accounted for 33 percent of the total,
 down slightly rm 36 percent in 1995. Thus both paramilitary and guerrilla killings
 increased significantly in absolute numbers during the months of January throug
 September. The CINEP, the Justice and Peace Commission, and the CCJ caution,
 however, that these relative comparisons could change significantly if all the per-
 petrators could be identified. They agree that the statistics represent rough approxi-
 mations which at beat point to general trends.
 Human rights monitors reported continued incidents of social cleansing-includ-
 ing attacks and killings--dirkted against individuals deemed socially undesirable
 such as drug addicts, prostitutes, transvestites, beggars, and street children. The
 Justice and Peace Commission reported 60 cases of social cleansing during the
 months of January through June; it attributed 22 of those cases to members of para-
 military or private justice  oups. In the remaining cases, a likely perpetrator could
 not be identified. (During the same time period in 1995 Justice and Peace reported
 71 cases of social cleansing, and attributed 15 to the police, 6 to paramilitaries, and
 12 to the guerrillas.) The Attorney General reported one case under investigation
 that may have involved a state security agent. The regional prosecutor in Medellin
 had a former policeman under investigation for participation in a social cleansing
 group and other crimes.
 Killings by paramiitaiy groups inreased s"~gficantly, often with the alleged
 complicity of individual soldiers or of entire military units and with the knowledge
 and tacit approval of senior military officials. The groups targeted teachers, labor
 leaders, community activists, mayors of towns and villages, town council members,
 and, ao    all peasants. Many of these victims included members of indigenous
 communities.  The Ombudsman reported that despite a 60 percent increase in var-
 ious forms of paramilitary activitZy sine 1992, the miitary failed to give priority to
 confronting those illicit groups. Whether organizedas dr  traffickers' private ar-
 mies or landowners' private defense groups in response to kdnaping threats and ex-
 tortion demands, these illegal groups reportedly killed suspected guerrilla members
 and supporters on sight as normal operating rocedure.
 Allegations of cooperation by members of the armed forces with paramilitary
 groups, including tacit support and direct collaboration by members of the armed
 forces, in particular the army, continued to generate controversy. The army com-
 mander categorically denied the charge that such cooperation existed, but informed
 observers reported that tacit arrangements between local military commanders and
 paramilitary groups did occur in some regions. Both government human rights advo-
 cates and academics reported that paramilitary groups freely operated in some
 areas that were under military control. As paramilitary violence surged in Novem-
 ber and December, the Government offered a reward of over $1 million (1 billion
 pesos) for the capture of paramilitary leader Carlos Castano. Belatedly, the army
 sent special troops to Sucre department, one of the regions most affected by para-
 military attacks. Concrete results of the Government's efforts by year's end could
 not be measured.
 The Ombudsman and the Prosecutor General's office agreed that some cases show
 that some members of the armed forces have collaborated with paramilitary groups.
 The prosecutor ordered the arrest of an army captain and a paramilitary leader im-
 plicated in the April massacre of 15 persons in the town of Segovia. It also ordered
 the arrest of retired three-star army General Farouk Yanine, who voluntarily re-
 turned to Colombia to face charges of having supported paramilitary groups in the
 mid to late 1980's. He is accused of implementing a strategy to have paramilitary
 groups carry out counterguerrilla activities the army was prohibiting from doin,
 and with having had knowledge of the 1987 massacre by paramilitaries of 19 civi -
 ians suspected of aiding guerrillas. In November the Superior Council of the Judici-
 ary transferred the case to the military justice system. While acquiescing to the
 Council's ruling, the civilian Prosecutor General demurred that formation of a para-
 military group did not constitute an act of service. General Yanine remained under
 detention but as yet unindicted while the investigation continued as of year's end.
 Although most paramilitary killings remain unsolved, in June the regional pros-
 ecutor in Bogota indicted 185 members of paramilitary groups active in the
 Magdalena Medio region since 1991. The Prosecutor General's human rights unit
 conducted a broad investigation into the paramilitary groups active in this region
 since the 1980's. The investigation included extensive testimony of an imprisoned
 paramilitary member (and former guerrilla) implicated in at least 200 crimes and
 the deaths of as many as 700 people. In addition to General Yanine, the prosecutor
 arrested an army colonel and a sergeant and issued a warrant for an army major.
 
 
 393
 In the case of all four suspects, the Superior Council of the Judiciary transferred
 *urisdiction to the mlitary justice system. However, paramilitary leaders such as
 known drug traffickers Fidel and Caroe Castano and emerald magnate Victor
 Carranza remained beyond the reach of justice.
 The Ombudsman attributed the majority of massacres committed in Uraba, Cesar,
 Cordoba, Magdalena Medio, and the eastern plains to paramilitary groups. Of the
 1,379 politica murders and 323 disappearances registered by the Permanent Com-
 mittee for the Defense of Human Rights from January throu  August, the commit-
 tee likewise attributed a majority to paramiitary groups and paid killers. The com-
 mittee cautioned that these totals could rise by 30 to 40 percent if statistics gath-
 ered by other NGO's were taken into account.
 The leftist coalition party known as the Patriotic Union (UP) continued to be the
 target of political killing. It has lost approximately 3,500 members in what the UP
 erceived as a campaign of targeted killings waged against its leadership over the
 ast 11 years. There were 600 reported murders of UP members in Meta department
 alone since the campaign began, including the head of the Meta Committee for
 Human Rights, Josue Giraldo, who was killed in October. The Inter-American Com-
 mission on Human Rights (IACHR) adopted a resolution requesting the Government
 to prosecute anyone taeting human rights advocates for murder and to rovide
 protection for Galdo'fmiy. In May, Aida Abella, national head of the UP and
 Bogota city council member, was nearly killed in an attack by unknown persons.
 The UP brought a complaint before the IACHR that charges the Government with
 "action or omission" in what the UP terms "political genocide" against the UP and
 the Communist Party. In its October submission to the IACHR, the human rights
 organization Fundacion Reiniciar reported that, between January 1 and September
 20, UP activists were killed at the rate of one every other day. Many murdered UP
 members held or had previously held elected office: 1 regional deputy, 13 municipal
 council members, 2 former mayors, and 3 former council members. UP leader
 Hernan Motta is the party's member of the Senate, replacing UP leader Manuel
 Vargas Cepeda who was killed in 1994. An investigation of two army colonels and
 two army sergeants implicated in his murder was still underway at year's end. A
 court sentenced the murderers of UP leader Jaime Pardo Leal to prison nearly 10
 years after his killing.
 In Cesar department, paramilitary enforcers violently displaced peasants from
 land on the Hacienda Bel&cruz in a land dispute in which the national Government
 had ruled in favor of the peasants. On September 28, paramilitary members killed
 Eliseo Narvaez, one of the peasant leaders and negotiators, and his brother Eder,
 bringing to 15 the number of small farmers killed in this dispute since January, ac-
 cording to a report by the National Association of Peasants for Unity and Recon-
 struction. NGO s cite this case as an example of the entral Government's inability
 or lack of will to enforce the law in the face of deadly paramilitary force.
 Overall, paramilitary killings escalated not only in all of the areas which in 1995
 suffered the greatest concentration of violence, such as Meta, Uraba, Cordoba and
 Cesar, but in other regions as well, including Sucre, parts of Antioquia beyond
 Uraba, Magdalena Medio, and Putumayo. This increase reflects the intensified com-
 petition between paramilitary and guerrilla organizations for control across a broad
 sweep of territory (see Section 1.g.). The victims of paramilitary killings, however,
 were overwhelmingly unarmed, noncombatant civilians whose summary murders
 the paramilitary forces rationalized as punishment for possible ties to the guerrillas.
 In January unknown assailants shot and killed Marta Elena Sanchez, director of
 Palmira prison outside Call. Other unknown assailants killed Miraflores mayor
 Mauro Restrepo Oliveros that month. In June FARC guerrillas allegedly were re-
 sponsible for killing the governor of Caqueta department, Jesus Angel Gonzalez.
 There was some progress in the case of the 1995 murder of American missionaries
 Timothy Van Dyke and Steven Walsh. The authorities identified the FARC com-
 manders responsible for these killings and issued warrants for their arrest; how-
 ever, they were not in custody at years end (see Section i.e.).
 b. Disappearance.-Colombia continued to suffer from extremely high overall rates
 of disappearance and kidnaping. In July the private foundation Pais Libre and the
 directorate for the Government's special antikidnaping task forces reported 557
 kidnapings during the first half f the year. They estimated that this represented
 only onehal the actual total because many families of kidnaping victims chose not
 to report kidnapings in order to conceal ransom negotiations. A U.S. security con-
 sulting firm estimated an annual total of 3,500 kidnapings.
 The law codifies kidnaping for extortion and "simple kidnaping" as crimes. Efforts
 to identifr the act of forced disappearance as a crime have not been successful, how-
 ever, in part because the military justice system may treat forced disappearances
 as acts performed in the line of duty. By October the Attorney General or Human
 
 
 394
 Rights reported 40 forced disappearances attributed to members of the armed forces,
 police, and the DAS. NGO's reported several cases of forced disappearances alleg-
 edly committed by government forces during the coca cultivators protests of July
 and August.
 Guerrillas were responsible for between 30 and 50 percent of all kidnapings. They
 continued to deny, implausibly, that their practice of kidnaping constitutes common
 criminal extortion. Arrests or prosecutions in any of these cases were rare. Foreign-
 ers were attractive targets for kidnaping by both the FARC and the ELN, which
 generally demanded exorbitant ransom payments for their release.
 In April members of an ELN splinter group known as JEGA (Jorge Eliecer Gaitan
 Alianza) kidnaped Juan Carlos Gaviria, brother of former Colombian president and
 current OAS Secretary General Cesar Gaviria. JEGA issued a number of incoherent
 demands for political concessions during the 2 ensuing months, but in June his cap-
 tors released Gaviria in return for safe conduct to Cuba. This case generated consid-
 erable controversy because it represented a departure from government policy not
 to grant concessions to kidnapers.
 In July the paramilitary group headed by Fidl and Carlos Castano began a retal-
 iation campalga of kidnapings, targeting relatives of FARC and ELN leaders. In Oc-
 tobr the Costa Rican Government granted refuge to 20 threatened guerrilla family
 members at the petition of the UN. High Commissioner for Refugees and the Red
 Cross. Interior Minister Horacio Serpa played a key role in convincing the Costa
 Rican Government to accept the guerrillas' relatives. As in the Gaviria case, Serpa's
 intervention marked a departure from the Government's handling of other
 kidnapings.
 A guerrillas kidnaped American missionaries David Mankins, Mark Rich and
 Rick Tenenoff near the border with Panama on January 31 1993. Mankins, kich,
 and Tenenoff along with their wives and families were members of the New Tribes
 Mission (NTM) at the time of their kidnaping. For more than 2 years, the FARC
 has failed to discuss the release of the three missionaries, despite numerous efforts
 by NTM representatives to contact the FARC.
 The Prosecutor General's human rights unit continued its investigation of the
 1987 forced disappearance, torture, and murder of Nydia Erika Bautista, a member
 of the April 19th Movement, or M-19. However, in December the Superior Council
 of the Judiciary transferred this case to the military justice system. In October the
 Administrative Tribunal of Cundinamarca ruled that the Government was respon-
 sible for the 1990 disappearance of human rights activist Alirio de Jesus Pedraza
 and ordered that his family receive financial indemnification.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture, but reports of incideats o police and military beatings
 and torture of detainees continued. There was no appreciable decrease in cases of
 torture committed by individuals from various government security agencies. The
 Attorney General for Human Rights reported investigating 462 cases of torture com-
 mitted by the police, DAS, army, prison officials, and other agents of the State dur-
 ing the period from June 1995 to October 1996. These abuses often occurred in con-
 nection  with  illegal detentions  in  the  context of counterinsurgency  or
 counternarcotics operations. In August soldiers beat a cameraman because he had
 filmed them beating an unarmed civilian during a protest by coca growers and har-
 vesters (see Section 2.a.). Paramilitary groups operating in rural areas were also re-
 prtedly responsible for many instances of torture, which, however, cannot be docu-
 mented. In cases of extrajudicial killings, the authorities rarely sent bodies that
 bore the traces of physical torture for extensive forensic investigation.
 Prison conditions are generally harsh, especially for those prisoners without sig-
 nificant outside support. Overcrowding and dangerous sanitary and health condi-
 tions remained a serious problem. Local or regional commanders do not always pre-
 pare mandatory detention registers or follow notification procedures, and as a re-
 sult, accurate detainee counts do not exist.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) continued to have access
 to most prisons and police and military detention centers.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution includes several provi-
 sions designed to prevent illegal detention; however, the authorities continued to ar-
 rest and detain citizens arbitrarily.
 Suspects must be brought before a judge within 36 hours of theirarrest, and they
 have a right to petition for habeas corpus from any judge. The judge must act upon
 that petition within 36 hours of its application. Despite these legal protections, in-
 stanes of arbitrary detention continued, and a sigmficant percentage of the prison
 population remained in an undetermined pretrial status. Justice and Peace received
 598 reports of arbitrary detentions during the first 6 months of the year, a number
 far higher than the Ombudsman's full-year count of 374 illegal or arbitrary arrests
 
 
 395
 in 1995. Although the Ombudsman's 1996 figures were not yet available, a similar
 discrepancy with the NGO's was likely because of different reporting criteria.
 The state of emergency permits preventive detention with or without prior judicial
 authorization but requires the authorities to bring detainees before a judicial officer
 within 36 hours of arrest. Although the authorities were able to increase the num-
 ber of arrests, in many cases they failed to bring the detainees before the judicial
 authorities within the required time. Citizens were thus often held without formal
 justification before eventually being released. The Government failed to anticipate
 the impact which its declarations of states of emergency would have on an overbur-
 dened judicial system that could not address the needs of citizens even under nor-
 mal circumstances.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial system, reorganized under the 1991
 Constitution, is largely independent of the executive and legislative branches, both
 in theory and practice.
 The judiciary includes the Constitutional Court, Supreme Court of Justice, the
 Council of State, the Higher Judiciary Council, tribunals, and courts. The 1991 Con-
 stitution modified the structure of the judicial branch by creating the Office of the
 Prosecutor General as an independent prosecutorial body.
 The judiciary has long been subject to threats and intimidation when dealing with
 cases againt members of paramilitary, guerrilla, and narcotics organizations. Al-
 though violent attacks against prosecutors and judges dropped with the decline in
 drug-relatd terrorism in the late 1980's (and as extradition of Colombian citizens
 was halted in 1991), prosecutors, judges, and defense attorneys are still subject to
 threats and acts of violene. In August alleged ELN guerrllas abducted and killed
 Pedro Alfonso Marquez, director o the prosecutor's office of investigations in La
 Guajira department. In February a member of the Attorney General's office des-
 ignatd to investigate corruption among government intelligence services was killed
 with her husband in what appeared to be a contract murder, although no direct link
 to her work could be established. A civil municipal judge was killer in Cali in Au-
 gust. Other victims included prosecuting attorneys, investigators working on their
 cases, as well as other employees of courts andprosecutors' offices. Justice and
 Peace received reports of seven attorneys murdered for political reasons during the
 first 6 months of the year.
 The Constitution specifically provides for the right to due process. The accused
 has the right to representation by counsel, although representation for the indige-
 nous and the indigent historically has been inadequate. The Government continued
 to labor under staffing and funding shortages in an effort to develop a credible pub-
 lic defender system. As in past years, the judiciary remained overburdened and
 often in a state of chaos, staggering under a backlog estimated at over 1 million
 cases.
 The system of justice incorporates regional or public order jurisdictions to pros-
 ecute cases involving the crimes of narcotics trafficking, terrorism, kidnaping, sub-
 version, and extortion. In these courts, faceless prosecutors, judges, witnesses, and
 attorneys act under cover of anonymity for security reasons. The Government in-
 tends to end the system of regional jurisdictions in 1999. Human rights groups con-
 tinued to charge that this system violates basic legal norms and procedural rights,
 and the Prosecutor General agreed that these cases needed stricter controls and lim-
 its. While a late 1993 reform of the Criminal Procedures Code addressed certain
 Frocedural shortcomings within the system, problems remained. It was still difficult
 or defense attorneys to impeach or cross-examine anonymous witnesses, and often
 they did not have unimpeded access to the State's evidence. As a result of such con-
 cerns, judges may no longer base a conviction solely on the testimony of an anony-
 mous witness. Prosecutors, judges and witnesses generally maintained, however
 that the protection of anonymity tat is provided by a faceless system is essential
 to the successful investigation and prosecution of human rights cases in a country
 were violence is endemic and acts of revenge against those prosecuting violent crime
 may be expected.
 Human rights groups also criticized the Government's policy of allowing major
 narcotics traffickers to surrender voluntarily and negotiate their sentences. These
 critics charged that lower-income defendants were at a disadvantage under the sys-
 tem, while powerful criminals received deferential treatment. They also charged
 that the system, lacking resources, could not effectively prosecute the major guer-
 rilla leaders and was left to handle only low-level criminals suspected of subversive
 activity. Prosecutors reported, moreover, that potential witnesses in major cases
 often lacked faith in the Government's ability to protect their anonymity and were
 unwilling to testify.
 
 
 396
 The Attorney General's office is part of the Public Ministry. It investigates mis-
 conduct by public officials and orders administrative sanctions as applicable. The
 Attorney General for Human Rights investigates some allegations of -uman rights
 abuses by members of the state security apparatus, drawing upon a network of gov-
 ernment human rights ombudsmen covering over 1,000 municipalities. The office of
 the human rights Ombudsman has the constitutional duty to ensure the promotion
 and exercise of human rights, but it is severely underfunded. In addition to provid-
 ing public defense attorneys in criminal cases, the Ombudsman's offices throughout
 the country provide a legal channel for thousands of complaints and allegations of
 human rights violations. The new Ombudsman, who took office on August 30, re-
 ported that his office needed a minimum of 2,000 public defenders to fulfill its con-
 stitutional duty. By year's end, however, there were only 500 public defenders.
 Moreover, the budget the Finance Ministry presented to Congress fell significantly
 short of the Ombudsman's basic requirements to cover staffing and technical infra-
 structure
 The Prosecutor General's specially designated human rights unit achieved major
 results in 1996. Under the direction of a coordinating prosecutor and supported 1by
 a team of investigators, this group of 25 faceless prosecutors addressed approxi-
 mately 100 cases involving massacres, extrajudicial killings, kidnapings and forced
 disappearances. They issued numerous arrest warrants against members of the
 armed forces, paramilitary groups, guerrilla organizations, and drug trafficking or-
 ganizations and had successfully arrested some of those suspects by years end (see
 Section L.a.). For the first time, the authorities ordered the arrest of a retired three-
 star general, Farouk Yanine, alleged to have supported paramilitary activity in
 Magdalena Medio region. The unit also ordered the arrest of an army colonel on
 similar charges. In addition, the unit identified and issued arrest warrants for the
 PARC commanders responsible for the June 1995 murders of FARC-abducted Amer-
 ican missionaries Timothy Van Dyke and Steve Welsh. In another major case, the
 authorities arrested an army major and a paramilitary leader on charges of complic-
 ity in the April massacre of 15 civilians in the city of Segovia, Antioquia depart-
 ment. Although top military leaders hailed the cases brought against guerrilla lead-
 ers, they strongly objected, and in some cases tried to obstruct, prosecution of cases
 against members of the armed forces and of paramilitary organizations. Decisions
 by the Superior Council of the Judiciary in November and December to transfer cer-
 tain key cases to military courts suggested a reversal of its position on military ver-
 sus civilian jurisdiction earlier in the year and aroused concern that additional cases
 involving allegations of militay collaboration with paramilitary organizations would
 likewise be passed on to the military courts.
 Faceless prosecutors handle most cases involving criminal violations of human
 rights with caseloads that commonly exceed 100. In March a faceless judge sen-
 tenced four persons to a total of 114 years and 5 months for the 1994 massacre of
 20 members of the indigenous Guataba community in Caloto, Cauca department.
 The Government states that it does not hold political prisoners. However, the
 ICRC reported that it monitored approximately 2,000 cases of citizens imprisoned
 under accusations of rebellion or aiding and abetting the insurgency, which are pun-
 ishable under law. Critics charge that prisoners held under suspicion of collabora-
 tion with guerrillas are detained for political reasons. Many of these prisoners were
 noncombatants who in some cases were held for months during preliminary proceed-
 ings before their cases could be dismissed.
 . Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 generally requires a judicial order for authorities to enter a private home, except
 in cases of hot pursuit. In remote regions, the military forces have civilian prosecu-
 torial units attached to them. Some human rights groups charged that these at-
 tached units were unconstitutional, and Congress has so far refused to grant them
 permanent status. To address this problem, the Ministry of Defense continued train-
 ing in legal search procedures that comply with constitutional and human rights.
 A judicial order is likewise required to authorize telephone monitoring and the
 interception of mail. This protection extends to prisoners held in jails. However, var-
 ious state authorities monitor telephones without obtaining authorization.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal
 ConflictsThe internal armed conflict and narcotics trafficking are the central causes
 of violations of human rights and humanitarian law. Guerrilla and paramilitary
 groups, in particular, but also government security forces violated international hu-
 manitarian law in Colombia's internal conflict. The ICRC reported that the Govern-
 ment, including military authorities, followed an open dor policy toward the ICRC
 and incorporated Red Cross curriculums on international humanitarian law in
 standard military training. A persistent, if unofficial, emphasis by the army on body
 count as a means of assessing field performance is a main contributing cause of vi-
 
 
 lations of international humanitarian law. With rare exceptions, according to mili-
 tary sources, local commanders typically preferred to discharge soldiers accused of
 raping civilian women and other serious human rights violations, rather than to ini-
 tiate court martial proceedings.
 A consortium of NGO's in eastern Antioquia reported an operation conducted on
 January 29 by 40 soldiers of a battalion stationed at Rionegro together with a num-
 ber of civilians, who surrounded the San Vicente home of the Diaz Alzate. The
 attackers fired indiscriminately and threw two grenades at the house in which two
 elderly members of the family, two adults, and one child were present. The head
 of the household was wounded and taken to the military base where he was held
 for 24 hours before the family was informed of his whereabouts. Also in January,
 witnesses reported receiving threats from paramilitary  mup in the city of Ocana
 that they should attend a meeting of business people, allegedly guarded by soldiers,
 at which members of paramilitary groups subjected the attendees to death threats
 and extortion if they did not cooperate with the military forces in the *Dn.
 In Sucre, during the first 113 days of the year, paramilitary or self-deiense groups
 killed 137 persons. This escalation of violence effectively forced 800 families to aban-
 don their land. The victims were typically campesinos, teachers, civic leaders, and
 other noncombatants suspected of sympathizing with guerrillas. The violence contin-
 ued throughout the year, with a marked upsurge beginning in late November. The
 paramilitary massacre of 17 peasants during a 1-day campaign was just one of a
 number of paramilitary attack in Sucre The CINEP repo    d that Putumayo de-
 partment had surpassed Uraba with Colombia's highest violent death rate, 425 per
 100,000 persons, mn 1995. Firearms were used in 95 percent of these killings. That
 violence escalated in the first months of 1996, according to the CINEP and the
 Putumayo Departmental Committee for Human Rights. Both attributed the violence
 to drug trafickers, guerrillas, and paramilitary groups. A paramilitary group mas-
 sacred 15 people in Segovia, Antioquia, in April. in May the prosecutor arrested an
 army captain and a paramilitary organization member in connection with the mas-
 sacre. Parts of Antioquia also saw an escalation of paramilitary violence during No-
 vember and December. The year ended with a massacre on December 31 by
 paramilitaries of as many as 11 civilians, including 2 indigenous leaders of the
 Nendo community in Dabeiba, Antioquia.
 On February 15, Protocol II of the Geneva Convention entered into force. The
 Constitutional Court had earlier ruled that the law ratifying the protocol would be
 equally applicable to government and guerrilla forces. Despite some pronouncements
 of support, guerrilla organizations continued to pursue a strategy that included kid-
 naping, targeting of civilian populations and installations, deployment of land
 mines, and recruitment of minors.
 The loosely organized guerrilla grups of the Simon Bolivar Coordinating Body,
 which include primarily the FARC and ELN, commanded an estimated 10,000 to
 15,000 full-time guerrillas organized in over 100 "fronts." These groups exercised a
 degree of permanent influence in over half of Colombia's local municipalities. They
 ommitted a host of violations, including kilings, kidnapings, deployment of anti-
 personnel land mines, oil pipeline bombings, and other acts of sabotage.
 According to estimates by CINEP and Justice and Peace, guerrillas were respon-
 sible for killing at least 189 civilians between January and September. In the con-
 tinuing        for ontrol of the narcotics and arms trafficking corridor of Uraba,
  ia retlation for paramiitary attacks regularly victimized innocent civilians,
 although some direct clashes with paramilitary units did occur. To justify summary
 executions of civilians, guerrillas typically charged that their victims were either in-
 formants for the army or related in some other way to the State, or that they simply
 refused to support the guerrillas' operations.
 The FARC continued its campaign of assassination against the Hope, Peace and
 Freedom Movement, whose members had left the EPL in the early 1990's and had
 since become active in the National Syndicate of Agro-Industry Workers in Uraba.
 FARC guerrillas killed 2 children near Miraflores, Guaviare, when they detonated
 1 of 50 and mines that their forces had deployed in the area. The FARC's Septem-
 ber attack on unarmed policemen playing sports in the town of Uramita, Antioquia,
 was typical. In addition to one policeman and one adult civilian, the FARC killed
 a 3-year-old child during the attack. In another incident the FARO killed four police-
 men transporting prisoners in Antioquia. They then released the prisoners, includ-
 ing three murderers and one narcotics trafficker. In August and September, FARC
 forces killed over 10 people, at one point paralyzing traffic in half the country's de-
 partments by threatening to burn vehicles on the highway.
 The National Liberation Army (ELN) also targeted civilians. In one incident in
 May, ELN guerrillas intercepted a bus and shot four of its passengers. There are
 confirmed reports of continued instances of ELN and FARC death threats against
 
 
 398
 the girlfriends, fiancees, and wives of policemen and soldiers. According to press re-
 ports, in November an ELN front active in southern Antioquia summarily executed
 1 of its own members.
 In May a FARC guerrilla attack killed at least 16 persons, including 2 children,
 in the fishing town of Turbo, Uraba. The guerrillas burned numerous houses; 20
 persons were victims of forced disappearance. In September members of the fifth
 FARC front summarily executed four rural community leaders near Apartado
 Uraba. In February the ELN attacked and nearly killed the 17-year-old girlfriend
 of a policeman.
 On March 13, FARC guerrillas attacked a police station in Chalan, Sucre killing
 11 police members. The police accused townspeople of advance knowledge o? the at-
 tack, and eventually withdrew from the town center. Paramilitaries moved in short-
 ly thereafter. On April 15, a guerrilla ambush killed 31 soldiers on patrol, and Jose
 Maya Garcia, chair of the Chamber of Representatives' peace commission, was kid-
 naped. These assaults prompted President Samper to create special public order
 zones by decree 2 days later.
 On August 30, FARC and EL2 guerrillas coordinated forces to launch a major of-
 fensive, with 28 attacks in 11 departments during a 48-hour period. The most nota-
 ble attack was the FARC assault on an army outpost in Las Delicias, Putumayo de-
 partment. The guerrillas killed 29 soldiers and took another 60 hostage. At year's
 end, the soldiers remained in FARC custody, with negotiations for their release at
 an impasse. Guerrilla violence continued at an escalated level throughout Septem-
 ber and October, with roadblocks and sporadic killings throughout the country.
 Initial reports implicated guerrillas in the social cleansing homicide of two other
 individuals in Valle del Cauca department in February. Guerrilla organizations con-
 tinued to recruit minors between the ages of 12 and 15; some press accounts re-
 ported cases of children under the age of 12 among guerrilla ranks. Once recruited,
 the child guerrillas are virtual prisoners of their commanders and subject to various
 forms of widespread abuse. Sexual abuse of young girls is a particular problem.
 In general, the guerrilla leadership continued to exploit the issue of human rights
 violations for propaganda purposes but took no measurable steps to abide by inter-
 national standards. In March the Dutch NGO Pax Christi sharply criticized the
 FARC leadership for their human rights practices. The FARC demonstrated this
 lack of good faith by drawing out negotiations for the release of the soldiers cap-
 tured during the attack on Las Delicias and reneging on their promise to release
 the soldiers to the ICRC. The president of the Catholic Conference of Bishops criti-
 cized the FARC leadership for prolonging the captive soldiers' ordeal and made a
 direct televised appeal for their immediate release, to no avail.
 A CINEP report on violence in Putumayo department also cited guerrilla viola-
 tions of international humanitarian law. Other accounts of guerrilla abuse included
 reports that the bodies of 20 soldiers killed at La Carpa in Guaviare department
 in September showed signs of mutilation by dogs. The FARC force had overwhelmed
 a small army unit called in to aid a small community that had been harassed and
 intimidated by the guerrillas.
 In 1994 the Government initiated a program to organize and register legal civilian
 rural defense cooperatives, known collectively as Convivir, which were to provide
 counterinsurgency intelligence to local military commanders. These groups num-
 bered approximately 200 by June, primarily in central and northern Colombia, ac-
 cording to the CINEP. Although the authorities originally intended these groups to
 be unarmed, by mid-1996 they had authorized a number of them to carry arms. By
 year's end, government officials had received the first citizen complaints that some
 of these groups had exceeded their authority and were acting as vigilantes.
 Although the governor of Antioquia expressed the belief that the Convivir groups
 could be controlled, some mayors and other local officials in Antioquia disagreed.
 The Ombudsman's 1996 report to Congress reiterated his office's opposition to the
 Convivir program. Citing the Government's inability to control such groups in past
 administrations, the Ombudsman expressed concern that the Convivir cooperatives,
 too, would lack accountability. Other government human rights monitors expressed
 similar concerns.
 Drug traffickers, guerrillas, and common criminals continued to target soldiers
 and police on a daily basis. A FARC ambush that killed 31 soldiers in April was
 typical of the guerrilla strategy of attacking small and vulnerable units. Guerrillas
 intensified this strategy during the September offensive which began with the at-
 tack on Las Delicias.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The authorities generally respected these con-
 stitutionally protected rights, but were quick to apply subtle (and not so subtle)
 
 
 399
 pressure on the media when their core interests were threatened. Most media re-
 sisted such pressure, but the less powerful media organizations submitted to it.
 Other signs of government efforts to influence the meaia included occasional calls
 on patriotic grounds to limit negative reporting that might hurt the country's image
 in the world. On January 30, a member of the National Television Commission or-
 dered the state-controlled television network to cut off the live broadcast of congres-
 sional debate that followed the President's address to a special session of Congress.
 The Government thus cut off a Senator in the midst of her denunciation of the
 President, based on her first-hand knowledge, for having solicited contributions from
 drug traffickers for his presidential campaign.
 The National Television Commission threatened to review the license of the tele-
 vision newscast '24 HOURS" unless the news director appeared before the commis-
 sion and justified an interview with a foreign ambassador that was critical of the
 President. The threat was an obvious effort by Samper administration allies on the
 commission to intimidate newscasts into softening their stances toward the Govern-
 ment.
 In December the National Television Commission singled out "TV HOY," a na-
 tional television news network, by threatening to impose a fine and a 2-day broad-
 cast suspension for an inaccurate report. The network retracted the broadcast re-
 port, but at year's end, the issue of the fine and the suspension remained unre-
 solved. Critics charged that the Commission was selectively applying standards of
 accuracy, its primary criterion apparently being whether a report reflected positively
 on President Samper's image.
 Congressional allies of the Samper administration introduced legislation that
 would suspend the licenses of 12 television newscasts, valid under existing law until
 December 31, 2003. Ignoring concerns expressed by the Inter-American Press Asso-
 ciation (IAPA), Congress passed and in late December, President Samper signed
 into law fundamental changes in treatment of television newscasts that are ex-
 pected to have a chilling effect on freedom of the press. The new law revoked pre-
 vious hands-off licensing procedures and made license holders of television news-
 casts on the three government channels subject to review-and possible revocation
 and mandatory exclusion from television newscasting for 5 years--every 6 months.
 This law also opens the door to the creation of two new private television channels
 that will fall under the ownership of economic conglomerates that have historically
 enjoyed a privileged relationship with whatever government is in power. While court
 challenges are expected, the new law is an obvious effort by the Samper administra-
 tion to eliminate troubling television news coverage of a scandal-ridden administra-
 tion and to reward its powerful backers for remaining loyal. Television news pre-
 viously relatively free, albeit prone to sensationalism and low journalistic standards,
 is now subject as never before to intrusive government censorship.
 The privately owned print media published a wide spectrum of political view-
 points and often voiced harsh antigovernment opinions without administrative re-
 prisals. The Government imposed some restrictions on electronic media coverage of
 incidents of public disorder and of drug terrorist activity and reserved the right to
 prohibit coverage of certain news events that could affect state security. During the
 protest of coca growers and harvesters in Caqueta department in August, army sol-
 diers injured two television cameramen. The soldiers severely beat one cameramen
 because he had filmed them beating an unarmed civilian.
 Under a state of emergency the Government may regulate the media only to the
 extent of controlling information that ma endanger lives or directly induce public
 disturbances. The Government may use television and radio stations as it deems ap-
 propriate but may not prohibit reports of human rights violations. The Government
 may not establish an official censorship board, but accredited media associations are
 to act as a self-regulatory tribunal.
 All citizens have the right to seek a judicial injunction or motion (tutela) in cases
 involving violations of basic constitutional rights. This provides all persons and or-
 ganizations, including the media, with a mechanism to denounce both private and
 government violations of basic constitutional rights.
 In  October   unknown    assailants  murdered  journalist  Norvey   Diaz  in
 Cundinamarca department. For over 5 years, Diaz had investigated and reported
 the existence of social cleansing groups, which he claimed had links to the police
 in the city of Girardot. He had received death threats throughout the year. The Om-
 budsman reported in 1995 that 107 journalists had been murdered since 1980--
 often victims of paramilitary organizations, guerrilla groups, and narcotics traffick-
 ers.
 Both Colombian and international journalists typically work in an atmosphere of
 threat. In January Mexican journalist Jorge Ramos of the Univision News Network
 curtailed his stay because of death threats he received after an interview with
 
 
 400
 former Defense Minister Fernando Botero. During that interview, Botero accused
 President Samper of being behind the strategy to solicit campaign donations from
 drug traffickers. In February DAS agents detained a journalist who was collaborat-
 ing with Botero on a forthcoming book. They questioned her at the Bogota airport
 and reportedly photocopied her notes before permitting her departure. Another
 Univision journalist, Colombian Raul Benoit, was the target of a murder attempt
 in March in connection with his work.
 The Government generally respected academic freedom, and there exists a wide
 spectrum of political activity throughout the country's universities. Paramilitary
 groups and guerrillas, however, often targeted teachers at the elementary and sec-
 ondary levels in areas of conflict. They also threatened university-level academics
 doing studies on internal conflict and human rights.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and the Government respects these
 rights in practice. The authorities do not normally interfere with public meetins
 and demonstrations and usually grant the required permission except when they de-
 termine that there is imminent danger to public order. In Bogota, however, officials
 who routinely issue demonstration permits indicated they were under pressure to
 discriminate against some of the civic action groups that organized to criticize the
 President. Any organization is free to associate with international groups in its field.
 NGO's criticized the Government's response to protest demonstrations involving
 an estimated 80,000 to 150,000 "cocaleros" (coca cultivators and field workers, sup-
 ported in part by guerrillas and narcotics traffickers) who mobilized in July, August,
 and early September to impede the Government's counternarcotics operations in
 coca-growing regions. In the resulting confrontations, government forces generally
 abided by standing orders not to employ deadly force. However, soldiers did kill
 some protesters and some abuses were alleged. Investigators sent to the region by
 a consortium of'NGO's attributed 13 killings to the army, 1 to the police, and 4 to
 guerrillas. They cautioned, however, that the death toll may have been higher. An
 estimated 200 demonstrators were injured; soldiers and police also sustained inju-
 ries. The NGO delegation reported other types of abuse, including incidents of exces-
 sive use of force, forced disappearances, arbitrary arrests, destruction of private
 roperty, and eradication of legitimate crops. The NGO's also reported that the mur-
 der of two soldiers may have been related to the protest.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for complete religious freedom,
 and the Government respects this right in practice. There is little religious discrimi-
 nation. Roman Catholic religious instruction is no longer mandatory in state schools,
 and a Constitutional Court decision in 1994 found unconstitutional any official gov-
 ernment reference to religious characterizations of the country. The Government
 permits proselytizing among the indigenous population, provided that it is welcome
 and does not induce members of indigenous communities to adopt changes that en-,
 danger their survival on traditional lands. The law on the freedom of cults provides
 a mechanism for religions to obtain the status of recognized legal entities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides citizens with the right to travel domestically
 and abroad. Outsiders wishing to enter Indian tribes' reserves must be invited. In
 areas where military operations against guerrillas are underway, police or military
 officials occasionally required civilians to obtain safe-conduct passes; guerrillas re-
 ported y used similar means to restrict travel in areas under their control. Guerrilla
 incursions, military counterinsurgency operations, guerrilla and paramilitary con-
 scription, and land seizures by narcotics traffickers often forced peasants to flee
 their homes and farms. In October the office of the President's adviser for human
 rights reported that 750,000 out of a total population of 35 million are displaced per-
 sons. This marks a significant increase since 1995, when the Colombian Conference
 of Bishops reported 600,000 displaced persons. The President's adviser attributed
 the mass displacement to the presence of paramilitary, guerrilla, and narcotics traf-
 ticking organizations in many regions and the armed confrontations among them,
 as well as with the armed forces. The report cited factors such as threats, murder
 attempts, selective killings, massacres, torture, and aerial combat operations pro-
 voked by participants in the armed confict. The adviser's office further estimated
 that 195 persns per day must leave their homes because of the violence.
 According to the System of Information on Households Displaced by Violence
 (SISDES), the army was responsible for 16 percent of the iplacement par-
 military organizations for 32 percent, and guerrilla organizations for 26 percent.
 h       attributed the remaining 26 percent to the influence of the police, urban
 militias, and drug traffickers. The Uraba region of Antioquia and Choo depart-
 ments suffered the greatest displacement. The Ombudsman reported that 300,000
 persons fled Uraba or other regions during the last 10 years.
 
 
 A case that aroused considerable controversy was that of 106 families violently
 displaced by members of paramilitary groups from land in Cesar department that
 the Colombian ambassador to the European Union claims to be his property. Many
 of these families sought shelter with the Ombudsman in Bogota, where they re-
 mained at year's end for lack of other refuge. On November 5 the ambassador re-
 signed, following an October 24 resolution by the European Parliament criticizing
 the Government for gross human rights violations and calling for the ambassador
 to step down. Displaced persons continued to face a crucial dilemma: They could not
 stay in conflict zones because of legitimate fears for their safety, but they also were
 rejected and perceived as an economic burden by the regions and cities that were
 their most common destinations.
 Colombia has had a tradition of providing political asylum since the 1920's. Dur-
 ing the 1970's, Colombia granted asylum to Argentine, Chilean, Uruguayan, and
 Paraguayan citizens seeking refuge from dictatorial regimes in their own countries.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the Unted Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The
 Government reserves the right to determine eligibility for asylum, based upon its
 own assessment of the political nature of the persecution an applicant may have suf-
 fered. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise. There were no reports
 of the forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercise this right in regular, secret ballot elections that have historically
 been considered fair and open. However, critics question if they are indeed fair,
 pointing out that vote buying is a regular feature of elections in some regions, and
 that President Samper's 1994 election campaign solicted and received contributions
 from drug traffickers. Presidential elections are held every 4 years. The Liberal and
 Conservative parties have long monopolized the formal political process with one or
 the other customarily winning the presidency. The President serves only one term
 and may not be reelected. All citizens are enfranchised at the age of 18. Public em-
 ployees are not permitted to participate in campaigns but, with the exception of the
 military, may vote. Officially, all political parties operate freely without government
 interference. Those that fail to garner 50,000 votes in a general election may lose
 the right to present candidates and may not receive funds from the Government.
 However, they may reincorporate at any time by presenting 50,000 signatures to the
 National Electoral Board.
 The 1991 Constitution created the office of vice president, replacing an arguably
 less significant "presidential designate," elected by Congress. In 1994 the country
 held a national presidential election as well as congressional, gubernatorial, and
 mayoral elections. For the first time, the country also elected a Vice President,
 Humberto de la Calle, who ran on the Liberal Party ticket with presidential can-
 didate Ernesto Samper. (Carlos Lemos Simmonds replaced De la Calle, who re-
 signed in September.) Liberal Party representatives made a strong showing in the
 congressional elections, providing a Liberal majority in both houses. However, bipar-
 tisan coalitions were still often necessary for the Liberals to enact legislation. A
 group of Conservative Party supporters was key in the 111-to-44 vote not to im-
 peach Samper on charges of knowingly receiving campaign contributions from drug
 traffickers.
 The high level of violence has a profound effect on the political process: Reiniciar's
 report to the IACHR listed freely elected officials forced to leave Colombia because
 of death threats. In addition to the murdered UP officials (see Section L.a.), the of-
 fice of the High Commissioner for Peace reported that 1,143 civic and political lead-
 ers of other parties were killed between 1990 and 1995.
 There are no legal restrictions, and few practical ones, on the participation of
 women or minorities in the political process. Seven female senators and 19 female
 representatives served among the 267 members of Congress, including the first vice
 president of the House of Representatives. The Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Agri-
 culture, Education, and Health were women, as were the President's advisers for ju-
 ridical affairs, for Bogota, for Medellin, and for public administration affairs.
 The Constitution reserves 2 seats in the 102-seat Senate for representatives of the
 indigenous population, and a 1993 law set aside 2 seats in the 165-seat House of
 Representatives for citizens of African heritage. In September, however, the Con-
 stitutional Court declared the latter law unconstitutional. The Court tasked the two
 African-Colombian representatives to redraft the law during the remaining 2 years
 of their terms in order to establish the permanent seats in a manner consistent with
 provisions of the 1991 Constitution.

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A large nongovernmental human rights community is active. It includes the Cen-
 ter for Investigations and Popular Research, the Colombian Commission of Jurists,
 the Intercongregational Commission for Justice and Peace, the Permanent Commit-
 tee for the  eene Catholic Bishops Conference, the Latin
 American Institute for Alternative Legal Services, the Association of Families of De-
 tained and Disappeared Persons, and Peace Brigades International.
 NGO's investigated and reported on human rights abuses committed by govern-
 ment forces, the paramilitries, and guerrillas. They expressed serious concern at
 what they viewed to be the increasing militarization of Colombia as the internal
 armed conflict escalated, and with it, a loss of interest in seeking peace through ne-
 gotiation. NGO's almost unanimously criticized the deterioration of the Sampr ad-
 ministration's human rights policies, particularly his reliance on declared states of
 emergency and establishment of special order zones--which they characterized as
 allowing the military to displace civil authority, and imposing abusive restrictions
 on citizens. NGO's were highly critical of the Governments handling of the protest
 of the cocaleros, whom they believed unfairly bore the brunt of the Government's
 antidrg policy.
 The Gvenent in November took a significant steop to expand human rights
 monitoring by signing an agement with the United Nations High Commissioner
 on Human Rights to establish a field office in Bogota. This seven-person offie,
 s cheduled to open in February 1997, is to monitor, analyze, and report on human
 rights abuses throughout the count. It is expected to serve as an experiment and
 model for other countries under U   e. sctiny for their high incidence of human
 rights violations.
 The Government has an extensive human rights apparatus, which includes the
 office of the President's Adviser for Human Rights, the mbudsman and its regional
 representatives, the Attorney General's office for human rights and regional rep-
 resentatives, and a special unit within the Prosecutor General's office. The Ministry
 of Defense has had a Secretariat for Human Rights since 1994, with a system of
 208 human rights offices, down to the battalion level, distributed through all
 branches of the armed services, including the police. By year's end, the Interior Min-
 istry had selected a candidate to head its new human rights office, which is to ex-
 pand existing programs within the Ministry. The Red Cross and presidential adviser
 collaborated with the armed services to expand training in human rights and inter-
 national humanitarian law.
 In general, a state of estrangement continued between the Samper administration
 and the NGO's, which found no reason to return to the Joint Commission on Human
 Rights which they left in 1995. Prominent military officials voiced feelings of frus-
 tration and outright hostility toward the NGO community. After much debat, a ma-
 jority of NGO's agreed that the establishment of a field office of the U.N. Commis-
 sioner for Human Rights was a workable alternative to a Special Rapprtur. This
 agreement implied recognition for the efforts of the Government's civilian human
 rights officials who proposed the office despite fierce opposition from high-ranking
 molitary officials. Nevertheless, the corps of government human rights advisers and
 monitors was often unsuccessful in getting its recommendations adopted on govern-
 ment poeimcy issues.
 offhiugthe Goven   ent generally did not interfere with the work of human
 reritsaGsstaff members and volunteers often faced threats and intimidation by
 individual members of the police and armed forces, paramilitary groups, or guerril-
 las. Since October human rights lawyer Pedro JulionMacheca Ava has been under
 surveillance by unidentified individuals who also attempted to locate members of his
 family. The motivation for this pattern of harassment may be Macheca Avila's legal
 representation of controversial figures, among whom are acknowledged members of
 the ELN guerrilla group. Macheca Avila's representation of peasant families threat-
 ened by paramilitaries in Cesar department may also be the cause of the harass-
 ment.
 Peace Brigades International expressed concern that an investigation of the orga-
 nization in June by the SIJIN (local police investigators), ossibaw working with te
 army, may have been part of an effort to intimidate and dscredit the organization.
 Many prominent human rights monitors worked under constant fear for their phys-
 ical safety. The executive dnirector of the Permanent Committee for the Protection
 of Human Rights left the countr in May after narrowly escaping an attempt on his
 life by armed assailants.
 The outgoing Ombudsman expressed serious concern over the Samper administra-
 tion's dclmning commitment to human rights program initiated during the Presi-
 dent's first year in office. This decline began in mid-1995 with the onset of the plit-
 
 
 ical crisis related to formal testimony indicating that President Samper knew of and
 welcomed donations from drug traffickers to his 1994 presidential campaign. Many
 government and NGO human rights monitors expressed concern that Samper's fail-
 ure to promote reform of the military justice system, coupled with hard-line Sen-
 ators' "counterreform" proposals, indicated a growing willingness by both the execu-
 tive and legislative branches to cede to the military some of the already limited
 checks that the Attorney General and Prosecutor General exercise under the 1991
 Constitution. Such counterreforms are scheduled for congressional debate in 1997.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution specifically prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion,
 disability, language, or social status. In practice, however, many of these provisions
 are not enforced.
 NGO's report that homosexuals are occasional victims of violence and the vigi-
 lante killings known as social cleansing.
 Women.-Rape and other acts of violence against women are pervasive in society,
 and like other crimes, are seldom prosecuted successfully. Spousal abuse in itself
 is not considered a crime. The quasi-governmental Institute for Family Welfare
 (ICBF) and the Presidential adviser's Office for Youth, Women, and Family Affairs
 continued to report high levels of spouse and partner abuse throughout the country.
 The ICBF conducted programs and provided refuge and counseling for victims of
 spouse abuse, but the level and amount of these services were dwarfed by the mag-
 nitude of the problem.
 The law provides relatively mild sentences, ranging from 6 months to 8 years, for
 crimes of sexual abuse and allows for significant sentence reductions based on the
 conduct of the convicted perpetrator. In cases of sexual abuse, police may not legally
 detain the perpetrators unless the abuse was committed in conjunction with other
 crimes. In most cases, the assailant is released because the law permits the proba-
 tionary release of criminals convicted of crimes carrying minimum sentences of less
 than 2 years. In July President Samper signed Law 294 on family violence, which
 identifies as crimes violent acts committed within families, including spousal rape.
 It also provides legal recourse for victims of family violence, immediate rotection
 from physical or psychological abuse, and judicial authority to remove the abuser
 from the household. The law also allows a judge to oblige an abuser to seek therapy
 or reeducation. For acts of spousal sexual violence, the law mandates sentences of
 6 months to 2 years. It denies probation or bail to offenders who disobey court re-
 straining orders. At year's end, it was too soon to measure the effect the new law
 may have.
 The Constitution prohibits any form of discrimination against women and specifi-
 cally requires the authorities to "guarantee adequate and effective participation by
 women at decisionmaking levels of public administration." Even prior to implemen-
 tation of the 1991 Constitution, the law had provided women with extensive civil
 rights. Despite these constitutional provisions, however, discrimination against
 women persists. According to figures published by the United Nations, women's
 earnings for formal sector, nonagricultural work correspond to approximately 85
 percent of men's earnings for comparable work, and women must demonstrate high-
 er qualifications than men when appling for jobs. Moreover, women constitute a
 disproportionately high percentage of the subsistence labor work force, especially in
 rural areas. Women's groups such as Promujer and the Association of Twenty-First
 Century Women reported that the social and economic problems of single mothers
 remained great throughout the year, despite government efforts to provide them
 with training in parenting skills.
 Children.-The Government provide public education, which is compulsory for
 children 6 through 14 years of age. Nevertheless, an estimated 25 percent of chil-
 dren in this age group do not attend school, due to lax enforcement of truancy laws
 and inadequate classroom space.
 Despite significant constitutional and legislative commitments to the protection of
 the rights of children, these were only minimally implemented. The Constitution im-
 poses the obligation on family, society, and the State to assist and protect children,
 to foster their development, and to assure the full exercise of these rights. A special
 Children's Code sets forth many of these rights and establishes services and pro-
 grams designed to enforce the protection of minors. Children's advocates reported
 the need to educate citizens with regard to the code as well as the new Law on Fam-
 ily Violence, which was drafted particularly to increase legal protection for women
 and children. The ICBF oversees all government child protection and welfare pro-
 grams and funds nongovernmental and church programs for children.

 Child prostitution was commonplace in the five major cities. In Medellin the city
 initiated in August a program called "Street Dwellers" as an outreach program to
 assist child prostitutes ranging in age from 8 to 18 years. Street children continued
 to be the targets of social cleansing gangs. In conflict zones, children were also often
 caught in the crossfire between the security forces paramilitarq groups, and guer-
 rilla. organizations. Deadly land mines known as "leg breakers laid Ty guerrillas
 killed or mutilated many children in these areas. Guerrilla groups continued to re-
 cruit minors, and there were increased reports that they sexually abused teenage
 female recruits. According to figures published by the army, approximately 2,000
 children participated in some fashion in the guerrilla combat. An estimated 48 per-
 cent of all persons displaced by violence are children. According to statistics com-
 piled by the President's antikidnaping czar and the Pals Libre foundation, children
 surpassed businessmen and ranchers as prime kidnaping targets during the first
 months of the year.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution enumerates the fundamental social,
 economic, and cultural rights of the physically disabled, but serious practical im-
 pediments exist to prevent disabled persons' full participation in society. There is
 no legilation that specifically mandates access for peopole with disabilities. Accord-
 ng to the Constitutional Court, physically disabled idividuals must have access to
 receive assistance at voting stations. Also according to a Constitutional Court rul-
 ing, the social security fund for public employees cannot refuse to provide services
 for the disabled children of its members, regardless of the cost involved.
 Indigenous People.-There are approimatey 82 distinct ethnic groups among the
 800,000 indigenous inhabitants. The Constitution gives special recognition to the
 fundamental rights of indigenous people. It provides for a special criminal and civil
 jurisdiction, based upon traditional community laws, within Indian territories. The
 Ministry of Interior, through the Office of Indigenous Affairs, is responsible for pro-
 tecting the territorial, cultural, and self-determination rights of Indians. Ministry
 representatives are located in all regions of the country with indigenous populations
 and work with other governmental human and civil rights organizations to promote
 Indian interests and investigate violations of indigenous rights. Nonetheless, mem-
 bers of indigenous groups suffer discrimination in the sense that they have tradi-
 tionally been relegated to the margins of society. Few opportunities exist for those
 who might wish to participate more fully in modern life.
 Traditional Indian authority beards operate some 334 designated Indian reserves;
 the beards handle national or local funds and are subject to fiscal oversight by the
 national Comptroller General. These boards administer their territories as munici-
 pal entities, with officials eleted or otherwise chosen according to Indian tradition.
 Indige   sommunities are free to educate their children in traditional dialects and
 in the observance of cultural and religious customs. Indigenous men are not subject
 to the national military draft.
 In June members of the Wayuu community occupied the headquarters of the Gov-
 ernment's Office of Indigenous Affairs to protest what the wayuu considered the
 Government's condescending treatment of the community. The protesters subse-
 quently moved their protest to the offices of the Colombian Conference of Bishops.
 The protest ended after 36 days, when the Government issued two decrees creating
 a human rights commission for indigenous communities and a permanent board for
 coordination with the indigenous communities.
 Indigenous communities suffer disproportionately from the internal armed con-
 flict. In September 4,000 members of indigenous communities gathered in Popayan,
 the capital of Cauca department to protest the presence of government forces
 par    'taies, and guerrilla in their territories and to meet with government au-
 thorities to initiate a dialog on better health and education services, environmental
 protection, and agricultural development.
 A contract that Ecopetrol, the national oil company, awarded to Occidental Petro-
 leum caused a direct conflict with the W'wa indigenous community. Despite a provi-
 sion of the 1991 Constitution obliging the Government to consult indigenous popu-
 lations before allowing any development or change on indigenous territory, the con-
 tract called for Occidental Petroleum to conduct a geological survey for petroleum
 sources. In response to a formal request by the Ombudsman, a Bogota tribunal is-
 sued an injunction ordering the Government to respect the w'wa community's rights
 in this matter. The Supreme Court subsequently granted an appeal filed by
 Ecopetrol and Occidental. That decision in turn threw the case to the Constitutional
 Court for a final ruling which was still pending at year's end.
 Despite official government policy to protect indigenous populations, members of
 indigenous communities were frequently the victims of violence throughout the year.
 By August 12 members of the Senu community of the San Andres de Sotavento in-
 digenous reserve, including the community's mayor, had been killed. In zones where
 
 
 the guerrillas were active, such as the Sierra Nevada and Valle de Cauca, the secu-
 rity forces often suspected the indigenous population of complicity with narcotics
 traffickers and guerrillas. However, most of the incidents in which people attacked
 or threatened Indians stemmed from land ownership disputes concerning the des-
 ignated Indian reserves. The National Land Reform Institute estimated that some
 40 indigenous communities had lost legal title to land that they claimed as their
 own and that roughly 100 other groups had title claims that were not recognized
 or reconciled.
 National lRaciallEthnic Minorities.-Approximately 2 million citizens of African
 heritage live primarily in the Pacific departments of Choco, Valle del Cauca, and
 Narino, and along the Caribbean coast. They represent roughly 4 percent of the
 total population, although representatives of the African-Colombian community be-
 lieve their population is much larger. Blacks are entitled to all constitutional rights
 and protections but have traditionally suffered from economic discrimination.
 Despite the passae of the African-Colombian Law in 1993, little concrete progress
 was made in expanding public services and private investment in the Choco or other
 predominantly black regions. In September the Government established a special
 fund to provide scholarships and credits to expand African-Colombians' access to
 higher education. Allegations of discrimination and hazing by the military against
 Afrcan-Colombians ontinued. The navy makes little effort to recruit African-Co-
 lombians, despite their traditional ties to the sea and maritime commerce. Like
 other communities on the margins of society, Afr-Colombians suffered dispropor-
 tionately from political violence, particularly in the struggle between paramilitary
 and guerrilla forces for control of Uraba. Unemployment among African-Colombians
 is as high as 76 percent in some communities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law recognizes the rights of workers to organize
 unions and strike. The Labor Code provides for automatic recognition of unions that
 obtain at least 25 signatures from the potential members and comply with a simple
 registration process at the Labor Ministry. The law penalizes interference with free-
 dom of association. It allows unions to determine freely internal rules, elect officials,
 and manage activities, and forbids the dissolution of trade unions by administrative
 fiat. According to Labor Ministry estimates, approximately 7 percent of the work
 force is organized in 2,235 unions.
 The 1991 Constitution provides for the right to strike by nonessential public em-
 ployees and authorizes Congress to pass enabling legislation that would define 'es-
 sential," but legislation that prohibits public employees from striking is still in force.
 Before staging a legal strike, unions must negotiate directly with management
 and-if no agreement results-accept mediation. By law, public employees must ac-
 cept binding arbitration if mediation fails; in practice, public service unions decide
 by membership vote whether or not to seek arbitration.
 In 1993 the International Labor Organization (ILO) criticized 10 provisions of the
 law, including- The supervision of the internal management and meetings of unions
 by government officials; the presence of officials at assemblies convened to vote on
 a strike call; the legality of firing union oranizers from jobs in their trades once
 6 months have passed following a strike or dspute; the requirement that contenders
 for trade union office must belong to the occupation their union represents; the pro-
 hibition of strikes in a wide range of public services that are not necessarily essen-
 tial; various restrictions on the right to strike; the power of the Minister of Labor
 and the President to intervene in disputes through compulsory arbitration when a
 strike is declared illegal; and the power to dismiss trade union officers involved in
 an unlawful strike.
 On October 14 truck drivers staged a major strike that paralyzed cargo transport
 in many regions of the country. The Minister of Transportation declared the strike
 illegal and ordered the truckers back to work. When they refused, the Government
 declared that it would consider taking legal action against 105 trucking companies,
 arrested 60 drivers, and investigated 216 cargo vehicle owners. The strike ended
 after 11 days, when government and trucking representatives reached an accord
 raising the allowable cost of cargo transport.
 A collective work convention signed in 1995 between Ecopetrol and the Union of
 Syndicated Labor (USO) remained in effect. That accord was the result of the Gov-
 ernment's restructuring, rather than privatizing, Ecopetrol to avoid massive layoffs.
 The USO leadership remained in open conflict with the Government on many is-
 sues. USO leaders reported further that its members continued to receive death
 threats from presumed paramilitary groups active in the oil-producing Magdalena
 Medio region.
 
 
 406
 Labor leaders throughout the country continued to be the target of attacks by the
 military, police, paramilitary groups, guerrillas, narcotics traffickers, and their own
 union rivals. In Apr the Latin American Central of Workers reported that at least
 2,000 Colombian union members and leaders had been killed since 1991. According
 to figures published by Justice and Peace, during the first 6 months of 1996, 14
 labor activists were murdered in connection with their labor activities. The report
 listed 2 presumed murdered because of their labor activities, 2 forcible disappear-
 ances, and 12 illegal detentions. In the banana-producing region of Uraba, organized
 workers historically belonged to the extreme left wing of te labor movement but
 refused, to cooperate with the FARC. Paramilitary and guerrilla organizations car-
 ried out a rash of massacres in Uraba throughout the year. Approximately half the
 victims of the FARC massacres were former EPL members, targeted for their par-
 ticipation in or sympathy with the National Syndicate of Agro-Industry Workers, a
 labor union closely associated with the Hope, Peace, and Freedom Movement of de-
 mobilized EPL guerrillas.
 The list of killings, intimidations, and arbitrary arrests of labor union leaders in-
 cluded the murder of Norte de Santander Workers Union president Elba Hernandez
 de Aguilera in August and the forced disappearance and murder of Unified Workers'
 Central member Hector Posada, found in a mass grave in March in Uraba. The Jus-
 tice and Peace data bank reported 61 threats against other labor leaders were re-
 ported from January through June.
 Unions are free to join international confederations without government restric-
 tions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution protects the
 right of workers to organize and engage in collective bargaining. Workers in larger
 firms and public services have been most successful in organizing, but these union-
 ized workers represent only a small portion of the economically active population.
 High unemployment (about 12 percent), traditional antiunion attitudes, and weak
 union organization and leadership limit workers' bargaining power in all sectors.
 The law forbids antiunion discrimination and the obstruction of free association.
 Government labor inspectors theoretically enforce these provisions, but because of
 the small number of inspectors and workers' fears of losing their jobs, the inspection
 apparatus is weak. The Labor Code calls for fines to be levied for restricting free-
 dom of association and prohibits the use of strike breakers.
 Collective pacts-agreements between individual workers and their employers-
 are not subject to collective bargaining and are typically used by employers to ob-
 struct labor organization. Although employers must registered collective pacts with
 the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry does not exercise any oversight or control over
 them.
 The Labor Code also eliminates mandatory mediation in private labor-manage-
 ment disputes and extends the grace period before the Government can intervene
 in a conflict. Federations and confederations may assist affiliate unions in collective
 bargaining.
 Labor law applies to the country's seven free trade zones (FTZ's), but its stand-
 ards are difficult to enforce. Public employee unions have won collective bargaining
 agreements in the FTZ's of Barranquilla, Buenaventura, Cartagena, and Santa
 Marta, but the garment manufacturing enterprises in Medellin and Risaralda,
 which have the largest number of employees, are not organized. National labor lead-
 ers claim that in these FTZ's the provisions of the Labor Code dealing with wages,
 hours, health, and safety are not honored.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsor Labor.-The Constitution forbids slavery
 and any form of forced or compulsory labor, and this prohibition is respected in
 practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Constitution bans the employ-
 ment of children under the age of 14 in most jobs, and the Labor Code prohibits
 the granting of work permits to youths under the age of 18. This provision is re-
 spected in larger enterprises and in major cities. Nevertheless, the extensive infor-
 mal economy remains effectively outside government control. Some 800,000 children
 between the ages of 12 and 17 work, according to Labor Ministry studies. These
 chldren work--often under substandard conditions-in agriculture or in the infor-
 mal sector, as street vendors, in leather tanning, and in small family-operated
 mines. Working children are exposed to the same risks that affect adult workers,
 including exposure to toxic substances and accidental injuries, all of which contrib-
 ute to impaired physical development. The ICBF continued its outreach campaign
 to inform child laborers of their rights and where to turn for help. No figures were
 available to measure the impact of this effort.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets a uniform minimum
 wage for workers every January to serve as a benchmark for wage bargaining. The
 
 
 407
 
 minimum wage was approximately $140 (col$ 140,000) per month. The minimum
 wage does not provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. Because
 the minimum wage is based on the Government's target inflation rate, the minimum
 wage has not kept up with inflation in recent years. By government estimates, the
 price of the family shopping basket is 2.4 times the minimum wage. However, 60
 percent of all workers earn no more than, and often much less than, twice the mini-
 mum wage.
 The law provides for a standard workday of 8 hours and a 48-hour workweek, but
 it does not specifically require a weekly rest period of at least 24 hours, a failing
 criticized by the ILO. Legislation provides comprehensive protection for workers' oc-
 cupational safety and health, but these standards are difficult to enforce, in part
 due to the small number of Labor Ministry inspectors. In addition, unorganized
 workers in the informal sector fear that they will lose their jobs if they exercise
 their right to denounce abuses, particularly in the agicultural sector. According to
 the Labor Code, workers have the right to withdraw from a hazardous work situa-
 tion without jeopardizing continued employment. In general, a lack of public safety
 awareness, inadequate attention by unions, and lax enforcement by the Labor Min-
 istry result in an alarmingly high level of industrial accidents and unhealthy work-
 ing conditions. Over 80 percent of industries lack industrial security plans. The So-
 cial Security Institute reported 115,000 work-related accidents for 1995, 17,000 of
 which resulted in deaths. Informed observers reported that the level of work-related
 accidents was expected to remain at comparably high levels in 1996.
