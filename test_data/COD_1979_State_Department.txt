 ZAIRE
 During the past year Zaire took positive steps in the
 area of human rights. Tens of thousands of former
 residents of Shaba province who had been living in north-
 eastern Angola resettled in Zaire under an amnesty. A number
 of persons convicted in a 1975 coup plot trial were released.
 One new army brigade and part of another have been trained,
 are being paid on a regular basis, and have significantly
 improved relations with the civilian population of
 Shaba. Increased access to prisons for international
 organizations has been permitted. This report covers events up to
 the end of December, 1979, and, therefore includes neither
 the appointment of a new Cabinet, nor plans for restructuring the
 judicial administration, both announced in January of 1980.
 A constructive dialogue on the matter of human rights
 between the government of Zaire and other parties has been
 maintained. However, there remain serious problems:
 poverty and malnutrition, arbitrary arrest and detention
 sanctioned by the legal system, military abuse of civilians,
 lack of sufficient protection for individual rights, and
 pervasive corruption.
 Most Zairians lack adequate food, clothing, shelter, medical
 care, access to education, transportation, or a job that
 pays a living wage, and their access to these necessities is
 diminishing. External factors, including a sharp drop in
 copper prices in 1974, blockages in crucial transportation
 links through neighboring countries for Zaire's exports,
 and the sharp rise in petroleum prices caused severe economic
 dislocation. However, bad judgment, poor management and
 corruption, abetted by international businesses, caused most
 of the effective destruction of what had once been a thriving
 economy with a healthy agricultural sector.
 After the 1977 Shaba war President Mobutu announced a
 series of measures to (1) promote economic recovery; (2)
 bring about military reform; and (3) liberalize the govern-
 ment and decentralize its power. Further economic reforms
 are called for under the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
 stabilization agreement signed by President Mobutu in
 July 1979 which will provide Zaire $150 million in standby
 credits if Zaire fulfills its stringent conditions. (The
 IMF standby agreement was the third in four years: the
 first two aborted due to failure of the government of
 Zaire to adhere to the stated conditions.) Adherence to the
 stabilization plan, coupled with the recently agreed to
 rescheduling of Zaire's mammoth foreign debt, could lead to
 an amelioration in living conditions in succeeding years.
 The short-term effect of adhering to the stabilization plan,
 however, will be further privation for a people already in
 want.
 Since independence, the country has suffered from internal
 divisions, fueled by antagonisms among many of the more
 than 200 ethnic groups, that erupted into near-continuous
 civil war and near-anarchy from 1960 to 1967. Thus Mobutu
 has seen his main task as the reestablishment of the central
 government's authority over this vast country. As a result,
 effective political power is concentrated in the hands of
 the President and there is only one political party within
 
 
 225
 which belong the government, labor, youth and other col-
 lective activity except religious worship. All regional
 authorities are central government appointees.
 In part due to irregular salary payments, much of the
 Zairian Army and police survives by extorting from the
 civilian population. In 1978 and 1979, French and Belgian
 advisors began training two new 2,500-man army brigades as
 the first step in a Zairian program to reform its armed
 forces. All but one battallion of these units are now on
 active duty with their advisors and have established sign-
 ificantly improved relations with civilians. The Chinese
 are undertaking the task of training another brigade-sized
 unit beginning in 1980, but it is still too early to tell
 how durable these retraining and reform efforts will prove
 and whether they can be extended to other units of the
 30,000-man Zairian army.
 In 1977 contested elections were held for Parliament, the
 party political bureau and urban councils. In 1977 and
 1978, national elections were held in the labor union
 federation. Parliament has been'free to debate and criti-
 cize a wide range of policies, but is ultimately subordinate
 to the Executive which it has no power to limit. The office
 of Prime Minister was revived in 1978 and became more
 important in 1979 when the President granted the incumbent
 substantial responsibility for the day-to-day running of
 governmenE and the preparation and submission of the annual
 budget.
 Power, however, remains essentially in the President's
 hands.   The Prime Minister, like the rest of the cabinet,
 is appointed by the President. Legislation can be enacted
 by presidential signature alone when the parliament is not
 in session. The judiciary is subordinate to the executive
 branch. Although legal steps were taken in October 1979
 toward the establishment of appointed regional economic and
 social councils to provide a forum for regional interests,
 they have yet to begin functioning.
 In contrast to 1978, there were no major political trials in
 1979. The six month amnesty declared in June 1978, for
 Shabans who had fled to Angola after the 1977 and 1978 wars,
 was subsequently extended for six more months at the request
 of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),
 inducing the return of about 150,000 Shabans from Angola and
 Zambia.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a) Torture
 According to various eyewitness accounts, physical abuse of
 prisoners by prison staff has been carried out during this
 past year. Allegations of torture are also prevalent.
 Some of the returnees under the Shaba amnesty are also
 believed to have been detained on arrival in Zaire, and in
 some cases beaten or tortured. The Zairian Government's
 record of disciplinary action against personnel accused of
 inflicting physical abuse or torture can be regarded as
 spotty.
 
 
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 immediately after arrest, most detained persons are kept
 in local jails not designed to hold prisoners more than the
 statutory 24 hours (during which the prisoner is supposed to
 be brought before a magistrate to hear the charges against
 him). The prisoner is then supposed to be moved to another
 facility or released. Since these jails are meant only
 to be temporary holding areas, they do not provide food and
 often lack plumbing, furniture and bedding. In many
 instances, arrested persons spend days in such jails and,
 in some cases, weeks, depending entirely on visitors for
 food, water and other basic necessities. Sometimes jails
 are crowded with not enough room to lie down. Regional and
 national prisons are designed to house prisoners for an
 extended period and vary in quality depending upon the
 competence and honesty of the prison authorities. Virtually
 all hold more than the intended capacity and most provide
 inadequate food, clothing and medical care. One of the
 larger prisons is reported to have improved the diet of
 its inmates in recent months through increased attention to
 its prison farm. Another large prison has experienced
 marked improvement in living conditions in recent months.
 In July the Zairian Department of Justice began what it
 stated would be a series of inspection tours of regional
 and national prisons by high level officials. Conditions
 in local jails, however, do not appear to be the target of
 any reform effort. In most cases, regardless of crime,
 prisoners are permitted to receive visitors, without whose
 help they would go hungry. A few executions in Bas Zaire of
 persons convicted of armed robbery were announced in 1979,
 and two soldiers are known to have been executed in Shaba.
 Allegations are occasionally made of secret summary
 executions, carried out in special places of detention.
 The Department of State has no concrete information to
 confirm or disprove these reports. In contrast to 1978, no
 public executions were held in 1979. By September 1979 the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had received
 authorization to visit certain military prisons where
 persons convicted of the 1978 "coup-terrorist plot" were
 being held. It had also received permission to visit
 ordinary jails and prisons throughout the country, having
 already visited those in the Shaba region. Permission has
 not yet been granted, however, to visit places of detention
 run by the state security organizations.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 People can be legally detained for questioning by the
 security police (CND) for an unlimited period of time
 without the authorization from a tribunal which would
 normally be required in case of arrest by ordinary police.
 No reliable estimates exist as to whether many persons
 are currently being held.
 However, in the vast majority of arrests, (i.e., those
 for ordinary offenses) the arrested person should by law
 be brought before an examining magistrate within 24 hours
 to be informed of the charge against him. Then, within
 five days, the arrestee's record should be forwarded to
 the appropriate public prosecutor for confirmation of the
 arrest or, failing that, release. Periodic reviews of the
 arrest order should be made after two weeks and, thereafter,
 monthly by the public prosecutor who must confirm the arrest
 
 
 227
 each time or release the prisoner.
 These procedures, and especially time limits, are often
 infringed, as in the cases of several prominent lawyers
 detained on orders of the President of the Judiciary Council
 last spring. People are detained for longer periods without
 their arrest being confirmed and sometimes without being
 confronted with the charges against them. In some cases,
 after being charged, the prisoner remains under provisional
 arrest for months without trial and can occasionally be
 forgotten for months or even years. In most cases, if
 defendants are well-informed enough to know they have the
 right to counsel, they will be permitted to see a lawyer.
 Those who do not know, as is often the case with the poorer
 and less-educated, often will not have any legal counsel.
 In a few cases involving crimes against the state, defense
 lawyers have been, in the past, denied access to their
 clients, but the Department of State knows of no such cases
 in 1979.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are almost always public in Zaire (except for some
 military tribunals or where evidence would offend public
 decency, as in rape cases) but are not always fair. A
 judicial reorganization of 1978 reduced the number of
 judges presiding at the first instance level from three to
 one. At the'same time, the judges became, in effect,
 employees of the executive branch: hired, paid, transferred,
 promoted, demoted, and subject to dismissal on the recom-
 mendation of the Department of Justice. Judges in 1979
 tended to be young, inexperienced and very poorly paid.
 During the year under review, some judges were retired
 prematurely upon the recommendation of the President of the
 Judicial Counsel (head of the Justice Department) apparently
 after having ruled against the government in particular
 cases. These factors make the judiciary vulnerable to both
 bribery and political pressure from the executive branch.
 Defendants are entitled to counsel. A system exists for
 providing free counsel to indigents if they ask for it.
 There appears to be no harassment of defense counsel by
 the government. However, legislation recently enacted by
 presidential signature (and never submitted to the Legis-
 lative Council) could reduce the autonomy of Zaire's pri-
 vate lawyers. Crimes against the state or threats to the
 security of the state are tried by the State Security
 Council in Kinshasa where, in general, the same standards of
 legal practice apply as for ordinary courts.
 President Mobutu on October 14, 1979, released 18 military
 officers convicted for an alleged coup plot in 1975; seven
 of those released had been under sentence of death since
 1975. On November 22, President Mobutu signed an order
 releasing 65 persons convicted of various crimes after the
 1977 Shaba War.
 Civilians are occasionally tried by military courts.
 Non-judicial sanctions against persons suspected by the
 security police of threatening the security of the state
 are authorized by law. These sanctions range from
 restriction on movement or travel, to house arrest or
 administrative detention.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home is generally respected in peacetime.
 
 
 228
 Judicial warrants usually are obtained prior to searching a
 home, except cases of serious threat to national security.
 However, it is widely believed that last February's attack
 on the home of a major religious figure by 20 men in
 military uniforms was a Zairian government instigated
 attempt at intimidation.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The basic needs of the Zairians are not being met and even
 the most optimistic of observers expect the serious deter-
 ioration of living standards that has been the trend of the
 past five years to continue. Causes of this trend include
 incompetent management, pervasive corruption at all levels
 of the society, and leakage and misallocation of scarce
 foreign exchange. It seems that a start has been taken on
 measures aimed at slowing the decline of Zaire's economy.
 In 1979, additional steps were taken toward improving the
 recapture of foreign exchange earnings. International
 organizations provided expatriate experts to help with the
 management of a few key economic institutions. Recruiting
 difficulties, not the fault of Zaire, prevented their
 introduction on as wide a scale as necessary or desired.
 Although reliable statistics are generally unavailable,
 thece is widespread agreement that the standard of living
 for Zairians has dropped appreciably over the past decade.
 The approximately three-fourths of the population that is
 rural is among the world's poorest and lacks adequate
 access to public services such as medical care, schools,
 communications and transportation. Rural Zairians often
 lack adequate food and shelter as well. One quarter of the
 population is urban, and migration from rural to urban areas
 continues. Malnutrition is more prevalent among the urban
 population than the people of the countryside. Malnu-
 trition is prooably the most serious health problem nation-
 wide and contributes to the high rate of death and illness
 from other causes.
 The rural exodus and the serious nutrition problem both
 result, in large measure, from ill-advised policies and
 practices that destroyed what had been a thriving agri-
 cultural sector before 1960. These include: neglect of
 agricultural investment; expropriation and subsequent
 mismanagement of plantations; ill-conceived price controls
 and export taxes; near-total neglect of the surface trans-
 portation and communications systems; and corrupt, incom-
 petent administration of government services. These are
 more at fault in the decay of the rural sector than the
 dislocation caused by the two Shaba wars. Decisions affect-
 ing the rural sector are made by the central government,
 often without taking into account local conditions or
 consulting agricultural producers. At present no effective
 mechanism exists for accurately reporting to the political
 leadership the often disastrous results of such policies.
 Health care tends to be curative, not preventative, and
 extremely limited in scope and availability. Many hospitals
 and dispensaries are not functioning for lack of supplies.
 Tneft and sale of medical supplies by poorly-paid public
 medical personnel are common. A few private church-run
 nospitals and clinics, dependent upon funds from abroad,
 
 
 229
 provide what little medical care there is in rural areas.
 (A 1975 study noted that 80 percent of the rural population
 had no access to a medical facility, and the situation
 has certainly deteriorated since then.)
 Education is expensive, of inferior quality, and in short
 supply at all levels, particularly in the rural areas
 where secondary schools and institutions of higher learning
 are virtually nonexistent. Decreasing numbers of parents
 can afford to send their children to schools. At the
 primary school level, less than half as many girls attend as
 boys. The sex imbalance increases at higher levels.
 Management of the educational system at the primary and
 secondary levels is mostly in the hands of the church groups
 that had founded the schools in earlier days and lost
 control of them to the government for several years in the
 mid-1970s. Upon the return of the schools to church con-
 trol, there began an'effort to revive those that had been
 systematically pillaged, neglected or closed during the
 state-controlled period. Teachers' salaries still are paid,
 sporadically and late, by the government. In 1979, accord-
 ing to informed observers, approximately one-eighth of each
 department's payroll, the education department's included,
 consists of fictitious names or persons illegally claiming
 two or more paychecks. Allegedly, the extra payments are
 pocketed by administrative personnel, not by teachers.
 Sometimes the computers issue authorization to pay teachers
 at schools Ehat do not exist. Literacy estimates for
 persons over age 15 vary between 40 and 50 percent, lower in
 rural areas and lowest for rural women, an estimated rate of
 15 percent.
 The number of university students, approximately 30,000,
 is impressive when compared to the few hundred attending the
 country's universities in 1960. The quality of education at
 the university level, however, has deteriorated so markedly
 in the past several years that private employers discount
 the value of a Zairian university degree. The 1979-80
 academic year has been particularly poor, with schooling
 disrupted because of non-payment of student stipends, lack
 of student lodging and boarding facilities, and strikes by
 low-paid teaching assistants.
 Inflation has moved far ahead of salary increases for the
 fourth consecutive year, and this trend is expected to
 continue, at a slightly lower rate, into 1980. The result
 is a great and increasing drop in real income for almost all
 Zairians except the elite.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Zairians tend to speak frankly in private. In most cases,
 persqns expressing strong criticism of the government in a
 private setting or in a structured situation, such as was
 provided by the 1978-79 parliamentary interpellations, do
 not suffer harassment or imprisonment. Criticism of the
 President, however, is a criminal offense and no legal
 opposition to the one political party is permitted. The
 press and media are generally controlled by the government..
 Newspapers often carry reports on inadequacies in the
 government services and of corrupt practices by public
 
 
 230
 servants. Their reporting is selective, never embar-
 rassing or implicating the President or his close associates
 by name. In 1979, a ban on Belgian journalists was imposed
 for a few months after a Belgian film crew produced a
 documentary film for European television that was unflatter-
 ing to Zaire.
 Under Zairian law, only certain religious groups -- Roman
 Catholic, Protestant, Kimbanguist, Muslim, Jewish and
 Eastern Orthodox -- are legally permitted to function. A
 list of several hundred illegal sects was published by the
 Department of Justice in 1979, and the penalties for dis-
 obeying the injunction against illegal religious activities
 were increased. There has, however, been great restraint
 used by the government in implementing this law. Religious
 communities continue to worship without harassment.
 The trade union and all other organizations of a social or
 political nature operate within the framework of the sole
 political party, the Popular Revolutionary Movement (MPR).
 All youth, sports and other social clubs must also be
 under the umbrella to have legal status. Right of assembly
 is conditioned by the requirement that groups be legally
 recognized. A military regulation has for years forbidden
 military officers from accepting the hospitality of for-
 eigners, particularly diplomats and journalists, without
 the express permission of the Department of Defense.
 Members of the party's political bureau must have pres-
 idential approval for the same purpose. An increasing
 number of permissions to accept foreigners' invitations
 appears to have been granted in 1979.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 No legal limits seriously impede internal travel although
 persons coming from rural areas theoretically require
 authorization to visit urban centers and special permits
 are required for the diamond mining area. Travel abroad is
 controlled, with a series of steps required to obtain a
 passport and exit permit but, except for instances of
 extortion, these bureaucratic requirements rarely limit
 or impede travel abroad. Passport fees =re low. No formal
 obstacle to return from abroad exists.
 An amnesty was in effect during the entire year. Some
 prominent disidents and/or their families have come back for
 visits or to stay but many of the dissident leaders remain
 abroad. Nonetheless, the amnesty has encouraged some
 150,000 refugees and former rebels from Shaba to return to
 Zaire. Zaire has admitted a total of more than 200,00C
 refugees and repatriates from neighboring countries since
 1977, mos: recently Ugandans. Although unable to provide
 much material assistance from its own resources, the govern-
 ment of Zaire has cooperated effectively with the United
 Nations Hign Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the inter-
 national Rescue Committee, and other international organi-
 zations and church groups active in assisting refugees.
 The UNHCR recently published a report stating that Zaire had
 more refugees than any other country in Africa.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Contested elections were held in 1977 for members of parlia-
 ment, half the membership of the party political bureau and
 for members of the urban councils. The majority of Zaire's
 
 
 231
 voting-age population participated. The MPR is the only
 political party permitted and all Zairians are automatically
 members. Its structure is more designed to mobilize
 support for the regime than to elicit the people's views.
 There are no social or ethnic groups denied citizenship, or
 barred from political participation, provided, in the case
 of organized groups, their organization is accrdited by the
 party. There are some regional and ethnic quotas in higher
 education and elsewhere.
 The sole labor union federation (UNTZa) represents the
 workers at the bargaining table. Although the union is
 restricted in its right to strike, strikes did take place in
 1979, resulting in improvements in worker's pay and benefits
 in several cases. The labor union federation's central
 committee is elected, and its national elections were held
 for the second year in a row in 1978. Efforts were begun in
 1979 to replace appointed regional committees with elected
 officials. This reform has been hindered by tne lack of
 funds available to regional branches, making the salaries
 offered to regional branch officials often far lower than
 what those persons could earn working for other employers.
 Women's freedom is seriously circumscribed by tradition and
 custom but has, up to now, by and large been protected by
 law. Zaire has a woman cabinet minister, seven female
 members of the legislature, and numbers of women doctors,
 university professors, owners of business enterprises,
 etc. In 1979, women organized a committee within the labor
 union federation which has begun investigating the status of
 working women in Zaire in preparation for recommending
 improvementp. Proposed "reforms" of the legal code regarding
 family matters, if enacted, would substitute "authentic"
 Zairian tradition for Napoleonic principles as the basic
 philosophy behind the code of civil law. The proposed code
 would require that women obtain their husbands' authorization
 before seeking employment and, in other ways, would reflect
 in written law traditions that disadvantage women.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 A notable change in attitude has occurred in the past year,
 with the government of Zaire becoming more willing to engage
 in a constructive dialogue on human rights and more hospitable
 to and cooperative with foreign individuals and organizations
 concerned with human rights.
 Early in the year, the International Committee of the Red
 Cross was permitted to visit dozens of prisons and jails in
 Shaba in order to investigate conditions and report on them
 to the government of Zaire. Later, permission was given to
 the ICRC to visit prisons outside Shaoa including ones wnere
 convicted coup plotters had been imprisoned. In late 1979,
 ICRC was continuing to seek permission to visit jails and
 prisons where persons administratively detained oy security
 police were held. in Novemuer 1979, tne Zairian Farcan
 r:nister publicly invited human rights groups and intr.--
 nationa! organizations to investigate allegations tha:
 gendarmes nad, in the summer of 1979, massacred students in
 Kasai orovince. From reports available to the Dejartten: oz
 State it appears tnat an undeterrined number of persons were
 killed near Mbuji Mayi in July when soldiers aliegec-y :ireJ
 on a group apparently engaged in illegal diamond mining.
 However, the Department of State hias 6een unable to confir;-
 an- further details of the incident.
 Zaire hosted seminars on numan rights and welcomed inter-
 national human rights experts. Zairian lawyers and judges
 invited abroad to participate in human rights seminars or Lo
 discuss human rights issues with interested groups and
 individuals were not hindered in any way. When proposals for
 an African charter for human rights and a Pan-African human
 rignts investigation body to deal with suspected violations
 in Africa were made in July 1979 at the Monrovia Summit of
 the Organization of African Unity, Zaire responded favorably.
