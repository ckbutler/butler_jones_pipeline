 THE GAMBIA
 The Gambia is a parliamentary democracy with an elected President and Par-
 liament. Except for a coup attempt in 1981 The Gambia has had a history of politi-
 cal stability under the leadership of its onfy President since independence in 1965,
 Sir Dawda Jawara. His ruling People's Progressive Party (PPP) has dominated the
 unicameral Parliament, but several opposition parties, as well as independent politi-
 cians, participate in the political process.
 The Gambia police force is responsible for maintaining law and order. It is firmly
 under civilian control. There have been some reports of police beating prisoners or
 detainees, but abuse of prisoners is not systematic, and reported incidents are inves-
 tigated swiftly, with perpetrators punished as appropriate.
 The Gambia's population of just over 1 million consists largely of subsistence
 farmers growing rice, millet, maize, and groundnuts (peanuts), the country's pri-
 mary export crop. The private sector, led by reexporting, fisheries, horticulture, and
 tourism, has begun to flourish.
 The Government has made particular efforts to promote observance of human
 rights, which are constitutionally protected and generally observed in practice. The
 primary human rights problems include pretrial detention for lengthy periods, due
 to administrative inefficiences, and societal discrimination against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reported political
 killings or extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other cruel, inhuman, and degrading punish-
 ment. Although there is no systematic abuse of prisoners or detainees, beatings of
 detainees by police or prison officials have occurred. When they occur, government
 officials usually have responded swiftly, investigating the incident, and, if war-
 ranted, pressing charges.
 Prison conditions are severe, even after the Government implemented reforms fol-
 lowing the death of several inmates in 1988 from beri-beri. The press continued to
 report that inmates in local prisons received inadequate medical care and nutrition.
 In response to the newspaper articles, the Government commissioned a study of the
 health and nutrition of prisoners: the nongovernmental African Centre for Democ-
 racy and Human Rights Studies (ACDHRS) found that medical care and food hy-
 giene were unsatisfactory but that there was no malnutrition. The Government al-
 lows prison visits by local Red Cross representatives and close family members.
 Recognizing that some police officers abuse citizens' rights in the execution of
 their duties, the new Inspector General of Police (IGP) initiated a training program
 to improve the quality of service provided by his officers and to raise police aware-
 ness of human rights, especially the rights of the accused. The IGP also formed a
 community affairs unit to review and act on complaints about police behavior.
 Parliament in April voted to abolish the use of capital punishment.
 
 
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Based on British legal practice, well-de-
 veloped constitutional and legal procedures govern the arrest, detention, and public
 trial of persons accused of crimes. Under these procedures, an arrested person must
 not be held more than 24 hours before being presented to a magistrate or granted
 bail and must be promptly informed of charges. A detained person must be brought
 to trial within 1 week of arrest, but this waiting period may be extended twice, mak-
 ing 21 days the maximum period of detention without bail before trial. If released
 on bail, an accused person may face charges indefinitely since there is no maximum
 time limit for completing the investigation and bringing the case to trial.
 In practice, because of overcrowded court schedules and administrative inefficien-
 cies, the detention period before trial can be prolonged. The press reported several
 incidents in 1993 in which arrested Gambians were denied their rights under the
 Constitution. In one instance, the Gambian Supreme Court freed a man, suspected
 of murder but never formally charged, who had been detained in Mile Two Prison
 for 17 months. He was subsequently rearrested and remanded for custody at Mile
 Two Prison. In another case, the Supreme Court granted bail to a man charged with
 murder who had been held without trial at Mile Two Prison for almost 4 years. A
 third case came to light in which a young man had been detained for 20 days with-
 out charge.
 To help guard against a reccurence of such cases, the Inspector General has dele-
 gated to the arresting officer the authority to grant bail or order the release of an
 arrested person who cannot be charged.
 As far as is known, there were no political or security detainees or prisoners held
 by the Government at year's end.
 The Government does not practice political exile. The leader of the failed 1981
 coup, Kukoi Samba Sanyang, remained abroad.
 e. Denial of Fair Public 7rial.-There are three kinds of law in the Gambia: gen-
 eral, customary, and Shari'a (Islamic). Shari'a law is observed in Muslim marriage
 and divorce proceedings. Customary law covers marriage and divorce for non-Mus-
 lims, inheritance, land tenure and utilization, local tribal government, and all other
 traditional civil and social relations. General law, based on the English system but
 modified by Gambian practice, governs criminal cases and trials and most organized
 business practices. If there is a conflict between general law and Shari'a, general
 law prevails.
 Appeals normally proceed from the Supreme (trial) Court to the Court of Appeals,
 the country's highest tribunal. Judges are appointed by the Government, but the ju-
 diciary operates independently and is free of government interference.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution contains provisions (which are generally respected) against arbitrary
 search of person and property. It does permit a search to which a suspect submits
 voluntarily or if the search is reasonably required in the interest of national defense
 or public welfare. Under the Crimina Code, search warrants based on probable
 cause are issued by magistrates upon application by the police.
 The Code also specifies that police may conduct a search of a private residence
 while a crime is in progress. There are a few checkpoints in the country where the
 police and military periodically stop and search drivers and vehicles.
 The rights of family are of great importance in the Gambia's conservative Muslim
 society. Marriage, the rearing of children, and religious instruction are regulated
 primarily by personal preference and ethnic and religious tradition; the Government
 does not normally intrude in family matters. There is no effort to censor or control
 personal correspondence or communications.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press. Ordinary citizens openly criticize government policies during public meet-
 ings or in private conversations. During the 1992 election, opposition political par-
 ties freely criticized the Government's record. In 1993 a third major newspaper, a
 monthly, began publication.
 There is no television in the Gambia, although Senegalese broadcasts can be re-
 ceived with standard television antennas, and international broadcasts can be re-
 ceived via satellite dishes, which are becoming more common. The government radio
 station, Radio Gambia, provides the only daily local news coverage, which is also
 broadcast by the two commercial radio stations. During the 1992 elections and 1993
 by-elections, opposition parties had access to Radio Gambia, although there were
 some complaints in this respect. Foreign magazines and newspapers are available
 in the capital. There is no university in the Gambia.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government does not
 interfere with freedom of assembly and association, which is provided for in the
 
 
 109
 Constitution. The Government almost always vants permits for peaceful assembly
 but requires that these meetings be open to the public. Permits for assembly are
 issued by the police and are not denied for political reasons. No organization is cur-
 rently proscribed in the Gambia. The law on proscribed organizations has been
 amended so that future bans will require a judicial decision rather than a presi-
 dential decree. The State must now apply to a court for a proscription order, citing
 specific grounds for the request.
 c. Freedom of Religion.--Constitutional provisions of freedom of conscience,
 thought, and religion are observed in practice. The State is secular, although Mus-
 lims constitute over 90 percent of the population. The schools provide instruction in
 the Koran for Muslim students. Christians, both Catholic and Protestant, freely
 practice their religion. There is a small Baha'i community in Banjul. Missionaries
 are permitted to carry out their activities freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement, subject to condi-
 tions protecting public safety, health, and morals. There is no restriction on freedom
 of emigration or freedom of return. Because of historic and ethnic ties with the in-
 habitants of Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Sierra Leone, and Mauritania, people
 tend to move freely across borders, which are poorly marked and difficult to police.
 The Gambia continued to host refugees from Liberia and Senegal. However, dur-
 ing 1993 the arrival of Liberian refugees into the Gambia virtually ceased, and
 many Liberians living in the Gambia departed voluntarily. At year's end, some 250
 Liberians remained in The Gambia. Refugees from southern Senegal's Casamance
 region also began returning home in 1993, following the Jul ease-ire between the
 Casamance separatist grup and the Government of Senegl The C asamancais ref-
 ugee population in The Gambia decreased from some 3,500 at the beginning of 1993
 to 2,000 by the end of the year. The Gambia maintained its tradition of hospitality
 towards refugees and worked with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-
 gees, the Gambian Red Cross, and other nongovernmental organizations to provide
 assistance and protection to refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government through peaceful means. The
 President and Members of Parliament are popularly elected, as are the district
 councils and the chiefs who exercise traditionalauthority in the villages and com-
 pounds. Presidential and parliamentary elections are held eve 5 years. Citizens
 must bo at least 18 years of age to vote. Balloting is secret, and measures are em-
 ployed to assure that iliterate voters understand the choices and voting procedure.
 A functioning multiparty system exists, even though the Peoples'Progressive
 Party (PPP) under the leadership of President Jawara has been in power since inde-
 pendence. All opposition parties contest general elections, and some contest district
 elections. In the April 1992 presidential and parliamentary elections, candidates
 from th e at political parties as well as independent candidates campaigned vigor-
 ously. Observers as well as most participants declared the election free and air.
 President ,Jawara was reeleted President, but his PPP lost six seats in Parliament.
 The overall distribution of elected parliamentary seats was 25 for the PPP, 6 for
 the National Convention Party (NCP), 2 for the Gambian People's Party (GPP), and
 3 independents.
 In accordance with election law, seven defeated parliamentary candidates filed pe-
 titions at the Supreme Court challenging the results in their districts. The Court
 dismissed petitions of two NCP candidates, but the Chief Justice heard five peti-
 tions from PPP candidates. Of the five cases, the Chief Justice heard one in 1992,
 ruling against the petitioner, and four in 1993, rulin a ainst the petitioners in two
 cases and for the petitioners in the other two. In the latter cases he declared the
 parliamentary seats vacant and ordered by-elections. In the June by-elections, citi-
 zens overwhelmingly elected the same candidates they had chosen in the general
 election. Again, independent press observers deemed the elections free and fair.
 While women are represented in the political process, there are no women in the
 14-person Cabinet, and only 4 women in the 51-seat Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 In 1989 the Government established an independent, nongovernmental organiza-
 tion, the African Centre for Democracy and Human Rights Studies (ACI)HRS), to
 promote greater respect for human rights in Africa. The Centre publishes a news-
 letter and relevant international human rights materials, organizes regional human
 rights forums and workshops, conducts research on human rights and democracy in
 
 
 Africa, and sustains a training and internship program for local and international
 participants. The ACDHRS was also active in inspecting prison conditions in 1993
 (see Section l.c.) There are no other local human rights organizations active in the
 Gambia.
 International human rights organizations may visit to observe the condition of de-
 tainees and the trial process. The Gambia is also home to the Organization of Afri-
 can Unity's Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, the organization charged
 with protecting and promoting human rights in member countries under the African
 Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that all persons in the Gambia are entitled to "fundamen-
 tal rights and freedoms," regardless of "race, place of origin, political opinions, col-
 our, creed, or sex." There is no officially sanctioned discrimination based on race,
 sex, religion, disability, language, or social status.
 Women.-Despite Constitutional provisions, women face extensive discrimination.
 Traditional views, especially about the role of women in society, are changing but
 very slowly. Marriages are usually "arranged," and Muslim tradition allows for po-
 lyyy Women are disadvantaged educationally, with females comprising one-third
 ofprimary students and one-fourth of high school students. The Government has
 encouraged parents to send their daughters to school. The Women's Bureau in the
 Office of the Vice President conducts an ongoing campaign in both the rural and
 urban areas to make women aware of their legal rights i respect to divorce and
 custody of children, property matters, and in cases of assault.  also  ublishes a
 quarterly magazine on women's issues, which it distributes throughout the country.
 Domestic violence, including wife beating, occurs but is rare, according to health
 officials. Police intervene when they receive reports of beatings, and the authorities
 prosecute when the victim or others file complaints. The media covers such court
 cases, reporting newsworthy incidents.
 Children.-The Government of The Gambia is committed    the human rights and
 welfare of all Gambians. Care and welfare of The Gambia's children are considered
 to be primarily familial, rather than governmental, responsibiities, but authorities
 intervene when cases of abuse or ma treatment of chilrn arise and are reported.
 Female genital mutilation (circumcision) which has been condemned by health ex-
 perts as damaging to physical and psychological health, is practiced, usually at an
 early age. According to an independent expert, t he percentage of Gambian females
 who have undergone this procedure may be as high as 60 percent. The Womens Bu-
 reau holds workshops on female mutilation to inform women of its negative effects
 and to discuss the religious and traditional ties to the practice.
 Some young boys, known as almudos, experience severe hardship, deprivation,
 and degradation. They are given by their parents to Koranic scholars to learn the
 Islamic holy book. In return for their education, they must work for their scholars,
 almost always by begging in the street. Reports indicate that these boys often sleep
 20 or 30 to a room, have hardly any clothing, eat barely enough to survive, and en-
 dure serious health problems. Many are beaten by their teachers if they do not
 bring home enough money and by other adults they encounter on the streets. Re-
 ports indicate that as many as 60 percent of almudos are not Gambian. The Govern-
 ment has recognized the problem, and the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare,
 assisted by the United Nations Children's Fund, is conducting a study into the
 plight ofte amudos and other street children in th  Gambia. The study, begun
 in 1993, was still in progress at year's end.
 People with Disabilities.-here are no statutes or regulations currently in force
 requiring accessibility for the disabled.
 No legal discrimination against the physically disabled exists in employment, edu-
 cation, and other state services. Most severely handicapped individuals subsist
 throughprivate charity; less severely handicapped persons are fully accepted in so-
 ciety andencounter no discrimination in employment for which they are physically
 capable.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Labor Act of 1990 applies to all workers except
 civil servants. The Act specifies that workers are free to form associations, including
 trade unions, and provides for their registration with the Government. Police offi-
 cers and military personnel, as well as other civil service employees, are specifically
 prohibited from forming unions and going on strike.
 Approximately 20 percent of the work force is employed in the modern wage sec-
 tor of the economy, where unions are normally active. The Gambian Workers' Con-
 
 
 111
 federation (GWC) and the Gambian Workers' Union (GWU) are the two main inde-
 pendent and competing umbrella organizations. Both are recognized by, and have
 good working relationships with, the Government but are independent of the Gov-
 ernent and peltical parties.
 The Labor Act of 1990 authorizes strikes, but it speiies that a union must give
 the Commissioner of Labor 14 days' written notice before beginning an industrial
 action (28 days for essential services). Retribution is not permitted against strikers
 who comply with the law regulating strikes. However, upon application by an em-
 ployer to the Supreme Court, that hody may prohibit an industrial action that is
 ruled to be in pursuit of a political objective. The Court may also forbid an action
 that is in breach of a collectively agreed procedure for the settlement of industrial
 disputes that has not been exhausted.
 Because of these provisions, government conciliation efforts, and the weak bar-
 gaining position of the unions, few strikes actually occur. In June the Gambia suf-
 fered its only minor industrial action of the year. In a wildcat action, sanitation
 workers stopped work for 24 hours because they had not been paid on time. The
 strikers were successful in obtaining payment of salary arrears.
 Unions exercise the right to affiliate internationally, and there are no restrictions
 on their members' ability to participate in international activities.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Act of 1990 pro-
 vides workers the right to organize and bargain collectively. Although trade unions
 are small and fragmented, collective bargaining does take place. Each recognized
 union has specified guidelines for its activities. Prevailing wages exceed minimum
 wages and are determined by collective bargaining, arbitration, or market forces.
 The Labor Department registers the collective bargaining agreements reached be-
 tween the unions and management, after ensuring that the agreements do not vio-
 late the Labor Act. There are no reports of denial of registration. The Act also sets
 minimum standards for contracts in the areas of hiring, training, terms of employ-
 ment, wages, and termination of employment. The Act states that "any term of a
 contract of employment prohibiting an employee from becoming or remaining a
 member of any trade union or other organization representing workers . . . shall
 be null and void." Employers are not permitted to fire or otherwise discriminate
 against members of legal unions engaged in legally permitted union activities. Oth-
 erwise, the Government does not interfere in the bargaining process.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Criminal Code prohibits com-
 pulsory labor, and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum legal working age
 is 16. There is no compulsory education legislation, and, because of the paucity of
 secondary school opportunities, most children complete their formal education by
 age 14 and informally enter the work force. Employee labor cards, which include a
 person's age, are registered with the Labor Commissioner, but enforcement inspec-
 tions rarely take place because of lack of funding and inspectors. Children at early
 ages perform customary chores on family farms or engage in street trading.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-By law, minimum wages and hours of work are
 determined by six Joint Industrial Councils (commerce, artisans, transport, the pert
 industry, agrculture, and fisheries), which have representation from employees, em-
 ployers, and government. The lowest minimum wage is $0.95 (9 dalasi) per day for
 unskilled labor. Minimum wages do not provide for a decent standard of living for
 a worker and his family. Moreover, only that 20 percent of the total labor force, i.e.
 those in the wage sector, are covered by minimum wage legislation. The remainder
 are privately employed, chiefly in subsistence agriculture. Most Gambians do not
 live on one worker's earnings and rely on the extended family system, usually in-
 cluding some subsistence farming.
 The standard legal workweek is 48 hours within a period not to exceed 6 consecu-
 tive days. Allowance is made for half-hour lunch breaks. For the private sector, the
 6-day, 40-hour workweek includes 4 8-hour days with half days on Fridays and Sat-
 urdays. Government employees are entitled to 1 month's paid annual leave after 1
 year of service; private sector employees receive between 14 and 30 days of paid an-
 nual leave, depending on their length of service.
 The Labor Act provides a list of occupational categories and specifies safety equip-
 ment that an employer must supply to employees working in these categories. The
 Factory Act gives the Minister of Labor authority to regulate factory health and
 safety, accident prevention, and dangerous trades and to appint inspectors to en-
 sure compliance. However, enforcement is less than fully satisfactory becaus there
 are too few trained inspectors. Workers may refuse to work in dangerous work situ-
 ations. Workers in hazardous working environments are entitled to protective equip-
 ment and clothing.
