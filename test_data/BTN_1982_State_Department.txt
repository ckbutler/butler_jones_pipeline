 BHUTAN
 Bhutan is a Buddhist kingdom of some 18,000 square miles,
 bordering India and China, with a population of around 1.4
 million. During the rule (1952-72) of King Jigme Dorji
 Wangchuck, Bhutan began to emerge from centuries of medieval
 seclusion and progressed towards a more representative
 political system. Although the King retained strong executive
 powers, he created several important institutions such as the
 National Assembly (1953), the Royal Advisory Council (1965),
 and the Council of Ministers (1968) to provide broader
 participation in the Government. Serfdom was abolished, land
 reform introduced, codification of laws begun, and the
 judiciary separated from the executive. The present monarch,
 Jigme. Singye Wangchuck, has continued Bhutan's social and
 political evolution. Bhutan maintains diplomatic relations
 only with India and Bangladesh, but is a member of the United
 Nations and maintains UN representation in New York. Bhutan is
 a sovereign and independent nation, but under a 1949 treaty
 Bhutan has agreed to be guided in the conduct of its foreign
 affairs by India.
 Bhutan does not maintain diplomatic relations with the United
 States, and American officials rarely travel there. Informa-
 tion on Bhutanese practices in connection with human rights
 matters is, therefore, neither readily available nor complete.
 There has been little apparent change in the human rights
 situation in Bhutan since 1981.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, ,Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Killing
 There was no evidence of killings or political violence in
 Bhutan during 1982.
 b. Disappearance
 There, wasno evidence of disappearances of prisoners in the
 custody of Bhutanese officials during 1982.
 c. Torture
 -Representatives of the Dalai Lama have in the past alleged that
 some members of-the Tibetan exile community in Bhutan have been
 subjected-to arbitrary arrest and torture. There has been no
 independent verification of this allegation.
 d. I;Cruel; 1nhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Tkrer- is no evidence ..of resort to cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 punishmentor treatment. .Bhutanese society, largely agrarian
 -and-traditional, is peaceful and enjoys a very low crime rate.
 Punkshment-,for most'crimes -ranges from fines to imprisonment.
 Mutilation was-outlawed in 1965, and the death penalty has been
 abolished.
 e.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 There is no special or preventive detention in Bhutan, and
 arrests can be made only under legal authority.

 f.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Bhutan has no written constitution, and justice is administered
 under traditional law, which is in the process of codification
 and revision. Approximately 25 percent of Bhutan's population
 is of Nepalese origin. In ethnic Nepali areas, traditional
 Hindu law is administered, while Buddhist norms obtain in other
 regions of Bhutan. While Bhutan's legal system does not
 provide for juries or the right to be represented by legal
 counsel, trials are generally expeditious and public; qualified
 observers judge that they conform to the local population's
 concept of impartiality and justice. A separate judiciary was
 established in 1968 which provides for local, district, and
 national courts with original and appellate juridiction. Final
 appeals may be made to the King.
 g.   Invasion of the Home
 There are no written guarantees for privacy in the Bhutanese
 system, but tradition has bolstered the concept.
 2. Respect for Civil andPolitical Rights, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech and Press
 The only publications in Bhutan are a weekly and a monthly
 government journal. India has agreed to assist Bhutan in
 constructing a radio transmitter for a national radio station.
 Indian and other foreign newspapers and publications are
 allowed free access. Criticism of the King, an hereditary
 monarch, is permitted in the National Assembly, but civil and
 political liberties are not guaranteed in a written
 constitution.
 b.   Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 No written guarantees of these freedoms exist, but Bhutanese
 generally enjoy the freedom of peaceful assembly and
 association.
 c.   Freedom of Religion
 Although Buddhism is the state religion, members of other
 faiths, mainly Hindus of Nepali origin, enjoy freedom of
 worship.
 d.   Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement within Bhutan for Bhutanese
 citizens and no bar on emigration or foreign travel.
 Permanent residence for Nepalis and Indians in Bhutan (except
 those in government service) is restricted to the southern hill
 region. Bhutan traditionally has welcomed refugees and exiles
 from other countries in the region. Some 4,000 Tibetan
 refugees sought refuge in Bhutan after 1959, joining
 approximately 2,000 Tibetans already in the country.
 Because it perceived threats to national security resulting
 from the Tibetan refugees' lack of allegiance to Bhutan, the
 Bhutanese Government required in 1979-80 that the Tibetans
 either accept Bhutanese citizenship or face expulsion. When
 India and other countries initially refused to accept the
 Tibetans, Bhutan's policy raised the possibility of forcible
 repatriation. However, no such repatriation took place. Of
 
 
 1110
 the approximately 4,500 Tibetans in Bhutan in 1979, 1,000
 accepted Bhutanese citizenship; 1,500 were settled in northern
 India; and the remainder stayed in Bhutan without obtaining
 .citizenship. The Government of Bhutan has assured the Tibetans
 who accept citizenship that they will always be free to return
 to their homeland whenever they so choose.
 e.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There are no political parties in Bhutan and their formation
 appears to be discouraged. The 150-member National Assembly is
 made up of 100 members elected on a limited franchise (heads of
 family in Hindu areas, village headmen in Buddhist regions),
 ten elected by the organization of lamas (Buddhist leaders),
 two elected by the business community, and the remainder
 appointed by the King. Though the King's executive powers
 predominate in government, the Assembly enacts laws, approves
 senior appointments, and advises the King on matters of
 national importance. It also provides a forum for ventilating
 grievances and rectifying cases of maladministraton. The King
 cannot veto legislation passed by the National Assembly,
 although he can refer bills back to it for further
 consideration.' Local administration is carried out by
 centrally appointed government officials. villages, however,
 have the traditional right to elect their own headmen, who form
 the lowest rung of the administrative hierachy.
 3. Government Attitudes Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigations of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 As far as is known, no international agency or group has either
 sought or been denied entry into Bhutan to investigate alleged
 violations of human rights. No non-governmental human rights
 groups are known to exist in Bhutan.
 4. Economic,Social, and Cultural Situation
 The vast majority of Bhutan's population-is illiterate and
 rural and follows traditional agricultural and pastoral
 pursuits in a largely non-monetized economy. Virtually all
 families own enough land to feed and clothe themselves
 adequately by local standards. While poverty exists in remote
 areas, the destitution sometimes found in other parts of the
 sub-continent is absent in Bhutan. The Government has set land
 taxes low enough not to burden even small land-holders. It has
 abolished the traditional and substantial payment in kind by
 local populaces to monastic organizations. Under successive
 five-year development plans begun in 1961, Bhutan has improved
 its agriculture, roads and freight ropeways, communications,
 education, and health.
 Although comprehensive economic and social statistics do not
 exist, World Bank and AID figures do give some indication of
 Bhutan's development over the last 20 years. Bhutan is one of
 the world's least developed nations, with an annual per capita
 income in 1980 of only $83, and a ratio of calorie supply for
 consumption (relative to nutritional requirements) of 88
 percent (in 1977). Life expectancy at birth has risen from 36
 years (in 1960) to over 44 years (in 1980). The infant
 mortality rate in 1980 stood at 150 per 1,000 live births.
 Estimated net annual population growth has risen to 2.3 percent
 in 1980. Smallpox has been eradicated, and programs launched
 to control malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, and goiter. Bhutan
 
 
 1111
 receives some financial and technical assistance through the
 United Nations Development Program and the Colombo Plan.
 Primary education is free, and higher level students often
 receive free board and lodging. Although primary school
 enrollment quadrupled between 1960 and 1979, the ratio was
 still only 11 percent in 1979, and boys tend to outnumber girls
 by about two to one. Adult literacy stood at only 5 percent in
 1970.
 There are few social and economic indicators available to serve
 as a statistical basis for discussion of the status of females
 in Bhutanese society. Under Bhutanese law, no distinction is.
 made between the status of men and women. The general
 impression given by the literature on Bhutan suggests that the
 society and economy are relatively egalitarian.
