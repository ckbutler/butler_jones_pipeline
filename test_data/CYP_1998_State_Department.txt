 CYPRUS
 Prior to 1974, Cyprus experienced a long period of intercommunal strife between
 its Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. In response, the United Nations Force
 in Cyprus (UNFICYP) began peacekeeping operations in March 1964. The island
 has been divided since the Turkish military intervention of 1974, following a coup
 d'etat directed from Greece. Since 1974 the southern part of the island has been
 under the control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus. The northern part
 is ruled by a Turkish Cypriot administration. In 1983 that administration pro-
 claimed itself the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" ("TRNC"), which is recog-
 nized only by Turkey. The two parts are separated by a buffer zone patrolled by
 the UNFICYP. A substantial number of Turkish troops remain on the island. In
 both the government-controlled areas and in the Turkish Cypriot community there
 is a generally strong regard for democratic principles. Glafcos Clerides was reelected
 President of the Republic of Cyprus in February 1998; in 1995, Turkish Cypriots
 reelected Rauf Denktash as their leader. The judiciary is independent in both com-
 munities.
 Police in the government-controlled areas and in the Turkish Cypriot community
 are responsible for law enforcement. Police forces operating in the government-con-
 trolled areas are under civilian control, while military authorities direct Turkish
 Cypriot police forces. In general the police forces of both sides respect the rule of
 law, but instances of police abuse of power continued.
 Both Cypriot economies operate on the basis of free market principles, although
 in each community there are significant administrative controls. The government-
 controlled part of the island has a robust, service-oriented economy, with a declining
 manufacturing base and a small agricultural sector. Tourism and trade generate 22
 percent of gross domestic product and employ 27 percent of the labor force. In 1997
 
 
 1218
 per capita income was approximately $13,000, inflation was 3.6 percent, and unem-
 ployment was 3.5 percent. Growth in 1997 remained sluggish at 2.3 percent, com-
 pared to 2.0 percent in 1996. The Turkish Cypriot economy, which is handicapped
 significantly by an economic embargo by the Greek Cypriots, relies heavily on sub-
 sidies from Turkey and is burdened by an overly large public sector. It, too, is basi-
 cally service-oriented but has a relatively smaller tourism base and a larger agricul-
 tural sector. In 1997 per capita income in the north was approximately $3,700, and
 inflation was 82 percent. The economy in the north recorded a growth rate of 1.5
 percent in 1997 after a negative growth rate of 1.1 percent in 1996.
 The Government of the Republic of Cyprus generally respected human rights
 norms and practices; however, instances of police brutality continued to be a prob-
 lem.            -
 The Turkish Cypriot authorities generally respect human rights norms and prac-
 tices; however, police abuse of suspects' and detainees' rights continued. The au-
 thorities also restricted freedom of movement. Since December 1997 the Turkish
 Cypriot- authorities have banned most bicommunal contacts between Turkish Cyp-
 riots and Greek Cypriots, including previously frequent meetings in Nicosia's buffer
 zone. They sometimes attempted to prevent Turkish Cypriots from travelling to
 bicommunal meetings off the island as well. In February- Turkish Cypriot officials
 also instituted a new, higher fee system for crossings at the main Nicosia check-
 point, making it-more difficult for both sides to cross the buffer zone. The Turkish
 Cypriot authorities have taken some steps to improve the conditions of Greek Cyp-
 riots and Maronites living in the territory under their control, but the treatment of
 these groups still falls short -of Turkish Cypriot obligations under the Vienna III
 agreement of 1975.
 Violence against women remained a problem in both areas.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 Turkish Cypriot authorities still have not conducted a credible investigation of the
 1996 murder of a prominent leftist Turkish Cypriot journalist, Kutlu Adali, who
 wrote articles critical of Turkey's role in the north and particularly on the role of
 the Turkish military and of policies that allowed large numbers of Turkish workers
 into the north.
 In 1996 Turkish Cypriot civilian police killed a Greek Cypriot demonstrator who
 had entered the U.N. buffer zone, and the police participated in the beating death
 of another. Again, there has not been any significant investigation by Turkish Cyp-
 riot authorities of the killings. The Government of Cyprus stated that it would press
 for legal action against the killers, and the victims' families have filed a case against
 Turkey at the European Commission of Human Rights.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Both the Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus and the basic law governing the
 Turkish Cypriot community specifically prohibit torture, the law in both commu-
 nities prohibits such practices, and the authorities generally respect these provisions
 in practice; however, there continue to be instances of Cypriot police brutality
 against suspects in detention, mostly involving non-Cypriots (see Section 2.d.). Turk-
 ish Cypriots continue to allege that two Turkish Cypriots, arrested near the buffer
 zone by Greek Cypriot police in October 1997 on smuggling charges, were tortured.
 However, U.N. officials who examined the two men found no evidence that sup-
 ported their claims. The men, who were represented by a Turkish Cypriot attorney,
 were tried and convicted in accordance with Cypriot law. Following their May con-
 viction and sentencing to 12 months' imprisonment, they were released in July and
 returned to the north.
 Official action still is pending against the Cypriot police involved in a 1995 case
 of torture of a suspected Turkish Cypriot drug smuggler, Erkan Egmez. Egmez was
 released and returned to the north. He filed a complaint against the Cypriot Gov-
 ernment at the European Commission of Human Rights, and the Commission has
 ruled it admissible.
 The Commission also agreed in January to investigate complaints by nine Turkish
 Cypriots that Greek Cypriot police mistreated them in 1994 and expelled them to
 the north. The complainants allege that they were threatened with death if they re-
 turned to the south and that Greek Cypriot police were responsible for the death
 of one complainant's son, who did return .to the south later in 1994. The Cypriot
 
 
 1219
 
 Government denies all the charges; the Commission took oral evidence in the case
 in Nicosia in September.
 In both of the above cases, the Commission's admissibility ruling made no judg-
 ment on the merits of the individual case.
 While there were no public allegations of police brutality in the Turkish Cypriot
 community, there were credible reports of pervasive police abuse of power and rou-
 tine harsh treatment of detainees (see Section 1.d.).
 Prison conditions in general meet minimum international standards.
 The Cypriot Government and the Turkish Cypriot authorities permit prison visits
 by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Throughout Cyprus the police respect
 laws providing for freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention. Judiciall issued ar-
 rest warrants are required. No one may be detained for more than a day without
 referral of the case to the courts for extension of the period of detention. Most peri-
 ods of investigative detention do not exceed 8 to 10 days before formal charges are
 filed. Attorneys generally have access to detainees; bail is permitted.
 Some abuses of power occur at the hands of the Turkish Cypriot police, generally
 at the time of arrest. Suspects often are not permitted to have their lawyers present
 when testimony is being taken, a right provided under the Turkish Cypriot basic
 law. Suspects who demand the presence of a lawyer are threatened routinely with
 stiffer charges or even physically intimidated. A high percentage of convictions in
 the Turkish Cypriot community are obtained with confessions made during initial
 t olice interrogation under these conditions. There are also credible reports that po-
 lce routinely abuse their right to hold persons up to 24 hours before having to go
 before a judge. Police officers use this tactic against persons believed to have be-
 haved in a manner deemed insulting to the officer. The suspects are then released
 within 24 hours without charges having been filed.
 Exile is prohibited specifically by the Constitution and by the basic law governing
 the Turkish Cypriot community.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is legally independent of executive
 or military influence in both communities.
 On both sides, most criminal and civil cases begin in district courts, from which
 appeals are made to supreme courts.
 Cyprus inherited many elements of its legal system from the United Kingdom
 legal tradition, including the presumption of innocence, the right to due process, and
 the right of appeal. Throughout Cyprus, a fair public trial is provided for in law and
 accorded in practice. Defendants have the right to be present at their trials, to be
 represented by counsel (at government expense for those who cannot afford one), to
 confront witnesses, and to present evidence in their own defense. There are no spe-
 cial courts to try security or political offenses.
 On the Turkish Cypriot side, civilians deemed to have violated military zones are
 subject to trial in a military court. These courts consist of one military and two civil-
 ian judges and a civilian prosecutor. Members of the Turkish Cypriot bar have com-
 plained that civilian judges tend to defer to their military colleague in such hear-
 ings.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Both
 the Cyprus Constitution and the basic law governing the Turkish Cypriot commu-
 nity include provisions protecting the individual against arbitrary interference by
 the authorities, and a judicial warrant is required for a police official to enter a pri-
 vate residence. Although authorities on both sides generally respected these provi-
 sions in practice, police on both sides subjected members of the other community
 resident in their area to harassment and surveillance (see Section 5).
 The Turkish Cypriot authorities restricted the ability of Greek Cypriots and
 Maronites living in the north to change their housing at will (see Section 5).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and the press are provided
 for by law and are freely practiced throughout the island. The proliferation of party
 and independent newspapers and periodicals in both communities enables ideas and
 arguments to circulate freely. Opposition papers frequently criticize the authorities.
 Several private television and radio stations in the Greek Cypriot community com-
 pete effectively with the government-controlled stations. Following passage of new
 legislation in 1997, Turkish Cypriot authorities no longer have a monopoly on local
 radio and television. Six new, private radio stations are operating, in addition to two
 smaller, university-run stations, and three private television stations are broadcast-
 ing, with a fourth planned. International broadcasts are available without inter-
 ference throughout the island, including telecasts from Turkey and Greece.
 
 
 1220
 During the year Turkish Cypriot officials filed a number of court actions against
 newspapers and journalists, alleging that certain articles "damaged the prestige of
 the state." A number of cases were dropped before coming to trial, in response to
 retractions. No cases had come to trial by year's end.
 There have been intermittent restrictions on the ability of some journalists to
 cross the buffer zone to cover news events. The Cypriot Government has denied
 entry to the south for Turkish journalists who arrived on Cyprus through ports of
 entry in the north; in retaliation, Turkish Cypriot authorities sometimes have re-
 quired Greek Cypriot journalists to purchase a visa to enter the north, -which the
 journalists have refused to do. The current Turkish Cypriot policy is to permit
 Greek Cypriot journalists travelling as a group to cover events in the north without
 paying for visas, but not to allow Greek journalists unless they purchase visas. Indi-
 vidual Greek Cypriot journalists usually also must pay the visa fees.
 Academic freedom generally is respected throughout the island.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The freedom to hold meetings,
 associate, and organize is protected by law, and the Government respects these
 rights in practice.                                 I I
 Although Turkish authorities also generally respected these rights, they imposed
 restrictions on bicommunal meetings (see Section 2.d.).
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion generally is respected. Although mis-
 sionaries have the legal right to proselytize in both communities, missionary activi-
 ties are monitored closely by the Greek Cypriot Orthodox Church and by both Greek
 Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot authorities.
 Turkish Cypriots residing in the southern part of the island and non-Muslims in
 the north are allowed to practice their religions. Restrictions on the right of Greek
 Cypriots resident in the north to visit Apostolos Andreas monastery have been
 eased. Greek Cypriots living in the north, in groups of 20 or more, now may visit
 the monastery every Sunday and on religious holidays. An application to replace a
 retiring priest has been pending for more than 18 months.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots enjoy freedom of movement with-
 in their respective areas. Both authorities respect the right to travel abroad and to
 emigrate. Turkish Cypriots have difficulty traveling to most countries because travel
 documents issued by the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" are recognized only
 by Turkey. Most Turkish Cypriots use Turkish travel documents instead.
 The Republic of Cyprus authorities permit only day travel by tourists to the
 northern part of the island. They have declared that it is illegal to enter Cyprus
 except at authorized entry points in the south, effectively barring entry into the gov-
 ernment-controlled area by foreigners who have entered Cyprus from the north. Fol-
 lowing the 1994 murder of the director of a Greek Cypriot association supporting
 Kurds in Turkey, the Greek Cypriot authorities placed significantly tighter controls
 on the movement of Turkish Cypriots to the south. Institutions and individuals
 sponsoring visits of Turkish Cypriots to the government-controlled areas must notify
 the police in advance and provide them with an exact itinerary.
 Turkish Cypriot authorities generally allow visits to the north by persons who ini-
 tially enter Cyprus in the south, but they have denied entry to persons of Turkish-
 Cypriot origin who enter Cyprus in the south. Previously, visitors of Greek Cypriot
 or Armenian origin, or even persons having Greek or Armenian names, faced consid-
 erable difficulties entering the north. In 1995 the Turkish Cypriot authorities insti-
 tuted a new policy under which foreign nationals of Greek Cypriot origin would be
 permitted to visit the Turkish Cypriot-controlled areas. However, implementation of
 the procedures remains inconsistent.
 In February the Turkish Cypriot leadership instituted a new system of crossing
 fees at the main Nicosia checkpoint. In addition to requiring substantially higher
 crossing fees (approximately $25 (E15) for Greeks and Greek Cypriots, $6.50 (�4) for
 other nationalities, and $6.50 (f4) for Turkish Cypriots travelling to the south), the
 new plan requires Greeks and Greek Cypriots to obtain a formal "TRNC" visa to
 visit the north. Greek Cypriots, Maronites, and other non-Turkish Cypriots perma-
 nently residing in the north can obtain a monthly crossing permit for approximately
 $16 (E10). The effect of the new system has been to reduce overall crossings, espe-
 cially for Maronites visiting from the south, for whom travel previously was free.
 Following an agreement in 1997 on reciprocal visits to religious sites, a number
 of visits occurred, although there were no visits to the north in 1998 until Septem-
 ber because the Turkish Cypriot authorities were requiring Greek Cypriot visitors
 to pay the new crossing fee. The Cypriot Government permitted almost 1,300 Turk-
 ish Cypriots to make a pilgrimage to a Moslem shrine in the south in February, plus
 another 1,300 in April, the largest number since 1974. However, a scheduled Easter
 visit by Greek Cypriots to an Orthodox monastery in the north was cancelled be-
 
 
 1221
 cause of the fee requirement. In September a group of approximately 1,300 Greek
 Cypriots finally was allowed to visit the monastery without paying the crossing fee.
 In November another group of 1,400 Greek Cypriots visited the monastery as well,
 without paying the fee.
 In 1996 the European Court of Human Rights ruled 11 to 6 that Turkey commit-
 ted a continuing violation of the rights of a Greek Cypriot woman by preventing her
 from going to her property located in north Cyprus. The ruling reaffirmed the valid-
 ity of property deeds issued prior to 1974. The Court also found in this case that
 "it was obvious from the large number of troops engaged in active duties in northern
 Cyprus that the Turkish army exercised effective overall control there. In the cir-
 cumstances of the case, this entailed Turkey's responsibility for the policies and ac-
 tions of the 'TRNC."' In July the Court ordered Turkey to pay the woman approxi-
 mately $915,000 in damages and costs by October 28. The Turkish Government
 stated that it cannot implement the Coures decision, which it contends is a political
 decision, and argued that the land in question is not Turkish but is part of the
 "TIurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus."
 Until late December 1997, Turkish Cypriot authorities approved most applications
 for Turkish Cypriots to participate in bicommunal meetings in the U.N.-controlled
 buffer zone, but on December 27, 1997, they suspended Turkish Cypriot participa-
 tion in these meetings pending a reevaluation of bicommunal activities. The "sus-
 pension" soon became an effective Turkish Cyriot ban on bicommunal contacts on
 Cyprus. Whereas in 1997 thousands of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots partici-
 pated in bicommunal events, in which groups of Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cyp-
 riots met to discuss such topics as the environment, family violence, management
 techniques, business operations, and legal questions, the Turkish Cypriot ban halted
 almost all of those contacts. In addition to the ending of bicommunal events in the
 buffer zone, Turkish Cypriots may not visit the south for bicommunal contacts and
 Greek Cypriots may not visit the north for such contacts (unless they purchase a
 Turkish Cypriot "visa"). Turkish Cypriot authorities also attempted to interfere with
 some bicommunal events taking place outside Cyrus by prohibiting civil servants
 from participating. Enforcement of the policy has been inconsistent, with some pub-
 lic officials permitted to attend off-island bicommunal events. Private citizens have
 been allowed to travel to off-island bicommunal events.
 Restrictions on Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the north were eased in
 1998. Turkish Cypriot authorities usually grant the applications of Greek Cypriot
 residents in the north to visit the government-controlled area. The limit on visits
 to the south was extended this year from 15 days per month to a total of 6 months.
 The applicants must return within the designated period or risk losing their right
 to return and to keep their property, although this rule rarely is enforced in prac-
 tice. Turkish Cypriot authorities also eliminated the previous monthly limit on visits
 by close family relatives of Greek Cypriots resident in the north (it was once per
 month until 1996 and twice per month thereafter). A limit on overnight stays also
 was dropped. Persons travelling both ways must pay the new crossing fee.
 Similar restrictions exist for visits by Maronite residents of the north to the gov-
 ernment-controlled area, but they are applied much more loosely than restrictions
 on Greek Cypriots, and Maronite travel is relatively free. However, Maronite resi-
 dents also now must pay the crossing fees described above.
 While in the past Turkish Cypriot authorities permitted school holiday and week-
 end visits to the north only by children under the ages of 16 (male) and 18 (female),
 the age limits for Maronite students and female Greek Cypriot students were lifted
 entirely in 1998. Male Greek Cypriot students still may visit the north only until
 age 16, since they are eligible for Greek Cypriot military service at age 17. Students
 ay a lower fee to cross the buffer zone, approximately $3.00. During the 1997-98
 Christmas and New Year holiday, 700 adult children and grandchildren of Greek
 Cypriots living in the north visited the north and stayed overnight. During the
 1998-99 holiday, approximately 315 Greek Cypriots visited the north, but others
 cancelled visits due to the imposition of crossing fees by the Turkish Cypriots.
 According to new regulations announced in October, the Turkish Cypriot authori-
 ties no longer require Greek Cypriots or Maronites resident in the north to obtain
 police permits for internal travel in the north. They may use private vehicles reg-
 istered and insured in the north. However, it was unclear at year's end whether the
 new policy was being implemented consistently.
 Although asylum legislation remains pending in the legislature, the Government
 of Cyprus regularly grants de facto first asylum. However, during the year there
 were several instances in which large groups of illegal immigrants attempting to
 reach Western Europe instead landed on Cyprus after their overcrowded vessels en-
 countered problems at sea. The largest such group numbered over 100 persons, all
 of whom applied for political asylum after arriving in June. After several months
 
 
 1222
 
 of detention in a hotel, during which representatives of the U.N. High Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHCR) interviewed the immigrants, only 23 were granted asylum,
 and a large group was transferred to a jail. Those who did not receive asylum were
 deported against their will or awaited deportation at year's end. In August some of
 the immigrants charged that the police beat them-which the police denied. How-
 ever, in October a special police unit was filmed by local television cameras kicking
 and beating the detainees with batons, while stopping a protest during which the
 detainees burned their bedding. An examination of the immigrants, mostly black Af-
 ricans, by a forensic pathologist revealed that most were injured, some seriously.
 The Attorney General ordered investigations into both incidents, but no reports
 were released by year's end.
 The Government of Cyprus normally receives 60 to 70 asylum applications each
 year. These cases are referred to the local UNHCR- office- for evaluation. If appli-
 cants are found to meet the criteria for refugee status, they are permitted to remain
 and are given temporary, work permits. However, applicants generally are not grant-
 ed permanent resettlement rights: the Government claims that it already has
 enough responsibilities in caring for those displaced after the 1974 Turkish inter-
 vention. Applicants are permitted to remain until resettlement in a third country
 can be arranged. In both the north-and the south, cooperation with U.N. refugee
 authorities is excellent. The UNHCR is not aware of any cases of asylum seekers
 in the north in recent years.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Multiparty political systems exist throughout Cyprus. Under the Republic's Con-
 stitution, political parties compete for popular support actively and without restric-
 tion. Suffrage is universal, and elections are held by secret ballot. Elections for the
 office of president are held every 5 years; in "February President Clerides won reelec-
 tion to a new 5-year term. Elections for members of the House of Representatives
 are held every 5 years or less. In addition to their normal voting rights, the small
 Maronite, Armenian, and Latin communities also elect special nonvoting representa-
 tives from their respective communities.
 The Turkish Cypriots living in northern Cyprus elect a leader and a representa-
 tive body every 5 years or less; in December they chose a new "National Assembly."
 In April 1995 Turkish Cypriot voters elected Rauf De nktash as their leader in elec-
 tions deemed by observers to be free and fair.
 Under the 1960 Constitution, voting took place on a communal basis. Therefore,
 since the breakdown in 1963 of bicommunal governing arrangements, and since the
 1974 de facto partition of the island, Turkish Cypriots living in the government-con-
 trolled area are barred from voting there, although they may travel to the north to
 vote in elections. Simlarly, Greek Cypriots  and Maronites iving in the north are
 barred by law from participating in Turkish Cypriot elections. They are eligible to
 vote in Greek Cypriot elections but must travel to the south to exercise that right.
 They also may choose-their own village officials, but those elected are not recognized
 by the-Government of Cyprus.
 In both communities, women face no legal obstacles to-their prticiaption in the
 political process. Vhile clearly-underrepresented in government, they hold some cab-
 inet-level, judicial, and other senior positions. In the House of Representatives,
 women hold 3 of 56 seats; in the -newly elected "National Assembly" in the north,
 women hold 4 of 50 seats.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 . vestigation of Alleged'Violations of.Human Rights
 Organizations in both parts of the island consider themselves human rights
 groups; however, they generally are-concernedwith alleged violations of the rights
 of their community's members by the other community. Groups with a broad human
 rights mission include organizations promoting awareness of domestic violence and
 others concerned with alleged, police brutality.
 - No restrictions prevent the formation of human rights groups. Representatives of
 international human-rights.organizations have access throughout the island.
 The United Nations, through the autonomous Tripartite (United Nations, Greek
 Cypriot, Turkish Cypriot) Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus (CMP), is at-
 tempting to resolve the missing.persons dilemma that remained from the intercom-
 munal-violence.begining in 1963-64 and the 1974 Turkish military intervention.
 However, the CMP has made little progress. .In.July 1997, the leaders of the Greek
 and Turkish Cypriot communities agreed to collect and share information on miss-
 ing persons by the end ofSeptember 1997, outside of the CMP process. The informa-
 tion finally was exchanged in January 1998. Further progress has been delayed due
 
 
 1223
 to Turkish Cypriot reluctance to proceed without a full accounting first of who may
 have been killed in internal Greek Cypriot fighting in July 1974 prior to the landing
 of Turkish forces on Cyprus. The Government of Cyprus is exploring the possibility
 of beginning exhumations of gravesites in the south that may contain the remains
 of persons missing since 1974. In March the remains of one of the five U.S. citizens
 missing since 1974, Andrew Kassapis, was identified through DNA testing.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Legislation in both communities provides for protection against discrimination
 based on sex, religion, or national, racial or ethnic origin. While each community
 generally respects such laws, significant problems remain with the treatment of the
 reek Cypriots and Maronites living in the north and, to a lesser extent, with the
 treatment of Turkish Cypriots living in the government-controlled area.
 Women.-Spousal abuse in the Greek Cypriot community is receiving increasing
 attention, and the problem is believed to be significant. A 1994 law aimed at making
 spousal abuse easier to report and prosecute has had little effect because key provi-
 sions remain unfunded and unimplemented. Many suspected cases of domestic vio-
 lence do not reach the courts, largely because of family pressure and the wife's eco-
 nomic dependence on her husband. An organization formed to address the domestic
 abuse problem reported 689 cases through November 1998, compared with 922 cases
 in 1997, with 86 percent of the reported victims women, 11 percent children, and
 3 percent men. A shelter for battered women opened in late 1998. Very few cases
 tried in the courts result in convictions. There is little public discussion of domestic
 violence in the Turkish Cypriot community, although a report issued by the Wom-
 en's Research Center described such violence as common. A women's shelter opened
 in 1994. Domestic violence cases are rare in the Turkish Cypriot legal system, since
 they often are considered a "family matter."
 Republic of Cyprus law forbids forced prostitution. However, credible reports con-
 tinue that women, generally East Asian or Eastern European night club performers,
 are forced into prostitution in the Greek Cypriot community. To date there have
 been few arrests since the women, fearing retaliation by their employers, generally
 do not press charges. In the Turkish Cypriot community, there are an estimated 300
 to 350 women, mostly from Eastern Europe, working as prostitutes. These women
 often must surrender their passports to the club owners and sometimes are prohib-
 ited even from making private phone calls.
 Reports on the mistreatment of maids are frequent in the Greek Cypriot press.
 These reports usually involve allegations that maids, often from East or South Asia,
 have been treated inhumanely by their employers or fired without cause in violation
 of their contracts. Many women do not complain to authorities, fearing retribution
 from their employers. Those who do file charges run the risk of being fired and then
 deported.
 Throughout Cyprus, women generally have the same legal status as men. In a sig-
 nificant step, Greek Cypriot women married to foreign husbands were for the first
 time given the right to transmit citizenship to their children automatically in new
 legislation passed in December. Previously they were required to apply for Cypriot
 citizenship for their children, while Greek Cypriot men could transmit citizenship
 to their children automatically.
 In July a new Turkish Cypriot law on marriage and divorce went into effect,
 which provided for more equal treatment of husbands and wives. Under the new
 law, the man no longer is considered legally the head of the family and does not
 have the exclusive right to decide the family's place of residence. The wife may re-
 tain her surname but also must add the husband's surname. Turkish Cypriot
 women may now marry non-Moslem men. In cases of divorce, the court decides on
 a fair distribution of the family's assets, with each partner assured a minimum of
 30 percent of the assets. In dividing assets, the judge must take into account which
 partner is receiving custody of the children and provide sufficient means to support
 them. Legal provisions in both communities requiring equal pay for men and women
 performing the same job are enforced effectively at the white collar level, but Turk-
 ish Cypriot women employed in the agricultural and textile sectors routinely are
 paid less than their male counterparts.
 Children.-Both the Government and the Turkish Cypriot authorities dem-
 onstrate a strong commitment to children's welfare. There is no difference in the
 health care and educational opportunities available to boys and girls. Free education
 through age 15 is compulsory in both communities. There is no societal pattern of
 abuse of children.
 People With Disabilities.-In Cyprus generally, disabled persons do not appear to
 be discriminated against in education or the provision of state services. In the Greek
 
 
 1224
 
 Cypriot community, disabled persons who apply for a public sector position are enti-
 tled to preference if they are deemed able to perform the required duties and their
 qualifications equal those of other applicants. Legislation also mandates that new
 public building and tourist facilities provide access for the disabled, although little
 has been done to enforce this 4aw. In the Turkish Cypriot community, regulations
 require businesses to employ 1 disabled person for every 25 positions they fill, al-
 though enforcement is inconsistent. While there is increasing awareness of the
 issue, the Turkish Cypriot community has not yet enacted legislation to mandate
 access for the disabled to public buildings and other facilities.
 Religious Minorities.-Greek Cypriots living in the north report that unused Or-
 thodox churches continue to be vandalized.
 NationallRaciallEthnic Minorities.-Both the Government of Cyprus and the
 Turkish Cypriot administration have constitutional or legal bars against discrimina-
 tion. The basic agreement covering treatment of Greek Cypriots and Maronites liv-
 ing in the north and Turkish Cypriots living in the south remains the 1975 Vienna
 III Agreement. This agreement provides for voluntary transfer of populations, free
 and unhindered access by UNFICYP to Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the
 north and Turkish Cypriots living in the south, and facilities for education, medical
 care, and religious worship.
 Some Turkish Cypriots living in the government-controlled area face difficulties
 in obtaining identification cards and other government documents, especially if they
 were born after 1974. Turkish Cypriots also appear to be subjected to harassment
 and surveillance by the Greek Cypriot police. A number of Turkish Cypriots who
 worked in the government-controlled area but did not live there lost their jobs fol-
 lowing the August 1996 killing of two Greek Cypriots in the buffer zone. The Cyprus
 Government, which stated that it could not ensure the safety of the Turkish Cypriot
 workers, provided 6 months of unemployment benefits to those living in the mixed
 Greek Cypriot-Turkish Cypriot village of Pyla, but no, one has been rehired.
 UNFICYP access to Greek Cypriots -and Maronites living in the north remains
 limited. Despite recent improvements in living conditions for Greek Cypriots and
 Maronites, there still are no Greek-language educational facilities for Greek Cypriot
 or Maronite children in the north beyond the elementary level, forcing parents in
 many instances to choose between keeping their children with them or sending
 them to the south for further education (in which case they may no longer return
 permanently to the north). Additional telephones have been installed for Greek Cyp-
 riots living in the north. Greek Cypriots still complain of vandalism of unused Or-
 thodox churches, and both Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the north are un-
 able to change their housing at will. Maronites also still lack some public services
 available in most other Turkish Cypriot areas.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers, except for members of the police and
 military forces, have the legal right to form and join trade unions of their own
 choosing without prior authorization. In the government-controlled area, police offi-
 cers also have the right to join -associations, which have the right to bargain collec-
 tively, although not to strike. More than 70 percent of the Greek Cypriot work force
 belongs to independent trade unions. Approximately 50 to 60 percent of Turkish
 Cypriot private sector workers and all public sector workers belong to labor unions.
 In the Turkish Cypriot community, union officials allege that various firms were
 successful in establishing "company' organizations and then applying pressure on
 workers to join these-unions: Officials of independent labor unions also have accused
 the Turkish Cypriot authorities of creating rival public sector unions to weaken the
 independent unions. The International Labor Organization (ILO) has not yet acted
 on these complaints.
 In both communities, trade unions freely and regularly take stands on public pol-
 icy issues that affected workers and maintain their independence from the authori-
 ties. Two of the major trade unions, one in each community, are affiliated closely
 with political parties. Both of the other major unions are independent.
 All workers have the right to strike, and several strikes have occurred. However,
 in the northern part of the island a 1978 court ruling gives employers an unre
 stricted right to hire replacement workers in the event of a strike, thereby limiting
 the effectiveness of the right to strike. Authorities of both the Greek Cypriot and
 Turkish Cypriot communities have the power to curtail strikes in what they deem
 to be "essential services," although this right is used rarely.
 Unions in both parts of Cyprus are able to affiliate with international trade union
 organizations, although Greek Cypriot unions sometimes object to recognition of
 Turkish Cypriot unions formed after 1963.

 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Trade unions and confed-
 erations by law are free to organize and bargain collectively throughout Cyprus.
 This right is observed in practice in the government-controlled areas, and most
 wages and benefits are set by freely negotiated collective agreements. However,
 Greek Cypriot collective bargaining agreements are not enforceable. In the rare in-
 stances when such agreements are believed to have been infringed, the Ministry of
 Labor is called in to investigate the claim. If the Ministry is unable to resolve the
 dispute, the union may call a strike to support its demands. However, in practice
 such alleged violations are extremely rare.
 In the Turkish Cypriot community, where inflation exceeded 60 percent over the
 year, wage levels are reviewed several times a year for both the private sector and
 public sector workers, and a corresponding cost-of-living raise is established. A spe-
 cial commission composed of five representatives each from organized labor, employ-
 ers, and the authorities conducts the review. Union leaders contend that private sec-
 tor employers are able to discourage union activity because the enforcement of labor
 and occupational safety regulations is sporadic, and penalties for antiunion practices
 are minimal. As in the Greek Cypriot community, parties to a dispute may request
 mediation by the authorities.
 Small export processing zones exist in the port of Larnaca and in Famagusta, but
 the laws governing working conditions and actual practice there are the same as
 those outside the zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor, in-
 cluding that performed by children, is prohibited by law, and this prohibition is gen-
 erally observed. However, there were credible reports that foreign women were
 forced into prostitution (see Section 5).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-In both
 the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities, the minimum age for the em-
 ployment of children in an "industrial undertaking" is 16 years of age. Turkish Cyp-
 riots may be employed in apprentice positions at the age of 15. There are labor in-
 spectors in both communities. However, in family-run shops it is common to see
 younger children working after school, and according to press reports, children as
 young as 11 or 12 years of age work in factories or orchards during their school holi-
 days in the Turkish Cypriot community. Laws prohibit forced and bonded child
 labor, and these laws are enforced effectively in both communities (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legislated minimum wage in the Greek
 Cypriot community, which is reviewed every year, is approximately $496 (�C 248)
 per month for shop assistants, practical nurses, clerks, hairdressers, and nursery as-
 sistants. This amount is insufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a
 worker and family. All other occupations are covered under collective bargaining
 agreements between trade unions and employers within the same economic sector,
 and the wages set in these agreements are significantly higher than the legislated
 minimum wage. The legislated minimum wage in the Turkish Cypriot area, while
 subject to frequent review because of high inflation, was approximately $265 (EC
 132.5) per month as of January 1999. This amount is insufficient to provide a decent
 standard of living for a worker and family. Unskilled workers typically earn about
 $330 (EC 165) per month, which is barely adequate to support a family.
 In the Greek Cypriot community, the standard workweek in the private sector is
 an average of 39 hours for white-collar workers and 38 hours for blue-collar work-
 ers. In the public sector, it is 37Y hours during the winter and 35 hours in the sum-
 mer. In the Turkish Cypriot community, the standard workweek is 38 hours in the
 winter and 36 hours in the summer. Labor inspectors effectively enforce these laws.
 A significant percentage of the labor force in the north consists of illegal workers,
 mostly from Turkey. According to some estimates, illegal workers constitute as
 much as 25 percent of the total work force there. There are frequent allegations that
 such workers are subject to mistreatment, including nonpayment of wages and
 threats of deportation.
 Recent steps were taken to improve health and safety standards in the workplace
 in the government-controlled area. In 1997 a law took effect that harmonized health
 and safety standards with those in the European Union (EU). The new law incor-
 porates EU principles and standards for health and safety in the workplace and
 complies fully with the 1981 ILO Convention on occupational health and safety. A
 second law entered into effect in November 1997, requiring employers to provide in-
 surance liability coverage for work-related injuries.
 Occupational safety and health regulations are administered sporadically at best
 in the Turkish Cypriot area. In both areas, factory inspectors process complaints
 and inspect business in order to ensure that occupational safety laws are observed.
 Workers in the government-controlled area can remove themselves from dangerous

 work conditions without risking loss of employment. -Turkish Cypriot workers who
 file complaints do not receive satisfactory legal protection and may face dismissal.
