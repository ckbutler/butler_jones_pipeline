 BOTSWANA
 Botswana is a long-standing, multiparty democracy. Constitutional power is
 shared between the President, Sir Ketumile Masire, and the 44-member, popularly
 elected lower house of Parliament. The ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP)
 continued to dominate the National Assembly, holding 31 of 44 seats. The opposition
 Botswana National Front (BNF) holds the remaining 13 seats. In October 1994, the
 President was reelected in free and fair elections for a third 5-year term. The Gov-
 ernment respects the constitutional provisions for an independent judiciary.
 The civilian Government exercises effective control over the security forces. The
 military, the Botswana Defense Force (BDF), is responsible for external security.
 The Botswana National Police (BNP) are responsible for internal security. Members
 of the security forces occasionally committed human rights abuses.
 The economy is market oriented with strong encouragement for private enter-
 prise. Healthy diamond revenues and effective economic and fiscal policies resulted
 in improved growth, with the economy growing at a robust annual rate of approxi-
 mately 7 percent following a downturn from 1991 to 1993. Per capita gross domestic
 product was approximately $2,800 in 1997. Over 50 percent of the population is em-
 ployed in the informal sector, largely subsistence farming and animal husbandry.
 Rural poverty remains a serious problem, as does a widely skewed income distribu-
 tion.
 The Constitution provides for citizens' human rights, and the Government gen-
 erally respects those rights in practice, although there were some continuing prob-
 lems. There were credible reports that the police sometimes mistreated criminal sus-
 pects in order to obtain evidence or coerce confessions. The authorities have taken
 action in some cases against persons responsible for abuses. In many instances the
 judicial system did not provide timely fair trials due to a serious backlog of cases.
 Women continued to face legal and societal discrimination, and violence against
 women is a continuing problem. The Government met with nongovernmental organi-
 zations (NGO's) to formulate a long-term plan of action to implement its national
 policy on women, which is designed to address these problems. Some Batswana, in-
 cluding groups not numbered among the eight "principal tribes" identified in the
 Constitution because they live in remote areas, still do not enjoy full access to social
 services and, in practice, are marginalized in the political process. Trade unions con-
 tinued to face some legal restrictions, and the Government did not always ensure
 that labor laws were observed in practice.
 The Government continued to address human rights problems. There were in-
 stances of abuse by police, including intimidation of suspects to obtain evidence or
 elicit confessions.
 Parliament ratified nine international labor conventions and adopted national
 policies on children and on care of the disabled. However, the Government's 1995
 plan to construct a separate detention facility for asylum seekers whose refugee
 claims have been rejected continued to be delayed pending resolution of a dispute
 between two government ministries over development of the property. The facility
 is referred to by the Government as the Center for Illegal Immigrants. Until the
 Center is completed, refused asylum seekers continue to be detained in prison. Refu-
 gees and asylum seekers refused under Botswana's "first country of asylum" policy
 are housed at Dukwe Refugee Camp.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 Police continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding the 1996 suffocation
 death of~a burglary suspect in which six members of the BDF military Intelligence
 unit wereimplcated. Due to insufficient evidence, no charges have as yet been filed.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution explicitly forbids torture, inhuman, and degrading treatment or
 punishment. The authorities generally respect this  prohibition in practice and, in
 some cases, have taken disciplinary or judicial action against persons responsible for
 abuses. However, instances of abuse do occur. Whle coerced confessions are inad-
 missible in court, evidence gathered through coercion or abuse may be used in pros-
 ecution. There were credible reports that police sometimes used intimidation tech-
 niques in order to obtain evidence or elicit confessions. In the past police sometimes
 suffocated criminal suspects with a plastic bag. In general, however, beatings and
 other forms of extreme physical abuse remained rare.
 Student riots in February 1995 over police handling of a ritual murder case re-
 sulted in some injuries. The Attorney-General's office pursued chargssagainst some
 ofthe rioters, charging them-with unlawful rioting and assault. However, they were
 acquitted in 1997.
 ,Customary courts continued to impose corporeal punishment sentences in the
 form of lashings oir he buttocks. There were periodic-press. reports of floggings, par-
 ticularly of young offenders in villages,imposed by customary courts for vandalism,
 theft, hooligaism, an. bther infractions. The Government has refused to adopt a
 motion submitted by the House of Chiefs to reinstate flogging across the back rather
 * thansthe buttocks. The House of Chiefs is an advisory body only.
 mPrison conditions meet minimum international standards, although overcrowding
 is a problem. Women in custody are placed in the charge of female officers. The Gov-
 ernment permits visits by human rights monitors after a detailed inquiry procedure.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest,.Detention, or-Exie.-Under the Constitution "every person in
 Botswana" is.entitled to due process, the presumption of innocene, and freedom
 frtoarbitrsycarrrest. The authorities urespected these guarantees in practice. Sus-
 Cpets must be informed of their legal rights upon arrest, including the right to re-
 main silent, to be allowed to .ontact a person of their choice, and generally to be
 charged before a magistrate within 48 hours. A magistrate may order a suspect held
 for 14 days tbrough a writ of detention, which may be renewed every 14 days. Most
 citizens charged with noncapital offenses are released on  their own recognizance;
 some are released with minimal bail. Detention without bail is highly unusual, ex-
 cept in murder cases, where it is mandated.
 Detainees have the right to hire attorneys of their choice.
 Poor police training and poor communications in rural villages make it difficult
 for detainees to obtain legal assistance, however, and authorities do not always fol-
 low judicial safeguards. The Government does not provide counsel for the indigent,
 except in capital cases. Two nongovernmental organizations (NGO's)-the Univer-
 sity of Botswana Legal Assistance Center and the Botswana Center for Human
 Rights-provide free legal services, but their capacity is limited. Constitutional pro-
 tections are not applied to illegal immigrants, although the constitutionality of deny-
 ing them due proes s   not been tested in court.
 The Government neither forcibly repatriates nor deports failed asylum seekers,
 but it detains and incarcerates them alongside convicted felons (see Section 2.d.).
 The Government does not use exile for political purposes.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 r       dthe Government respects this prvision in practice.
 ejudici      consists of beth a civil court (including magistrates' courts, a High
 Court, and a      of ppeal) and a customary (traditional) court system. The law
 provides for the right to a fair trial. The civil courts remained unable to provide for
 timely, fair trials in many cases, however, due to severe staffing shortages and a
 backlog of pending cases. The courts are making a major effort to clear this backlog,
 especially in murder cases.
 Most trials in the regular courts are public, although trials under the National
 Security Act (NSA) may be held in secret. Those charged with noncapital crimes are
 tried without legal representation if they cannot affor an attorney. As a result,
 many defendants may not be informed of their rights in pretrial or trial proceedings.
 Most citizens encounter the legal system through the customary courts, under the
 authority of a traditional leader. These courts handle minor offenses involving land,
 
 
 marital, and property disputes. In customary courts the defendant does not have
 legal counsel and ther are no precise rules of evidence. Tribal judges, appointed
 by the tribal leader or elected by the community, determine sentences, which may
 be appealed through the civil court system. The quality of decisions reached in the
 traditional courts varies considerably. In communities where chiefs and their deci-
 sions are respected, plaintiffs tend to take their cases to the customary court; other-
 wise, people seek justice in the civil courts.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the protection of privacy and the security of the person,
 and government authorities generally respect these rights.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and the Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of ex-
 prssion, both individual and corporate, and the Government generally respects this
 right in practice. Botswana has a long tradition of vigorous, candid, and unimpeded
 public discourse.
 The independent press is small, but lively and frequently critical of the Govern-
 ment and the President. It reports without fear of closure or censorship. Concern
 was expressed, however, over proposed legislation to regulate print and broadcast
 media that would have vested government officials with considerably expanded
 power over. the press. Local and regional media organizations also objected to the
 80 percent citizen ownership requirement contained in the proposal. Government of-
 ficials agreed to review the draft bill in consultation with media representatives be-
 fore submitting it to Parliament.
 The Government subsidizes a free daily newspaper which depends heavily on the
 official Botswana Press Agency (BOPA) for its material. The broadcast media re-
 main a government monopoly, with radio the most important medium of information
 in this highly dispersed society. Radio Botswana follows government policies and
 draws most of its stories from BOPA. Opposition leaders have access to the radio,
 but they complain-with some justification-that their air time is significantly lim-
 ited. The oniy television station is privately owned and broadcasts to viewers in the
 capital city. Independent radio and television from neighboring South Africa are
 easily received.
 On occasion the Government has taken steps, under loosely defined provisions of
 the NSA, to limit publication of national security information.
 Academic freedom is not restricted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Withi    he Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.There are no formal barriers to domestic and international travel or mi-
 gration. Some human rights organizations claimed that the Government pressured
 several Basarwa (Bushmen) communities within the central Kalahari Game Reserve
 (CKGR) into relocating to partially built new settlements outside of the Reserve.
 Government officials maintained th  the "voluntary" resettlement was necessary in
 order to provide the Basarwa with better public services-and to avoid conflicts be-
 tween wildlife and humans within the CKGR. When the Basarwa arrived at the
 new settlements, services and facilities were substandard or nonexistent. Although
 conditions later improved, they remain very basic. It is not clear whether resettled
 Basarwa would be permitted to return to their former villages inside the CKGR
 should they choose to do so.
 The Government cooperates with the UNHCR and other humanitarian organiza-
 tions in assisting refugees. Botswana has maintained a policy of considering reset-
 tlement requests only from refugees from bordering countries. The Government has,
 however, permitted failed asylum seekers to remain in the country either at the
 Dukwe Refugee Camp or in jail.
 There were no confirmed reports of forced return of persons to a country where
 they feared persecution. Refugees and asylum seekers refused under Botswana's
 "first country of asylum" policy are housed at Dukwe Refugee Camp until they are
 resettled or repatriated.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citzn it  th the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal adult (21 years o age suffrage. The Bot-
 
 
 19
 swana Democratic Party continued to dominate Parliament following the October
 1994 elections, ensuring the reelection of BDP leader Sir Ketumile Masire as Presi-
 .dent. The opposition Botswana National Front, the only opposition party to win
 seats, increased its representation from 3 to 13 seats. Following parliamentary ap-
 proval, the public voted in a referendum held in October to lower the voting age
 to 18 and permit voting by absentee ballots. Parliament also approved the constitu-
 tional clarification limiting presidential terms to two 5-year terms. A referendum
 was not required to enact this procedural provision.
 The House of Chiefs, an advisory upper chamber of Parliament with limited pow-
 ers, is constitutionally restricted to the eight-"principal tribes" of the Tswana nation.
 Consequently, other groups (e.g., The Basarwa "bushmen," Herero, Kalanga,
 Humbukush, Baloi, or Lozi) are not represented there. Given the limited authority
 of the House of Chiefs, the impact of excluding other groups of Botswana citizens
 is largely symbolic, but it is viewed as important in principle by some non-Setswana
 speakers. Members of the National Assembly are required to be able to speak Eng-
 lish. This restriction has never been challenged in court.
 In practice, women are underrepresented in the political process. Although women
 constitute-just over 50 percent of the populationthere-are only 4 women among the
 44 members of the National Assembly, and only 2 female ministers in the Cabinet.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Domestic and international human rights groups operate without government re-
 striction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Govern-
 ment officials are generally cooperative and responsive to such inquiries.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability,.Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and Penal Code forbid discrimination on the basis of ethnicity,
 nationality, or creed, but do not address discrimination based on sex. These provi-
 sions are implemented in practice by the government authorities.
 Women.-Violence against women, primarily beatings, remains a serious problem.
 Under customary law and in common rural practice men have the right to "chastise"
 their wives. Statistics are believed to underreport the levels of abuse against
 women. Police are rarely called to intervene in cases of domestic violence. The Attor-
 ney General's office attributed an increase in the number of reported domestic vio-
 lence cases, including rape, to greater public awareness and improved legal protec-
 tion for victims. Under a law adopted by Parliament in- all rape cases are tried in
 private. Two domestic violence homicide cases are awaiting trial before the High'
 Court.
 Women inBotswana do not have the-same~civil rights as men. However, the Gov-
 ernment and relevant NGO's met to formulate a long-term plan of action for imple-
 menting the National Policy on Women adopted in July 1996. The plan identifies
 six critical areas of concern, prioritized as follows: 1) women and poverty, 2) women
 and powersharing and decisionmaking, 3) education and training of women, 4)
 women and health, 5) the girl child, and 6) violence against women. The Women's
 Affairs Department of the Ministry of Labor and Home Affairs cosponsored a work-
 shop on a national gender program to promote a comprehensive and integrated ap-
 proach to implementing the. goals of the national policy on women. Booklets are
 being printed for distribution to the public. The Government is also working with
 the United Nations Development Program to develop a "marketing plan" to ensure
 that the gender program and overall policy on women are incorporated into policy-
 making and budgeting and planning decisions. The plan also aims to develop capac-
 ity within the Government and NGO's to implement the program and overall policy.
 In April female political leaders in conjunction with a local NGO launched the Bot-
 swana Caucus for Women Councillors and Parliamentarians to work for equal rep-
 resentation of men and women in local government and Parliament, both as elected
 members and as participating citizens.
 A number of other laws, many of which are attributed to traditional practices, re-
 strict civil and economic opportunities for women. A woman married in "common
 property" is held to be a legal minor, requiring her husband's consent to buy or sell
 property, apply for credit, and enter into legally binding contracts. Under a law
 adopted by Parliament, women married in "community of property" are now per-
 mitted to own immovable property in their own name; however, their husbands still
 retain considerable control over jointly-held assets of the marriage. In community
 of property, property is jointly owned by the couple, but the right to manage it is
 almost exclusively reserved to the husband. The law adopted in 1996 was a step to-
 
 
 ward equalizing a husband's and a wife's legal control over property held in commu-
 nity of property
 Women    av, and are increasingly exercising, the right to marriage "out of com-
 monproperty," in which case they retain their full legal rights as adults. Polygyny
 is still legal under traditional law and with the consent of the first wife, but it is
 rarely practiced. Consultants have been reviewing existing laws to identify provi-
 sions that may discriminate against women and plan to submit a report to the Min-
 istry of Labor and Home Affairs next year.
 Well-trained urban women enjoy growing entry level access to the white collar job
 market, but the number of opportunities decreases sharply as they rise in seniority.
 Discrimination against women is most acute in rural areas where women work pri-
 marily in subsistence agriculture.
 A number of women's organizations have emerged to promote the status of
 women. The Government has entered into a dialog with many of these groups.
 While some women's rights groups reportedly felt that the Government has been
 slow to respond concretely to their concerns, women's NGO's say that they are en-
 couraged by the direction of change and by the increasingly collaborative relation-
 ship with government authorities. Within the Ministry of  bor and Home Affairs,
 the Women's Affairs unit, which is charged with handling women's issues, was up-
 graded from a division to a department.
 Children.-The Government provides 7 years of primary education for children al-
 though it is not compulsory. The rights of children are addressed in the Constitution
 and the 1981 Children's Act. Under the act Botswana has a court system and social
 service apparatus designed solely for juveniles. There is no societal pattern of abuse
 against children, although incest and other forms of child abuse have recently re-
 ceived increased attention from the media and from local human rights groups. The
 Government launched a 10-year program of action for children in 1997, incorporat-
 ing the seven major global goals identified at the 1990 U.N. World Summit for Chil-
 dren. In addition, the Ministry of Labor and Home Affairs is reviewing laws pertain-
 ing to children to align them with the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not discriminate on the basis of
 physical or mental disability, although employment opportunities for the disabled
 remain limited. The Government does not require accessibility to public buildings
 and public conveyances for People with- disabilities, and the NGO community has
 only recently begun to address the needs of the disabled. In February Parliament
 adopted a national policy that provides for integrating the needs of disabled persons
 into all aspects of government policy-making. The Government funded NGO's pro-
 viding rehabilitation services and supported small-scale work projects by disabled
 workers.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Tswana majority, of which the Constitu-
 tion recognizes eight principal tribes, has a tradition of peacefully coexisting with
 "minor" tribes. Each of the eight principal tribes is represented in the advisory
 House of Chiefs, while the other groups are permitted only a subchief, who is not
 a member of the House. Other than the lack of schooling in their own language and
 representation in the House of Chiefs, Botswana's Bantu minorities and nonmdige-
 nous minorities, such as the white and Asian communities, are not subject to dis-
 crimination. However, the nomadic Basarwa remain marginalized; they have lost ac-
 cess to their traditional land and are vulnerable to exploitation. Their isolation, ig-
 norance of civil rights, and lack of representation in local or national government
 have stymied their progress.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of associa-
 tion. In practice all workers, with the exception of government employees, are free
 to join or organize unions of their own choosing. Government workers may form as-
 sociations that function as quasi-unions but without the right to negotiate wages.
 The industrial or wage economy is small, and unions are concentrated largely in the
 mineral and to a lesser extent in the railway and banking sectors. There is only one
 major confederation, the Botswana Federation of Trade Unions (BFTU), but there
 are no obstacles to the formation of other labor federations.
 The Government ratified nine International Labor Organization (ILO) conventions
 in 1997, including five characterized by the ILO as core human rights conventions.
 Unions are independent of the Government and are not closely allied with any
 political party or movement. Unions may employ administrative staff, but the law
 requires elected union officials to work full time in the industry the union rep-
 resents. This severely limits union leaders' professionalism and effectiveness and
 has been criticized by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 (ICFTU).
 
 
 21
 The law also severely restricts the right to strike. Legal strikes are theoretically
 -possible after an exhaustive arbitration process, but- in practice none of the countrs
 strikes to date has been legal.
 Unions may join international organizations, ana the BFTU.is affiliated with the
 ICFTU. The Minister of Labor must approve any affiliation with an outside labor
 movement, but unions may appeal to the courts if an application for affiliation is
 refused.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution provides for
 collective, bargaining for unions that have enrolled .25 percent of a labor force. In
 reality only the mineworker unions have the organizational strength to engage in
 collective bargaining
 Workers may notbe fired for union-related activities. Dismissals may be appealed
 to labor officers or civil courts, but labor offices rarely do more than order 2-months'
 severance pay.
 Botswana has only one export processing zone-in the town of Selebi-Phikwe-
 which is subject to the same -abor laws as the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The constitutional provision pro-
 hibiting-forced or bonded labor applies to all citizens, although its application to
 children is not specified. There were no reports of forced or bonded labor.
 d. Statusof Child Labor Practices and- Minimum Age for Employment of Chil-
 dren.-Although education is not compulsory, the Government provides 7 years of
 free primary education to every child, and most children take advantage of this op-
 portunity. Only an immediate family member may employ a child la-years-old or
 younger, and no juvenile under 15 years may be employed in any industry. Only
 persons over 16 years may be hirdt perform night work, and no person under
 16 years is allowed to perfom hazardous labor, including mining. District and mu-
 nicipal councils have child welfare divisions which are responsible for enforcing
 child labor laws. The constitutional provision prohibiting forced or bonded labor ap-
 plies to all citizens, although its application to children is not specified (see Section
 6.c.)  Because research on the issue of child labor is limited, it is difficult to state
 whether child labor laws are effectively enforced. Child labor is not perceived to be
 a significant problem. The high level of primary and junior school attendance, cou-
 pled with the Government's policy of increasing the number of schools so as to ac-
 commodate more pupils for a greater number of years is a good indicator of dedica-
 tion in.principle and practice to deterring child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum daily wage for full time labor
 is $3.50 (12.7 pula), which is less than 50 percent of what the Government cal-
 culates is necessary to meet the basic needs of a family of five. The Ministry of
 Labor is responsible for enforcing the minimum wage, and each of the country's dis-
 tricts has at least one labor inspector. The Ministry of Labor referred 91 trade dis-
 putes to the Industrial Court in 1997.
 Formal sector jobs almost always pay well above minimum wage levels. Informal
 sector employment, particularly in the agricultural and domestic service sectors
 where housing and food are included, frequently pay below the minimum wage. The
 Ministry of Labor recommends a monthly minimum wage of $69 (250 pula) for do-
 mestics, but this is not mandatory. Illegal immigrants, primarily Zambians and
 Zimbabweans, are easily exploited as they would be subject to deportation if they
 filed grievances against employers.
 Botswana law permits a maximum 48-hour workweek, exclusive of overtime
 which is payable at time and a half for each additional hour. Most modern priVate
 and public sector jobs are on the 40-hour workweek.
 Workers who complain about hazardous conditions cannot be fired. The Govern-
 ment's institutional ability to enforce its workplace safety legislation remains lim-
 ited, however, by inadequate staffing and unclear jurisdictions between different
 ministries. Nevertheless, worker safety is generally provided for by employers, with
 the occasionally notable exception of the construction industry.
