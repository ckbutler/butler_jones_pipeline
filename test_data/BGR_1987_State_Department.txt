 BULGARIA
 Bulgaria is a centralized Marxist-Leninist state. The
 Bulgarian Communist Party holds a monopoly of power and seeks
 to control and direct all political, economic, social, and
 cultural activities. A second party, the Bulgarian National
 Agrarian Union, is represented in the Government and National
 Assembly but is totally subservient to the Communist Party.
 No other political parties are tolerated.
 An omnipresent network of state security police and militia
 (uniformed national police) deters or suppresses open
 expressions of opposition to the regime or its policies.
 All production and commercial facilities, except for small
 private'agricultural plots and small-scale businesses that can
 be operated by an individual, a family, or a cooperative,
 without hired labor, are owned by the State. The party
 controls the trade union movement and uses it as a vehicle for
 mobilizing the work force to achieve the regime's goals.
 The Constitution specifies a number of civil, political, and
 social rights, but in practice these rights are circumscribed
 and cannot be exercised in any way that the Communist Party
 deems unacceptable. Most limitations on and denials of civil
 and political rights apply to all Bulgarians, but the
 country's Turkish minority--about one-tenth of the
 population--is subject to additional, severe restrictions.
 The use of the Turkish language and traditional forms of dress
 is banned, as are some Islamic religious practices. The
 forced change from Turkish to Bulgarian given names and
 surnames was completed in 1984-85, and emigration to Turkey
 was closed off. No more than isolated acts of active
 resistance to the Government's assimilationist policies
 occurred in 1987, and they were harshly repressed.
 The human rights situation changed little during 1987. The
 number of Bulgarians allowed to travel to the West increased
 significantly, and the Communist-dominated media reported more
 openly on selected issues. The authorities, however,
 maintained tight control over all aspects of Bulgarian life
 and gave no indication of reconsidering their repressive
 policies towards the Turkish minority.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported cases of disappearance at the hands of
 Bulgarian security forces.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 According to credible reports, torture and beatings continue
 to be a feature of imprisonment in Bulgaria. A July 1987
 Amnesty International report indicates that ethnic Turkish
 journalist Halim Hyuseinov Pasadzhov, who was arrested in 1985
 because of his opposition to the Government's name change
 
 
 861
 BULGARIA
 campaign, may have been subjected to torture, including
 "prolonged bouts of 'falange' (beatings on the soles of his
 feet)," during pretrial detention in 1985. Political
 prisoners, including intellectuals, are sometimes subject to
 brutal treatment by common criminals, with whom they share
 cells, as well as by their guards. During 1987 it was learned
 that dissident Volodya Angelov Nakov, who had been in contact
 with Western leaders, embassies, and journalists in the early
 1980's, was arrested in 1984 and murdered in his jail cell in
 September 1985 by a mentally deranged common criminal with
 whom he was quartered. Some persons apprehended while
 attempting to leave Bulgaria without authorization have
 reportedly suffered severe abuse at the hands of border
 guards.
 Dissident activity and political opposition may result in
 enforced psychiatric treatment. Grigor Simov Bozhilov, one of
 a small group of Bulgarians who signed an "appeal" to the
 meeting in Vienna of the Conference on Security and
 Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in early 1987, reportedly was
 temporarily confined in a mental institution before being sent
 into internal exile.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Bulgarian citizens may be detained, tried, and punished for
 many actions which elsewhere are considered political, not
 criminal, in nature. Police interrogation, detention, and
 even arrest may result from unauthorized demonstrations,
 public criticism of the Government, or the mere act of
 entering or approaching a Western embassy, although such
 activities are not explicitly illegal under Bulgarian law.
 Several Bulgarians during 1987 privately indicated that they
 feared to go to a Western embassy or even to communicate with
 one by telephone.
 Although the principle of a judicial determination of the
 legality of a person's detention exists in Bulgarian law, it
 does not provide effective relief against state action. The
 Bulgarian judiciary is not independent of executive power, nor
 is it able to provide any effective check on executive
 actions. Although preliminary detention is limited
 theoretically to 10 days, and then only when the evidence
 appears sufficient to justify an indictment, several cases are
 known of persons subjected to longer detention without charges
 being filed. Following arraignment, Bulgarian law permits
 detention up to 6 months before indictment. Under the
 criminal code, the accused must be informed of the charges
 against him, but sometimes this requirement is not observed.
 Persons may also be subject to a system of administrative
 control short of imprisonment, by which they are detained at
 their place of residence and must appear frequently at the
 local police station. Another form of punishment and control
 is forced change of domicile or internal exile. A person's
 right to remain in his place of residence may be revoked, and
 he may be required to move far from family and familiar
 surroundings.
 In its 1987 Report, Amnesty International noted that Hristo
 Kulishev, pastor of the First Congregational Church in Sofia,
 was sentenced to 8 months' imprisonment in 1985 for not
 yielding his parish to a government-sponsored appointee.
 Subsequently, for continuing his religious activities, he was
 banished under the People's Militia'Law to northeast Bulgaria
 
 
 862
 BULGARIA
 where he had to report twice daily to the police and could
 receive only one monthly visit from his wife. Should exiles
 or persons under such administrative controls leave despite
 these prohibitions, they face possible imprisonment.
 It is not possible to estimate reliably the number of persons
 subject to arbitrary arrests, other forms of detention, or
 summary exile in 1987. There was credible evidence in 1986
 and 1987 that Bulgarians of Turkish ancestry, who had been
 incarcerated on Belene Island or in other Bulgarian prisons
 for their resistance to the 1984-85 assimilation campaign or
 for other "troublemaking," were being resettled after release
 from prison to areas of Bulgaria with small numbers of ethnic
 Turks. The exact number of detainees who may still be
 incarcerated or in internal exile as a result of that campaign
 is unknown. However, credible reports, including those
 documented by Amnesty International and Helsinki Watch,
 indicate that many ethnic Turks are still imprisoned or
 exiled. A Bulgarian woman of Turkish ancestry reportedly was
 detained for 4 days and beaten after fending off the sexual.
 advances of an official from whom she sought an exit permit to
 rejoin her husband outside Bulgaria.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Bulgarian law and general practice provide for public trial in
 criminal cases. Defendants are entitled to legal counsel but
 only after preliminary investigations and indictment, a
 process that can last many weeks. When defense attorneys are
 provided, they often cooperate with the prosecution.
 According to a 1987 report, a Bulgarian lawyer was subjected
 to disbarnfent proceedings because of his too energetic defense
 of a client prosecuted for political reasons. Some defense
 attorneys enjoy reputations for courage and honesty, despite
 pressures from the security apparatus.
 Special court procedures apply in cases involving state
 security. Trials in such cases, and in others with political
 implications, are not public. The number of such trials is
 not known. Taking into account also those captured while
 trying to escape across the country's borders and ethnic Turks
 detained during and since the name change campaign, the number
 of political prisoners is estimated at several thousand.
 The judicial system generally seeks to maintain a semblance of
 observing legal norms, but the courts sometimes apply statutes
 retroactively or extend them to cases of dubious
 applicability. The penal laws are codified, published, and
 readily available for reference, but numerous procedural and
 administrative regulations are not. Such regulations are
 frequently invoked in judicial proceedings, and the defendant
 has little opportunity to question the validity or
 applicability of the regulation in question.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government and Communist Party interfere in the private
 lives of citizens in many ways. The party and the security
 apparatus direct an elaborate system of informers, which is
 present in virtually all workplaces, residential areas, and
 social organizations, to monitor the daily lives of Bulgarians
 for signs of dissidence or other unacceptable behavior.
 Citizens assume that security personnel may monitor their
 telephone conversations and read their mail.
 
 
 863
 BULGARIA
 The sanctity of the home is nominally safeguarded by law, and
 police may not legally search property without prior
 permission from a court or prosecutor. However, searches may
 be undertaken in urgent situations before judicial permission
 is given. The authorities are required to issue an itemized
 receipt for property confiscated during a search. In one
 case, a defendant facing trial refused to sign this document,
 charging'that it contained falsehoods. In court, the
 defendant reported that his signature was forged on the
 document, but a judge admitted it as evidence over the defense
 lawyer's protest.
 The Government regiments the private lives of citizens.
 Virtually all citizens are members of mass organizations.
 Children and young adults belong to the Pioneers and Komsomol,
 respectively, while their elders belong to the Fatherland
 Front and, in the case of the elite, the Bulgarian Communist
 Party. There are strong pressures on all citizens to become
 members of and pay dues to the mass organizations. Those who
 refuse--an extremely small percentage of the population--are
 likely to come under official scrutiny and to be denied
 advancement at work and other benefits.
 Government policies toward the Turkish minority, which it
 describes as "Bulgarians who were forcibly Islamicized under
 Ottoman rule," demonstrate forceful interference into areas
 traditionally regarded as private. Despite official denials,
 the public use of the Turkish language is banned. The wearing
 of traditional forms of dress is also forbidden. The ethnic
 Turkish and Muslim population continues to be required to use
 Bulgarian names forced on it in the 1984-85 name change
 campaign. Education in the Turkish language has long been
 banned.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for certain basic rights, including
 freedom of speech and press. In practice,'however, other laws
 provide severe punishment for anyone convicted of criticizing
 the State or spreading "untruthful remarks which might
 increase distrust of state power cr cause confusion in
 society." Unauthorized disclosure of information, such as
 unpublished economic statistics, is illegal and subject to
 serious penalties.
 The regime totally controls Bulgaria's press, radio, and
 television. Although censorship officially does not exist,
 the media, as well as writers, artists, and those in academic
 life, operate within well-understood party and government
 guidelines and practices. International news coverage is
 usually limited to that provided by the government news agency
 or official Soviet sources, although carefully selected
 articles from the Western press are sometimes published in
 translation. Forbidden topics in the Bulgarian press include
 unauthorized criticism of party and state leaders, of
 Communist ideology, and of other Communist countries,
 particularly the U.S.S.R.
 Some positive developments were visible in the media in 1987.
 The range of tolerated opinion on some issues, although still
 narrow, was somewhat broadened, and franker factual reporting
 on some social problems was permitted. Some Western
 newspapers were seen occasionally on certain Sofia
 
 
 864
 BULGARIA
 newsstands. However, progress in this area, while
 significant, has been very limited and has appeared to be the
 subject of competing pressures within the leadership. Radio
 Free Europe's Bulgarian Service continues to be jammed,
 particularly in the capital area, but other Western broadcasts
 are not jammed.
 In addition to pervasive party control of the media, virtually
 the entire population practices self-censorship. Annual
 6ongresses of the official Writers Union adopt acceptable
 themes for authors, and those not following directives are
 unlikely to see their work published. Academic journals may
 not challenge regime policies.
 Ordinary citizens send criticism, suggestions, and complaints
 by letter to newspapers and to National Assembly deputies on a
 broad range of topics, such as inadequate services by public
 agencies and housing shortages. None of the letters
 published, however, exceeds criticism of specific shortcomings
 or failures of lower-level administrative officials, in
 conformity with state policy on "criticism."
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is a right granted only to legally
 constituted organizations, and only for approved purposes.
 Attendance at public demonstrations is a duty assigned by
 schools and enterprises to their members. The number of
 mandatory public demonstrations was reduced by a Politburo
 decision in the summer of 1987.
 The Constitution provides for'freedom of association and
 demonstration, but in practice the party decides which social
 and political organizations may exist. Private associations
 are unknown, and the law provides punishment for anyone
 "founding an illegal, antistate organization."  Lawyers,
 doctors, artists, musicians, writers, and academics belong to
 professional associations which have the party-assigned
 function of controlling their memberships. Their contacts
 with foreign, especially Western-counterparts, are restricted;
 and foreign travel to attend conferences and take part in
 international exchanges is subject to control by party
 organizations.
 The Bulgarian Communist Party organizes and totally controls
 all Bulgarian labor unions; the head of the labor organization
 is a candidate member of the party's Politburo. Among the
 union's chief roles are the fostering of their members'
 devotion to the party, the promotion of patriotism and
 "internationalism" (i.e., loyalty to the Soviet Union), and
 the facilitation of the "scientific-technical revolution"
 (i.e., the technological modernization of production). A new
 labor code, in force since January 1987, and a "restructuring"
 of the trade unions in the spring of 1987 are putatively
 intended to shift the locus of union decisionmaking from the
 apex to its-base, but thus far there is.no indication that the
 role of the unions will substantially change, e.g., allowing
 trade union opposition to Party goals or policies.
 Workers are not permitted to organize outside the official
 union structure. Nor are they allowed to strike, although
 disgruntled workers in Mezdra engaged in a week-long stoppage
 in March. Trade unions have not defended workers dismissed
 from jobs for political transgressions. Security authorities
 may blacklist such workers from certain kinds of employment.
 
 
 865
 BULGARIA
 Bulgaria is a member of the International Labor Organization,
 and the unions maintain ties with Communist-controlled unions
 and labor confederations abroad.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of worship, the
 authorities espouse atheism and discourage religion. Openly
 expressed religious conviction is incompatible with party
 membership or attainment of responsible government or other
 positions. Policy directives adopted at the Thirteenth
 Bulgarian Comaunist Party Congress in April 1986 called for
 increased "ideological work against religious anachronisms"
 and promoting broader acceptance of "the Socialist festive and
 ritual system." Church-state relations are regulated by the
 Cormittee for Questions of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and
 Religious Cults, which is a division of the Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs. It reviews all clerical appointments and in
 the past has occasionally imposed clergy on local
 congregations over the opposition of the parishioners.
 A number of faiths are recognized or tolerated, including
 various Christian denominations, Islam, and Judaism. The
 Ba'hai faith and the Dunovist sect, an indigenous movement
 which flourished in pre-Communist Bulgaria, however, are
 outlawed. A case illustrative of the extent of religious
 freedom actually recognized in Bulgaria concerns a small
 Protestant congregation led by Pavel Ignatov. After years of
 unsuccessful attempts to secure official recognition, the
 congregation learned that in January 1987 Ignatov was to be
 sent into exile to the small and remote village of
 Nikhalkovo. The Government indicated that the action taken
 against Ignatov was the result of his "interference" against
 and "intrigues" within recognized churches; these charges
 appeared to stem from the fact that many of Ignatov's
 congregation were former members of recognized churches.
 Hundreds of Church of God members in the United States wrote
 to Bulgarian officials asking that Ignatov be freed and his
 church allowed to register. In the summer of 1987, Ignatov
 was allowed to return to Sofia from Mikhalkovo, but the
 Government continues to refuse to recognize his congregation
 as a church.
 The Bulgarian Orthodox Church, which was the established
 church before the Communists took power, is the largest and,
 in the Government's view, most acceptable church, given its
 historic role and continuing appeal to ordinary Bulgarians.
 The church receives substdntial government financial support
 and echoes government propaganda on such themes as peace and
 disarmament. It is allowed to print a newspaper, distill and
 market some alcoholic beverages, and sell some religious
 articles, sucbas candles and small- jewelry crosses.
 A Bulgarian-language Bible, only 2,000 copies of which were
 published in 1982 and distributed domestically, is now out of
 print, and no Bibles may be imported. Customs officials are
 assiduous in their efforts to discover and confiscate
 religious materials contained in the luggage or vehicles of
 arriving visitors.
 Although authorities generally do not interfere with older
 worshippers attending services, they sometimes try to dissuade
 young people from entering churches. Attendance at Easter
 services at Sofia's Aleksandur Nevsky Cathedral is restricted
 to those granted special "invitations," and police barricades
 
 
 866
 BULGARIA
 keep all others at least a block from the church. Easter
 attendance at other Sofia churches was massive in 1987, in
 spite of the presence of large numbers of uniformed police.
 Ethnic Turks comprise the majority of Bulgaria's Muslims, the
 remainder being Slavic Pomaks and Gypsies. Increased measures
 to di6dourage Islamic practices have figured prominently in
 the Government's campaign to eradicate the cultural identity
 of the Turkish community in Bulgaria. Muslim believers have
 been inhibited in the practice of their religion by the
 closure of many mosques and by prohibitions against the
 religious education of children. Although Sofia's mosque is
 slowly being renovated, many other mosques in areas with large
 Turkish populations have fallen into disrepair or have been
 converfed to other uses or closed. For example, in 1987 local
 officiald in Kurdzhali confirmed that there is only one
 functioning mosque in that' city of 7D;000 people, although a
 Communist Party publication in 1�86 'indicated, on the basis of
 sociological research, that about half of the adult population
 of Kurdzhali city is religious. Certain architecturally
 notable mosques, as in Razgrad, are in the process of extended
 renovation as "cultural monuments" but are not open for
 prayers.
 Copies of the Koran may not be imported and are not generally
 available tolMuslims in Bulgaria. Bulgarian citizens are not
 permitted to make the hajj (pilgrimage) to Mecca. Former
 National Assembly memner Halil Ibisoglu, who defected to
 Turkey in 1986, confirmed in press interviews that
 circumcision had been-banned in Bulgaria in 1985 and that male
 children were thereafter periodically examined to ensure that
 they had not been circumcised. Parents and others
 participat ng in circumcisions were subject to fine or
 imprisonment. The observance of Muslim holidays is
 discouraged. Many Muslim graveyards have been obliterated,
 and Muslim bdrial procedures are not permitted. All sermons
 must be-delivered in the Bulgarian language.
 The Jewish minority numbers about 5,000 people. Mistorically,
 Jews in Bulgaria have not suffered anti-Semitic persecution.
 Visits between the Bulgarian Jewish community and Israeli Jews
 of Bulgarian origin are frequent, although subject to
 government control. Sofia's Sephardic synagogue has received
 some government funds for refurbishment, but no progress in
 that project has been made, and religious services continue to
 be held in a small, overcrowded anteroom. The synagogue's
 prayer books are old, and no replacements are available. No
 kosher meat is available, but Jews are permitted to bake and
 distribute Passover matzoh without hindrance. A Jewish
 cultural, social, and educational organization exists, but it
 is atheistic and political in orientation. It publishes a
 secular newspaper stressing Comfhunist, anti-Zionist themes.
 Roman Catholics are few in number and divided between
 followers of the Latin and Uniate rites. A number of small
 Protestant churches (e.g., Evangelical, Baptist, Methodist,
 Seventh-Day Adventist) also function. In church sermons,
 preachers commonly avoid social and political themes. No
 religious groups may engage in open proselytizing, and foreign
 missionary activity is banned. Formal religious education of
 children is prohibited, although some young people attend
 church services with their parents.
 
 
 867
 BULGARIA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government controls where Bulgarians live, work, and
 travel. Citizens are required at all tines to carry with tham
 personal identity cards stating their legal place of residence
 and work. Without this card, they cannot register at a hotel,
 purchase domestic airline tickets, or seek any kind of social
 service such as medical assistance. Chauging one's place of
 residence or work is a complicated process unless it is at the
 Government's initiative or convenience. Moves to Sofia and
 other major cities from smaller settlements are especially
 difficult because cf the authorities' desire to control urban
 growth.  n!Sarianz may travel within the country vithout
 restriction except in border zones, which are extensive in
 some regions.
 Travel into areas with a heavily ethnic Turzich population
 appears to be subject to additional unpublished restrictions.
 The July 1987 Amnesty international repurt mentioned the case
 cf a Norwegian journalist who, in Novenher 1986, after
 receiving official assurances that he could travel freely
 within Bulgaria, was nonetheless stopped by roadblocks on
 various roads while attempting to visit ethnic Turkish areas.
 Foreign diplomats seeking to visit the Balkan village of
 Yablanovo--according to press accounts, the site of violent
 clashes between security forces and ethnic Turks during the
 1984-85 name change campaign--were repeatedly turned away by
 militia officers between February and October 1987, although
 Yablanovo is officially open to diplomatic travel.
 A Bulgarian citizen needs a passport for external travel and
 an exit visa specifying the destination for each trip. If a
 Bulgarian visits a country not specified in the exit visa or
 is delayed in returning to Bulgaria beyond the stipulated
 period, legal penalties may be imposed. Exit visas may be
 refused for a variety of reasons, e.g., political
 unreliability, or for no reason. When a Bulgarian is
 successful in obtaining an exit visa, a spouse or minor child
 is almost invariably required to remain in Bulgaria to ensure
 the traveler's return. In 1987 there was a significant
 increase in the number of Bulgarian citizens allowed to travel
 to the West compared to 1986.
 In principle, emigration is possible under Bulgarian law, but
 no right of emigration is recognized in practice. Many
 Bulgarians who wished to leave the country during 1987 were
 unable to acquire Bulgarian documentation to do so, including
 ethnic Turks who wished to emigrate to Turkey. The Government
 allowed one dissident, Dimitur Penchev, to emigrate to France
 with his family in July 1987 after his case received
 considerable attention in the French media. A number of
 divided family cases were favorably resolved with the
 emigration of Bulgarian citizens, as were several
 U.S.-Bulgarian marriage cases. A family visitation case
 pending since 1974 was finally concluded. Nevertheless,
 numerous divided family cases, many involving ethnic Turks,
 remained unsettled at the end of 1987.
 The Government encourages repatriation of ethnic Bulgarians
 residing abroad, although the right of repatriation is not
 guaranteed. A number of Bulgarian-born foreign residents and
 citizens return voluntarily to Bulgaria each year to live in
 retirement. Those who had left without permission or who had
 left with permission but stayed abroad without authorization
 
 
 868
 BULGARIA
 may be accepted for residence under an "amnesty" program, but
 the conditions of this program appear designed to ensure that
 those participating in it will be accorded only the status of
 Bulgarian citizens, without regard for rights they may have
 acquired abroad as citizens of other countries.
 It is Bulgarian policy to return to their home countries
 potential refugees from other Warsaw Pact states who have
 tried to cross the Bulgarian border into Greece, Turkey, or
 Yugoslavia.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government.
 Citizens do not have the right to change the system of
 government. The Bulgarian Communist Party leadership governs
 Bulgaria. Nonparty members are effectively denied any role in
 the formation of regime policy, and even rank-and-file party
 members have little influence over party policies.
 The regime tries to maintain the appearance of pluralism
 through the participation of a second "political party," the
 Bulgarian Naeional Agrarian Union, in the Government and the
 National Assembly. However, the Agrarian Party professes no
 differences of view on any issue with the Communist Party and
 does not contest National Assembly seats against it. Persons
 identified as "non-party" (i.e., "independent") also hold
 responsible government positions or National Assembly seats,
 but they are not known to profess views contrary to Communist
 Party policies. The Communist and Agrarian parties, together
 with labor, youth, and other groups, comprise a mass
 organization known as the Fatherland Front, which is wholly
 controlled by the Communist Party. Political pluralism and
 free participation in the political process do not exist.
 Until the present, the Fatherland Front has been the only
 organization permitted to present candidates for election; one
 candidate has been presented for each office, precluding ady
 choice on the part of the voters. Constitutional changes
 adopted in December 1987 provide for multicandidate elections
 on the local level, as well as for the National Assembly.
 There is no evidence, however, that the role of the Assembly
 as a mechanism for implementing into law policies determined
 by the Communist Party will be altered.
 Illustrative of the Government's attitude toward the exercise
 of political rights is the case of Stefan Dimitrov Cholakov
 who was arrested in 1981 in Vratsa and convicted of "antistate
 propaganda And agitation" because he had written to Bulgarian
 officials proposing himself as a National Assembly candidate
 with a program that, inter alia, would eliminate Communist
 Party officials in factories and government institutions as an
 unnecessary burden on the economy. He was also convicted of
 criticizing another "workers' state" because he wrote letters
 in favor of the independent Solidarity trade union movement in
 Poland and wore a Solidarity button. He was sentenced to 18
 months in prison but was released after 14 months in August
 1982. On September 9, 1987, Cholakov was detained by the
 militia in Vratsa for marching publicly with a sign reading "I
 support the decisions of the July 1987 BCP Plenum and the
 August 18, 1987 National Assembly for the elimination of the
 party and state administration and bureaucracy--revolutionary
 thinking. Stefan Cholakov." On that occasion, he was
 released after several hours.
 
 
 .869
 BULGARIA
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No independent domestic organizations to promote human rights
 exist in Bulgaria. In 1986 the National Assembly created a
 new legislative commission with the nominal function of
 defending "social interests and citizens' rights." The
 chairman of its subcommission on civil and political rights is
 a high official of the Communist Party Central Committee's
 department of social and national security policy.
 In early 1987, seven Bulgarian citizens sent a written appeal
 to the CSCE meeting in Vienna, asking that the meeting not be
 adjourned until effective institutional means had been created
 to oversee the implementation of the human rights commitments
 of the Helsinki accords. Most of the signers were
 subsequently detained and interrogated. One of the seven,
 Grigor Simov Bozhilov, after reportedly being temporarily
 confined in a mental institution, was sentenced to 2 years of
 exile in the remote village of Kaynardzha in northeastern
 Bulgaria.
 The Government regards any criticism of its human rights
 record as inadmissible and part of an "anti-Bulgarian
 campaign," and it denounced an April 1986 Amnesty
 International report on Bulgaria's Turkish minority in those
 terms. Government media have published numerous articles
 purporting to show that some of the Bulgarian Turks that
 Amnesty International reported to have been killed while
 resisting the name change campaign were not killed as
 claimed. The July 1987 Amnesty International report did not
 find the Bulgarian objections persuasive enough to require
 altering the general conclusion that Bulgarian authorities had
 committed and continued to commit extensive human rights
 violations against the ethnic Turkish minority.
 After considerable delays, members of the Islamic Conference
 Organization visited Bulgaria in 1987 (received by the
 Government in their "individual capacity") and toured Muslim
 areas of the country. Their conclusions are expected to be
 published in 1988.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination against the cultural, religious, and linguistic
 identity of the ethnic Turkish population has been noted above.
 Women are legally assured equal rights with men and do not
 appear to suffer overt discrimination as regards educational
 and professional opportunities. Women continue to be
 underrepresented in policymaking positions within the party
 and government, however, and overrepresented in many manual
 and lower-paying occupations.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 A new labor code adopted in 1986 codified and systematized
 much existing legislation. It stipulated 16 years as the
 minimum age for all but certain light work. Persons from 16
 to 18 years of age may not be assigned work designated as
 heavy, harmful, or dangerous; their workweek is either five
 7-hour days or six 6-hour days.
 
 
 .870
 BULGARIA
 The minimum wage is the local currency equivalent of about
 $120 per month at the official exchange rate, and the average
 wage is the local currency equivalent of about $210 per
 month. Especially in families with two working spouses, this
 provides, at best, a modest standard of living. The workweek
 for adults is 42.5 hours (5 days of 8'1/2 hours) in most
 professions and occupations. Paid vacations range from 14
 workdays annually, for those who have worked less than 10
 years, to 18 workdays annually, for those who have worked more
 than 15 years. Additional paid vacation is granted those in
 certain difficult or dangerous occupations. Bulgarian
 practice appears generally to conform to these guidelines,
 although.participation in unpaid supplementary "brigades" can
 lengthen w6rking hours on various occasions during the year.
 A national labor safety program exists, but stsndards of
 enforcemnnt vaty-greatly. Trade unions are assigned a role
 promoting job safety and-the general social welfare of their
 members.
