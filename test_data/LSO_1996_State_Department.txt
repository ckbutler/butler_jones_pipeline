 LESOTHO
 Lesotho is a constitutional monarchy. Prime Minister Ntsu Molhehle of the
 Basotholand Congress Party (BCP) is the Head of Government. Since winning free
 and fair elections in 1993, the BCP has controlled the Government and Parliament.
 Under the 1993 Constitution, the King has no executive authority. In 1994 King
 Letsie I unconstitutionally suspendedParliament and installed a Ruling Council.
 Local and international pressure led to a rapid return of constitutional government.
 The security forces consist of the Lesotho Defense Force (LDF), the Lesotho
 Mounted Police (LMP), and the National Security Service (NSS). The Government
 ado pted legislation to bring these services under more direct civilian control. The
 LDF now answers to the Prime Minister, through the Ministry of Defense. The NSS
 
 
 is directly accountable to the Prime Minister and the LMP reports to the Minister
 of Home Affairs. There were only isolated incidents of human rights abuses and dis-
 turbances.
 A landlocked country surrounded by South Africa, Lesotho is almost entirely de-
 pendent on its sole neighbor for trade, finance, employment, and access to the out-
 side world. A large proportion of the adult male work force is employed in mines
 in South Africa; miners' remittances account for slightly over one-third of gross na-
 tional product (GNP). Real GNP grew an estimated 12 percent during 1996, with
 inflation predited at less than 7 percent. Per capita GNP was a pproximately $790.
 State-owned organizations predominate in the agroindustrial and agribusiness see-
 tors, but private setor activity dominates in manufacturing and construction.
 Under the traditional chieftainship structure, land is controlled by the chiefs and
 owned by the Kingdom, precluding private ownership of land.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however,
 there continued to be problems in some areas. Discipline in the security services im-
 proved somewhat, but a few disturbances still occurred. Women's rights continued
 to be severely restricted, and domestic violence remained common. In September the
 police opened fire on striking construction workers, killing at least 4 and possibly
 as many as 15. In addition, the Government failed to prosecute anyone for
 extrajudicial killings and other abuses committed in previous years.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 kInSeptember the police opened fire on striking construction workers, killing at
 least 4 and possibly as many as 15 persons. The authorities did not investigate or
 prosecute any security officials for the extrajudicial or summary killings committed
 during the political unrest of 1994. They also failed to investigate 1994 reports of
 police brutality, as well as pre-1994 reports of deaths in police custody of a number
 of unionists and criminal suspects.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution expressly prohibits torture or inhuman or degrading punishment
 or other treatment, and there were no reports of its use. The Government did not
 investigate the numerous incidents that occurred in 1994 and previous years.
 Prison facilities are overcrowded and in disrepair, but conditions do not threaten
 the health or lives of inmates. Conditions are not monitored independently.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention, and there were no known incidents of these abuses. However,
 the Government failed to investigate or prosecute anyone for the arbitrary arrests,
 detentions, and harassment of civilians which occurred during 1995 and previous
 years. Members of the NSS arbitrarily detained cabinet members and other senior
 government officials.
 Pretrial detainees constitute a significant portion of total prison population, up to
 one-half in some locations. Because of backlogs, pretrial remand can last several
 years.
 Persons detained or arrested in criminal cases and defendants in civil cases have
 the right to legal counsel. The 1981 Criminal Procedures and Evidence Act, as
 amended in 1984, makes provision for granting bail. Bail is granted regularly and
 generally fairly.
 The Government has appealed the provisions of the Internal Security Act (ISA)
 of 1984 allowing for investigative detention.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary consists of the Court of Appeal
 (which meets semiannually), the High Court, magistrate's courts, and customary or
 traditional courts, which exist largely in rural areas to administer customary law.
 The High Court Chief Justice's decision in 1994 to swear in a provisional Ruling
 Council, in defiance of the Constitution, raised new questions about the independ-
 ence of the judiciary. In particular, magistrates appear susceptible to governmental
 or chieftainship influence. Accused persons have and use the right to counsel and
 public trial. The authorities generally respect court decisions and rulings.
 There is no trial by jury. Criminal trials are normally adjudicated by a single
 High Court judge who presides, with two assessors serving in an advisory capacity.
 In civil cases, judges normally hear cases alone. The High Court also provides proce-
 dural and substantive advice and guidance on matters of legal procedure to military
 tribunals; however, it does not participate in arriving at judgments. Military tribu-
 
 
 nals have jurisdiction only over military cases, and their decisions may not be ap-
 pealed. Both law and custom severely limit the rights of women (see Section 5), but
 court treatment of women is not discriminatory.
 There were no trials for political offenses. There were no reports of political pris-
 oners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Al.
 though search warrants are usually required under normal circumstances, the ISA
 provides police with wide powers to stop and search persons and vehicles and to
 enter homes and other places for similar purposes without a warrant. The security
 services are believed to monitor routinely telephone conversations of Basotho and
 foreigners on national security grounds.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for these rights,
 which are generally respected in practice. The independent newspapers, including
 one each controlled by the Roman Catholic and Lesotho evangelical churches, and
 two English-language weeklies, routinely criticize the Government. The official
 media, which consist of one radio station, a 1-hour daily newscast on a local tele-
 vision channel, and two weekly newspapers, faithfully reflect official positions.
 The Government has withdrawn all of its advertising from a local newspaper
 linked to a dissident faction of the ruling BCP. Four government ministers have
 friled a civil lawsuit against the newspaper, seeking compensation for alleged defa-
 mation. In addition Parliament questioned its editors at some length, implicitly
 threatening another civil lawsuit.
 The Government fully respects academic freedom. Although the Government owns
 and administers the country's only university-level institution of higher learning,
 academic staff represent the full political spectrum and are unhindered in express-
 ing their views.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Under a mid-1993 revision of
 the ISA, a public meeting, rally, or march no longer requires prior police permission,
 only advance notification. The police and local authorities generally respected these
 rights in 1996, unlike previous years. The Government did not investigate or pros-
 ecute any of the security personnel who killed and wounded several protestors at
 a peaceful 1994 progovernment demonstration.
 In addition to the BCP and the Basotholand National Party (BNP), there are sev-
 eral smaller political parties. Political party meetings and rallies occurred regularly
 throughout Lesotho. There are no restrictions on political parties.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Citizens generally are able to move freely within the country and across
 national boundaries. The Government places no obstacles in the way of citizens who
 wish to emigrate.
 In 1994 the Government allowed about 25 refugees to register with the U.N. High
 Commissioner for Refugees to study in Lesotho. They were expected to return to
 their countries of first asylum after completing their studies. Other than these stu-
 dents, Lesotho has no resident refugee population.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 In the first multiparty democratic elections in more than 20 years, the BCP swept
 into power in 1993 with complete control of the National Assembly. Despite the
 lands lide electoral victory, the BCP Government was forced to contend with a num-
 ber of challenges to its power in 1994. Those challenges culminated in August of
 that year when King Letsie II unconstitutionally suspended the Parliament and in-
 stalled a Ruling Council. Many Basotho responded by demonstrating their support
 for the democratically elected BCP Government. Organized labor and others held
 two national "stayaways" to demonstrate support for the ousted Government, and
 there were numerous rallies at the National University. As a result of both local
 and international pressure, the King reversed himself, and the BCP regained control
 of the Government.
 The 1994 Memorandum of Understanding between King Letsie HI and Prime
 Minister Mokhehle, which was brokered by South Africa, Botswana, and Zimbabwe,
 called for reinstatement of the King's father, Moshoeshoe II, who had been deposed
 by the previous military government and exiled in 1990, as well as steps to broaden
 the political process. In early 1995, Moshoeshoe H was reinstated. However, King
 Letsie once again became king upon the death of his father in January 1996. The
 
 
 146
 1994 suspension of the Constitution by Letsie, although short-lived, highlighted the
 fragility of constitutional rule.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government or poli-
 tics, but women remained underrepresented. There are 2 women in the 65-memhber
 Assembly and 7 women in the 33-member Senate. A woman serves as the Minister
 of Transportation and Communication.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government did not hinder the activities of various nongovernmental human
 rights groups. These groups freely criticized both the Government and the short-
 lived Ruling Council.). The Government was cooperative during an Amnesty Inter-
 national visit in 1994.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, Disability, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race color, sex language, reli-
 gion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, birth or other status, and
 the Government generally respected these prohibitions in practice.
 Women.-Domestic violence, including wife beating, occurs frequently. Statistics
 are not available, but the problem is believed to be widespread. In Basotho tradition
 a wife may return to her "maiden home" if physically abused by her husband; in
 common law, wife beating is a criminal offense and defined as assault. Few domestic
 violence cases are brought to trial. Women's rights organizations, such as the local
 chapter of the International Federation of Women Lawyers, have taken a leading
 role in educating women regarding their rights under customary and common law,
 highlighting the importance of women fully participating in the democratic process.
 Both law and custom severely limit the rights of women in such areas as property,
 inheritance, and contracts. Women have the legal and customary right to make a
 will and sue for divorce. However, under customary law, a married woman is consid-
 ered a minor during the lifetime of her husband; she cannot enter into any legally
 binding contract, whether for employment, commerce, or education, without her hus-
 band's consent. A woman married under customary law has no standing in court
 and may not sue or be sued without her husband's permission. Senior government
 officials have publicly criticized customary practice which discriminates against
 women. The Government has committed to implement the plan of action from the
 Fourth International Conference on Women, held in Beijing in September 1995.
 Children.-The Government has not addressed directly children's rights and wel-
 fare, although it has devoted substantial resources to primary and secondary edu-
 cation. There is no pattern of societal abuse against children, but many children
 work at a young age (see Section 6.d.).
 People With Disabilities.-Discrimination against physically disabled persons in
 employment, education, or provision of other government services is unlawful. How-
 ever, societal discrimination is common.
 The Government has not legislated or mandated accessibility to public buildings
 for the disabled.
 National /Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Most citizens speak a common language and
 share common historical and cultural traditions. Small numbers of Asians (pri-
 marily ethnic Chinese and Indians) and South African whites are active in the coun-
 try's commercial life. Economic and racial tension between the Chinese business
 community, specifically textile and garment industry employers, and the Basotho re-
 mained a problem.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the legal right to join or form unions
 without prior government authorization. A large percentage of the male labor force
 works in gold and coal mines in South Africa. The remainder are primarily engaged
 in traditional agriculture. There are small public and industrial sectors. A majority
 of Basotho mine workers are members of the South African National Union of
 Mineworkers (NUM). However, as a foreign organization, the NUM is not permitted
 to engage in union activities in Lesotho.
 Under the 1993 Labor Code, prepared with the assistance of the International
 Labor Organization (ILO), all trade union federations reuire government registra-
 tion. There are two trade union federations: The Lesotho Trade Union Congress and
 the Lesotho Federation of Democratic Unions. Unions are not tied to political par-
 ties. Overall, unionized workers represent only about 10 percent of the work force.
 No legally sanctioned strike has occurred since independence in 1966. Legal pro-
 tection for strikers against retribution has not always been enforced in cases of ille-
 gal strikes. Employers dismissed several hundred textile workers following wildcat
 
 
 strikes in 1994, and the Government maintained it could not oblige their employers
 to reinstate them. The Government was, however, successful in negotiating the rein-
 statement of employees following several illegal strikes in 1995 and 1996. Security
 forces violently suppressed some of the strikes in the textile, garment, and construc-
 tion industries during 1994 and once during 1996.
 There were no instances of governmental restrictions on international affiliations
 or contacts by unions or their members.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-All legally recognized trade
 unions in principle enjoy the right to organize and bargam co llectively, but in prac-
 tice the authorities often restrict these rights. Although there was some bargaining
 between unions and employers to set wage and benefit rates, employers generally
 continued to set wage rates through unilateral action.
 Lesotho has several industrial zones, in which mostly textile and apparel firms
 engage in manufacturing for export. All national labor laws apply in these industrial
 zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The 1987 Employment Act pro-
 hibits forced or compulsory labor, and there is no indication that such labor is prac-
 ticed.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment in commercial or industrial enterprises is 14. In practice, however, chil-
 dren under 14 are often employed in the textile and garment sector and in family-
 owned businesses. As much as 15 percent of the textile work force of some 15,000
 may be children between the ages of 12 and 15, according to a 1994 study by a for-
 eign government. After visiting all 14 of Lesotho's nonartisan garment producers in
 1994, the ILO, responding to a complaint by trade unions in the textile and clothing
 industry, was not able to confirm the unions' allegation of illegal child labor.
 There are prohibitions against the employment of minors in commercial, indus-
 trial, or nonfianily enterprises involving hazardous or dangerous working conditions,
 but enforcement is very lax. The Ministry of Labor and Employment's Inspectorate
 is severely understaffed. Basotho youth under 18 years of age may not be recruited
 for employment outside of Lestho. In traditional society, rigorous working condi-
 tions for the ounty's young "herdboys" are onsidered a prerequisite to manhood
 and a fundamental feature of Bastho culture beyond the reach of labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Wages are low. The monthly minimum wage
 for unskilled labor is $68 (320 maloti); for a heavy vehicle operator it is $131 (616
 maloti). Minimum wages in lower skilled jobs are insufficient to ensure a decent
 standard of living for a worker and family. Most wage earners supplement their in-
 come through subsistence agriculture or remittances from relatives employed in
 South Africa. Many employers now pay more than minimum wages in an effort to
 attract and retain motivated employees.
 The labor code spells out basic worker rights, including a maximum 45-hour work-
 week, a weekly rest period of at least 24 hours, 12 days of paid leave per year, and
 paid public holidays. The Code requires employers to provide adequate light, ven-
 tilation, and sanitary facilities for employees and to install and maintain machinery
 in a manner deslgned to minimize the risk of injury. In practice employers generally
 follow these regulations only within the wage economy in urban areas, and the Min-
 istry of Labor and Employment enforces the regulations haphazardly. The Labor
 does not explicitly protect the right of workers to remove themselves from haz-
 ardous situations without prejudice to employment. However, labor code sections on
 safety in the workplace and dismissal imply that dismissal in such circumstances
 would be illegal.
