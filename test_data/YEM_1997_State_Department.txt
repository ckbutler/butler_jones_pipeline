 YEMEN
 The Republic of Yemen, comprising the former (northern) Yemen Arab Republic
 and (southern) People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, was proclaimed in 1990. The
 first democratically elected parliament was convened in 1993. Following a brief but
 blood civil war in mid-1994, the country was reunified under the rule of the
 Sana a-based government. Later in 1994, a new postwar governing coalition was
 formed, composed of the General People's Congress (GPC) and the Yemeni Grouping
 for Reform (Islaah). Field Marshal Ali Abdullah Saleh is the President and leader
 of the GPC. He was elected by the legislature in 1994 to a 5-year term. A constitu-
 tional amendment provides that henceforth the president is to be elected by popular
 vote from at least two candidates selected by the legislature. Parliamentary elec-
 tions were held in April, with the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP), formerly the main
 party of the south and a previous coalition partner, leading an opposition boycott.
 The GPC won an absolute majority of the new parliament. International observers
 judged the April parliamentary elections, which, like the 1993 voting, were held on
 thelbasis of universal adult suffrage, as reasonably free and fair. However, the Par-
 liament is not yet an effective counterweight to executive authority. Real political
 power rests with a few leaders, particularly the President. The judiciary, nominally
 independent, is weak and severely hampered by corruption, executive branch inter-
 ference, and the frequent failure of the authorities to carry out sentences.
 The primary state security apparatus is the Political Security Organization (PSO),
 which reports directly to the President. It is independent of the Ministry of Interior.
 The Criminal Investigative Department (CID) of the police conducts most criminal
 investigations and makes most arrests. The Central Security Organization (CSO),
 a part of the Ministry of Interior, maintains a paramilitary force. The civilian au-
 thorities did not maintain effective control of the security forces. Some members of
 the security forces, particularly the PSO, committed numerous, serious human
 rights abuses.
 Yemen is a very poor country. Its embryonic market-based economy, despite a
 major economic reform program, remains impeded by excessive government inter-
 ference and endemic corruption. Its annual per capita gross national product (GNP)
 is estimated at $325..Agriculture accounts for approximately 18 percent of GNP and
 industry for approximately 8 percent. Oil is the primary source of foreign exchange.
 Other exports include fish, agricultural products, tton, and building materials. Re-
 mittances from citizens working abroad (primarily in Saudi Arabia) are also impor-
 tant. Remittances were sharply reduced after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states
 expelled up to 850,000 Yemeni workers during the Gulf War because of the Govern-
 ment's lack of support for the U.N. coalition. The Gulf states also suspended most
 assistance programs, and much other western aid was reduced. Foreign aid is begin-
 ning to reemerge as an importance source of income.
 The Government's human rights record continued to be poor, although late in the
 year the Government took initiatives to combat some human rights problems. There
 are significant limitations on citizens' right to change their government. There were
 unconfirmed reports of extrajudicial killing by some members of the security forces.
 Some members of the security forces tortured and otherwise abused persons. Prison
 conditions are poor. Some members of the security forces continued to arbitrarily ar-
 rest and detain citizens, especially persons still regarded as "separatists." PSO offi-
 cers have broad discretion over perceived national security issues, and, despite con-
 stitutional constraints, routinely detain citizens for questioning, mistreat detainees,
 monitor citizens' activities, and search their homes. The Government rarely held
 members of the security forces accountable for human rights abuses. Indeed, the se-
 curity forces sometimes countermanded orders from the President and the Interior
 Ministry. After a series of bombings incidents which began in Aden in August, secu-
 
 
 1595
 
 rity forces rounded up more than 120 suspects, most of whom were held in incom-
 municado detention for several weeks without formally being charged. Eventually
 most of the detainees were released, two groups of 27 and 31 persons, respectively,
 were brought to trial in connection with the bombings, amid charges of violations
 of the rights of the accused. Security forces made additional arrest after a series
 of bombings in October. Prolonged pretrial detention is a serious problem, and judi-
 cial corruption, inefficiency, and executive interference undermine due process. The
 Constitution limits freedom of speech and the press, and the Government harassed,
 intimidated, and detained journalists. Journalists practice self-censorship. The Gov-
 ernment imposes some restrictions on freedom of religion. Discrimination based on
 sex, race, disability, social status, and to a lesser extent, religion, exists. Violence
 against women is a problem. Female genital mutilation is practiced by some fami-
 lies, especially along the coastal areas on the Red Sea; although publicly discour-
 aged, the authorities do not prohibit it.
 In reaction to a March report by Amnesty International (Al), the Government an-
 nounced that it would investigate some of the issues raised, including cases of dis-
 appearance, arbitrary arrest, and torture, in addition to the situation of women.
 However, it rejected some of Ar's allegations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Some members of the security forces
 have committed extrajudicial killings. In April Abdullah Ahmed Barkani, a soldier
 on night duty, opened fire at a polling station and killed five soldiers and three civil-
 ians.
 There were unconfirmed reports that two soldiers were killed by their military su-
 periors, apparently as a result of excessive use of corporal punishment. Awadh Mu-
 barak, a soldier based in Hadramaut Governorate, reportedly died in May from inju-
 ries sustained during a beating by his military superiors. During the same week,
 another soldier died at al-Thawra military camp. He reportedly had been beaten
 with metal skewers.
 There were reports that two persons who were arrested after the July bombings
 in Aden died as a result of torture inflicted by the security forces. The Government
 stated that only one man died, and that he committed suicide.
 The 1996 case of a YSP activist who died in police custody remains unresolved.
 The youth had been arrested following his participation in a peaceful demonstration
 in Mukallah. No member of the security forces has been charged in connection with
 his death.
 Several persons died during the election registration process and on election day
 during violent incidents at polling places. Most of these deaths were attributed to
 underlying tribal disputes connected to the elections.
 b. Disappearance.-Members of the security forces continue to arrest and detain
 citizens for varying periods of time without charge or notification to the families
 concerned. Many detainees, especially in southern governorates, are associated with
 the YSP or other opposition parties and accused of being "separatists." Most such
 disappearances are temporary, and detainees are released within months. Such was
 the case of persons arrested in connection with the July 28 bombings (see Section
 1.d.)
 Amnesty International presented a "sample" list of 28 persons who reportedly
 "disappeared" while in government custody in the years 1994 to 1996. The Govern-
 ment promised to look into these cases. AI also alleged that there were hundreds
 of unresolved disappearances dating from the pre-union period, and particularly
 from the year 1986. In late 1997, the Foreign Ministry created a special office for
 human rights. The office has set up a computer data base for tracking persons al-
 leged to have "disappeared" in the past, particularly in the former People's Demo-
 cratic Republic of Yemen during the 1986 southern civil war. This office was created
 specifically to respond to Amnesty International's continuing assertion that the Gov-
 ernment refuses to account for "disappeared" persons.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution, which asserts that Shari'a (Islamic law) "is the source of all legis-
 lation," is ambiguous on its prohibition of cruel or inhuman punishment. However,
 there were reports that members of the security forces tortured and otherwise
 abused persons. Although there is no evidence of the systematic use of torture in
 detention facilities, arresting authorities are known to use force during interroga-
 tions, especially of those arrested for violent crimes. The Government in late 1997
 banned the use of heavy leg-irons and shackles.
 
 
 1596
 According to a local human rights organization, many instances of torture have
 taken place at Amran prison. The organization reported that it had received first-
 hand evidence of the torture of one prisoner in Amran. Another credible source con-
 firmed the torture of a non-Yemeni citizen in a Sanaa detention facility. Amnesty
 International reported numerous cases of torture from previous years for which no
 security officials have been held accountable. The Government acknowledged to Am-
 nesty International that torture takes place, but said that the use of torture is not
 government policy. A high-level prosecutor reported to a Yemeni newspaper in late
 1996 that six cases of torture by security officials had been referred to the courts
 that year. The prosecutor cited illiteracy and lack of training among police and secu-
 rity officials as one of the reasons for the persistence of undue force in the prisons.
 There were reports that security forces tortured two men arrested after the July
 bombings in Aden, causing their deaths. The Government stated that only one man
 died, and that he committed suicide (see Section L.a.).
 The Constitution states that the Government may not impose "illegal" punish-
 ments-a formulation that could be interpreted as permitting amputations accord-
 ing to Shari'a. There were no reports of amputations since 1991. The Shari'a-based
 law permits physical punishments such as flogging for minor crimes (e.g., the pen-
 alty for the consumption of alcohol is 80 lashes). It also provides for the ritual dis-
 play in pubic of the bodies of executed criminals. In August, a judge in Seiyun sen-
 tenced two tribesmen to death by firing squad and ordered their bodies to be dis-
 played in public. The judgment was in reaction to the pair's brutal slaying of a fam-
 ily of three persons. The sentence was upheld by President Saleh and carried out
 on August 4 with thousands of onlookers watching. The culprits were first shot by
 a military firing squad, which hung the bodies on the city wall for a 24-hour period.
 The purpose of this practice is to demonstrate to the families of victims that justice
 has been done and to avoid blood feuds between tribes.
 Prison conditions are poor and do not meet internationally recognized minimum
 standards. Prisons are overcrowded, sanitary conditions are poor, and food and
 health care are inadequate. Inmates must depend on relatives for food and medi-
 cine. Many inmates lack mattresses or bedding. Prison authorities often exact
 money from prisoners and-refuse to release prisoners until family members pay a
 bribe. Tribal leaders misuse the prison system by placing "problem" tribesmen in
 jail, either to punish them for non-criminal indiscretions or to protect them from
 ang   mobs.
 Conditions are equally poor in women sprisons, where children are likely to be
 incarcerated along with their mothers. Female prisoners are regularly held in jail
 past the expiration of their sentences, and are not released until a male relative ar-
 ranges their release. Female prisoners are sometimes subjected to sexual harass-
 ment, rape, and violent interrogation by male police and prison officials. At the urg-
 ing of Al, the Attorney General agreed to investigate the conditions of women in
 prison.
 The Government tightly controls access to detention facilities. It allows local and
 international human rights monitors access to persons accused of crimes. However,
 it allows no access to political prisoners. For example, it did not permit access to
 any of the detainees arrested in the wake of the July 28 bombings in Aden.
 In December the Human Rights Committee of the Consultative Council (an advi-
 sory board to the President) conducted a tour of the major prisons and reported that
 many prisoners were in jail without "proper legal basis." The visits prompted the
 -immediate release of 112 persons, including several women and children. The Com-
 mittee fired (with the backing of President Saleh) six prison officials found to be cor-
 rupt and incompetent. The Consultative Council is calling for a restructuring of re-
 sponsibilities among the three bureaucracies responsible for the prisons-the Min-
 istry of Interior, the offices of the district attorneys, and the court system.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law provides for due process, how-
 ever, security forces arbitrarily arrest and detain persons. Enforcement is irregular
 and in some cases nonexistent, particularly in cases involving security offenses. Ac-
 cording to the law, detainees must be arraigned within 24 hours of arrest or re-
 leased. The judge or prosecuting attorney must inform the accused of the basis for
 the arrest and decide whether detention is required. In no case may a detainee be
 held longer than 7 days without a court order. Despite these constitutional and
 other legal provisions, arbitrary arrest and prolonged detention without charge are
 common practices.
 Following a series of explosions that took place in Aden in July, October, and No-
 vember, security forces rounded up several groups of suspects and the Government
 announced that it had unearthed a terrorist "ring" with links to foreign powers. The
 Government said that the terrorists were planning a large conspiracy to destabilize
 the Government, to include the killing of Yemeni and foreign officials. The final
 
 
 1597
 
 total of those arrested is estimated at more than 200 persons. Eventually most of
 those arrested were released without ever being charged with any crime. However,
 two separate groups of 31 and 27 individuals, respectively, were formally charged
 and brought to trial in late November. The cases were still under way at year's end.
 The law provides detainees with the right to inform their families of their arrests
 and to decline to answer questions without an attorney present. There are provi-
 sions for bail. In practice, many authorities respect these rights only if bribed. The
 majority of persons detained in connection with the Aden bombings were not per-
 mitted contact with their families or lawyers and were denied bail.
 In cases where a criminal suspect is at large, security forces sometimes detain a
 relative while the suspect is being sought. The detention may continue while the
 concerned families negotiate compensation for the alleged wrongdoing. Arbitration,
 rather than the court system, is commonly used to settle cases.
 The Government has failed to ensure that detainees and prisoners are incarcer-
 ated only in authorized detention facilities. The Ministry of Interior and the PSO
 operate extrajudicial detention facilities. A large percentage of the total prison popu-
 lation consists of pretrial detainees. Thousands of people have been imprisoned for
 years without documentation concerning charges against them, their trials, or their
 sentences. It is believed that at least some of these persons are political detainees.
 Most of the persons arrested after the Aden bombings apparently had nothing to
 do with the crime and were detained merely because of their affiliation with the po-
 litical opposition.
 While a few cases of those being held without charge have been redressed through
 the efforts of local human rights groups (and a few illegally detained prisoners have
 been released), the authorities have done nothing to investigate or resolve these
 cases. However, the Government acknowledged to AI that security officials must be
 held more accountable to the judicial system.
 Unauthorized, private prisons also exist in tribal areas, where the central govern-
 ment exercises very little authority. People detained in these prisons are often held
 for strictly personal reasons and without trial or sentencing.
 Some tribes seek to bring their political and economic concerns to the attention
 of the Government by kidnaping and holding hostages. Victims include foreign busi-
 nessmen, diplomats, and tourists, as well as Yemenis. According to a 1997 study by
 the newspaper al-Wadah, for example, there were 105 kidnaping cases in 1995
 alone. Foreign victims are rarely injured, and the authorities generally have been
 successful in obtaining the quick release of foreign hostag es. However, it is widely
 believed that kidnapings continue because the judiciary fails to implement sentences
 against accused kidnapers. Indeed, in most cases the kidnapings are settled out of
 court, and no suspects go to trial.
 The Government does not use forced exile. At the end of the 1994 civil war, the
 President pardoned nearly all persons who had fought against the central Govern-
 ment, including military personnel and most leaders of the unrecognized, secession-
 ist Democratic Republic of Yemen (DRY). The Government denied this amnesty only
 to the 16 most senior leaders of the DRY, who fled abroad, and one of whom is now
 presumed dead. Although they were technically not forced into exile, they are sub-
 ject to arrest if they return. The so-called "trial of the 16," which began in late 1996,
 is in progress. The accused are being tried in absentia on various charges, including
 forming a secessionist government, conspiracy, and forming a separate military. De-
 fense lawyers claim that the prsecution's case is illegal because it depends on the
 application of pre-union laws that had been superseded by post-unification laws
 prior to the commission of the alleged offenses.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The judiciary is not fully independent, even
 though the Constitution provides for an autonomous" judiciary and "independent
 judges." Judges are appointed by the executive branch, and some have been reas-
 signed or removed from office following rulings against the Government. Many liti-
 gants maintain, and the Government acknowledges, that a judge's social ties and
 susceptibility to bribery sometimes have greater influence on the verdict than the
 law or the facts of the case. Some judges appointed since mid-1994 are poorly
 trained, and some of those closely associated with the Government often render de-
 cisions favorable to it. The judiciary is further hampered by the frequent reluctance
 of the authorities to implement sentences.
 There are five types of courts: criminal, civil (i.e., divorce and inheritance), admin-
 istrative, commercial, and military.
 All courts are governed by Shari'a law. There are no jury trials under Shari'a.
 Criminal cases are adjudicated by a judge who plays an active role in questioning
 witnesses and the accused. By law, defense attorneys are allowed to counsel their
 clients, to address the court and to examine witnesses. Defendants, including those
 in commercial courts, have the right to appeal their sentences. Trials are public.
 
 
 1598
 However, all courts may conduct closed sessions "for reasons of public security or
 morals." Foreign litigants in commercial disputes have complained of biased rulings.
 However, some foreign companies have reported winning cases against Yemeni de-
 fendants and seeing the decisions enforced.
 The law permits, in addition to regular courts, a system of tribal adjudication. The
 results of such mediation carry the same weight as court judgments. This provision
 of law explains in part why so many persons who spend time in jail are never actu-
 ally charged with any crime.
 Prior to unification, approximately half of the judges working in southern Yemen
 were women. In the last few years, however, many female judges have been reas-
 signed to administrative or clerical duties. There are no female judges in the north.
 A total of 58 suspects were charged with conspiracy, espionage, and related crimes
 after a series of bombings in Aden in the latter half of the year. Their trials, which
 were under way at yea end, do not appear to meet minimum international stand-
 ards for due process. There are reports that confessions were coerced, and that de-
 fendants were denied the opportunity to consult with their lawyers.
 The Government claims that it holds no political prisoners, and releases no data
 on such cases. However, this claim is disputed by many local and international
 human rights groups, who report that various political prisoners were convicted
 after unfair trials.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Despite
 constitutional provisions against government interference with privacy, security
 forces routinely search homes and private offices, monitor telephones, read personal
 mail, and otherwise intrude into personal matters for alleged security reasons. Such
 activities are conducted without legally issued warrants or judicial supervision. Se-
 curity forces regularly monitor telephone conversations and have interfered with the
 telephone service of government critics and opponents. Security forces sometimes
 detain relatives of suspects (see Section 1.d.).
 In April security personnel broke into the Aden headquarters of the League of the
 Sons of Yemen (RAI), an opposition party affiliated with the exiled, foreign-financed
 Mawj opposition. According to the RAI, the security forces rummaged through files
 and desks, confiscated office supplies and equipment, and sealed the offices. Also in
 April, the secretary general of the Yemeni  oialist Party (YSP) was stopped while
 being driven through Aden. His bodyguards were disarmed, interrogated, and phys-
 ically abused.
 The law prevents arrests between the hours of sundown and dawn. However, most
 of those detained in connection with the Aden bombings were taken from their
 homes in the middle of the night, without search warrants.
 Some of those detained in connection with the Aden bombings reportedly were
 pressured to renounce their affiliations with opposition parties. They were threat-
 ened with continuing confinement in prison if they did not give up political activity
 or join the Presidents party, the GPC.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution restricts the freedom of speech
 and press "within the limits of the law." Although most citizens are uninhibited in
 their private discussions of domestic and foreign policies, some are cautious in pub-
 lic, fearing harassment for criticism of the Government. The Press Law criminalizes
 "the humiliation of the State, the Cabinet, or parliamentary institutions," and the
 publication of "false information" that "threatens public order or the public interest."
 The Government influences the media and limits press freedom.
 The relative freedom of the press permitted between unification (1990) and the
 civil war (1994) has not been reestablished fully. An atmosphere of government
 pressure on independent and political party journals continues that was not present
 ore the civil war. The international human rights group, the Committee to Pro-
 tect Journalists, criticized the Government on at least two occasions for restrictions,
 harassment, and arbitrary detention directed at journalists.
 The Ministry of Information influences the media by its ownership of the coun-
 try's sole television and radio outlets, by its control of most printing presses, and
 by subsidies to certain newspapers. Only one newspaper, the twice-weekly Aden
 independent A-Ayyam, owns its own press. The Government selects the items to
 be covered in news broadcasts, and does not permit broadcast reporting critical of
 the Government. Televised debates in the Parliament are edited to delete such criti-
 cism.
 Although newspapers are allowed to criticize the Government, journalists some-
 times censor themselves, especially when writing on such sensitive issues as govern-
 ment policies toward the southern governates, relations with Saudi Arabia and
 other foreign governments, or official corruption. The penalties for exceeding these
 
 
 1599
 self-imposed limits can be arrest for libel, dismissal from employment, or extralegal
 harassment.
 In a case from 1995, two journalists for AI-Shoura newspaper were found guilty
 in May of slander and character assassination against an un! ortant sheikh, one of
 the leaders of the Islaah party. The presiding judge ordered that the newspaper be
 shut down; that the journalists be flogged with 80 lashes and stopped from work
 for 1 year, and that they pay a compensation of approximately $800 (100,000 yr).
 The Ministry of Justice has suspended this judgment while reviewing its conformity
 with law and judicial procedure. Al-Shoura continued to operate at year's end. Al-
 Shoura had suffered government harassment in the past; security officials closed the
 paper from mid-1995 through mid-1996, when a judge ruled that the closure was
 illegal.
 In early 1997, a trial began against Muhammad Al-Saqaf, a journalist and former
 university professor who had written articles critical of the Government in the
 weekly government-controlled paper Al-Wahda in 1996. Specifically, AI-Saqaf had
 questioned the Government's handling of preparations for the 1997 election. The
 Committee to Protect Journalists interceded with the Government on his behalf.
 The case is continuing.
 The weekly opposition newspaper AI-Tajammu' continued to be subjected to minor
 harassment from government authorities. In 1996 the paper's publishers tempo-
 rarily had been denied access to government presses because of criticism of the Gov-
 ernment.
 There were reports throughout the year of journalists (particularly in the south)
 being subjected to minor but frequent physical harassment, abuse, and short periods
 of arbitrary incarceration. At least six of the persons arrested in connection with
 the Aden bombings were journalists. The Committee to Protect Journalists and
 other international and local human rights organizations protested to the Govern-
 ment on their behalf. The journalists eventually were released without charge.
 Customs officials confiscate foreign publications regarded as pornographic or ob-
 jectionable because of religious or political content. The Ministry of Information rou-
 tinely delayed the distribution of international Arabic-language dailies such as Al-
 Hayat and A1-Sharq A1-Awsat in an apparent effort to decrease their sales in
 Yemen. In almost all cases, this was because they carried news about or statements
 by leaders of the 1994 secession attempt.
 To ublish a book in Yemen, the author must obtain a permit from the Ministry
 of Culture. In the end most books are approved, but the process is time-consuming
 for the author. The author must submit copies of the book to the Ministry. Officials
 at the National Library must read and endorse the text. It is then submitted to a
 special committee for final approval. If a book is not deemed appropriate for publica-
 ti n, the Ministry simply does not issue a decision. Publishers do not usually deal
 with an author who has not yet obtained the permit.
 Academic freedom is somewhat restricted by the extreme politicization of univer-
 sity campuses. Many administrators, professors, and students align themselves with
 either the ruling GPC party or the opposition Islaah party. Each group closely mon-
 itors the activities of the other. Islaah members have intimidated students and pro-
 fessors from discussing topics of which they disapprove. Top administrative posi-
 tions are usually awarded to political allies.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-There are no constitutional re-
 strictions on the right to assemble peacefully, although the Government requires a
 permit for these purposes. Government informers monitor meetings and assemblies.
 Angry citizens launched several sit-ins, hunger strikes, and other peaceful dem-
 onstrations in reaction to the Government's security crackdown following the Aden
 bombings. In at least one instance demonstrators were refused a permit to assem-
 ble. On September 10, several thousand persons demonstrated in Mukallah against
 the continued holding of detainees. The demonstrators had applied for but been de-
 nied a permit. The Government allowed the demonstration to take place without in-
 terference.
 There are no constitutional restrictions on the freedom of association, and the
 Government generally respects this right in practice. Associations must obtain an
 operating license from the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, usually a routine
 matter.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the state religion. Although followers of other
 religions are free to worship according to their beliefs, there are some restrictions
 on their other activities. Most notably, they are prohibited from proselytizing.
 Virtually all citizens are Muslims, either of the Zaydi branch of Shi'a Islam or the
 Shafa'i branch of Sunni Islam. There are also some Ismailis in the north. Private
 Islamic organizations may maintain ties to pan-Islamic organizations and operate
 schools, but the Government monitors their activities.
 
 
 1600
 Most Christians are foreign residents, except for a few families of Indian origin
 in Aden. There are several churches and Hindu temples in Aden, but no non-Muslim
 public places of worship in the former north Yemen. Church services are regularly
 held without harassment in private homes or facilities such as schools. However, oc-
 casionally the security authorities censor the mail of Christian clergy who minister
 to the foreign community, ostensibly to prevent proselytizing.
 Nearly all Yemen's once sizable Jewish population has emigrated. There are no
 legal restrictions on those Jews who remain, although their are traditional restric-
 tions on places of residence and choice of employment (see Section 5).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-In general, the Government does not obstruct domestic travel, although
 the army and security forces maintain checkpoints on major roads. Likewise, the
 Government does not routinely obstruct foreign travel or the right to emigrate and
 return. Journalists must have a permit to travel abroad. Women must obtain per-
 mission from a male relative before applying for a passport or departing the coun-
 try. However, enforcement of the restrictions on journalists and women are irregu-
 lar. The Constitution prohibits the extradition of a citizen to any country.
 Immigrants and refugees traveling within the country are often required by secu-
 rity officials at government checkpoints to show that they possess resident status
 or refugee identification cards.
 The Government in 1997 offered first asylum to some 51,500 Somali refugees who
 were forced to flee the fighting in that country. It also cooperated with the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in assisting refugees from Eri-
 trea (2,500 persons), Ethiopia (1,200 persons) and various other countries (750 per-
 sons). It permitted the UCR to monitor the situation of 20,000 Iraqis in Yemen,
 many of whom could become of concern to UNHCR because of the situation in Iraq.
 The UNHCR provides food and medical assistance to up to 7,000 Ethiopians in
 a temporary refugee camp at Al Jahin. The Government has approved a new
 UNHCR facility to be built at a site in Lahaj Governorate in the near future.
 The Government has granted refugee status to some persons and resettled them.
 Approximately 30,000 Somali refugees have now been integrated into Yemeni soci-
 ety and are no longer receiving food from the UNHCR. However, they are still eligi-
 ble for medical treatment at UNHCR facilities.
 In past years, human rights organizations had alleged that the Government forced
 certain refugees to return to countries in which they feared prosecution. However,
 this has notbeen a problem in recent years.
 The UNHCR facilitated the voluntary repatriation of Eritrean and Ethiopian refu-
 gees, and also facilitated the voluntary return of some Somali refugees to areas of
 Somalia that are considered safe.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although the Government is by law accountable to the Parliament, there are sig-
 nificant limitations on the ability of the people to change their government. Inter-
 national observers judged the April parliamentary elections as "reasonably free and
 fair" despite some problems associated with the voting. To date, the Parliament is
 not an effective counterweight to executive authority; it does little more than debate
 issues. Decisionmaking and real political power still rest in the hands of a few lead-
 ers, particularly the President.
 The President has the authority to introduce legislation and promulgate laws by
 decree when Parliament is not in session. Decrees must be approved by Parliament
 30 days after reconvening. In theory, if a decree is not approved, it does not become
 law; in practice, a decree remains in effect even if not approved. The President ap-
 points the Prime Minister, who forms the Government. The Cabinet comprises 24
 ministers, all of whom are now from the GPC.
 Following the 1997 elections, the President announced the formation of a Consult-
 ative Council, a board of notables chaired by the former Prime Minister, to advise
 him on certain policy matters. Some observers have compared this council to an
 "upper chamber" like the United States Senate. The Council reviews and advises
 the President on all laws that are submitted to the Chamber of Deputies. However,
 the Council has no constitutional powers. It is not elected; it is appointed by the
 President.
 In some governorates, tribal leaders retain considerable discretion in the interpre-
 tation and enforcement of the law. Central government authority in these areas is
 often weak.
 The multiparty system is functional but arguably weaker than in 1993, when the
 first parliamentary elections were held. All parties must be registered in accordance
 with the Political Parties Law of 1991, which stipulates that each party must have
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 1601
 at least 75 founders and at least 2,500 members. Twelve parties participated in the
 April elections, compared with to 16 in 1993. The YSP and several smaller parties
 boycotted the election, leading to lower voter turnout in the south than in 1993.
 The Constitution prohibits the establishment of parties that are contrary to Islam,
 oppose the goals of the Yemeni revolution, or violate Yemen's international commit-
 ments. The Government provides financial support to all parties represented in Par-
 liament. The parties are permitted to publish their own newspapers.
 Although women may vote and hold office, these rights are limited by cultural and
 religious customs. Only 2 women were elected to the Parliament in April (the same
 number as in 1993), and few hold senior leadership positions in the government or
 political parties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Yemeni Human Rights Organization (YHRO) is the best organized local non-
 governmental organization (NGO) devoted to human rights. Its head office is in
 Sanaa with branches in seven other cities. It was founded by the Government, and
 some experts have viewed some of its findings as not objective. The head of the or-
 ganization is president of the Sanaa Court of Appeals and is a strong government
 supporter. In September the YHRO co-sponsored, along with the Taiz-based Human
 Rights Information and Training center and the Tunis-based Arab Institute for
 Human Rights, a training workshop in Sana'a.
 Another group, the Yemeni Organization for the Defense of Liberties and Human
 Rights, is based in Aden. It was less active than in the past because of a lack of
 funds.
 Several new NGO's devoted to human rights education and democratization began
 to organize. The Taiz-based Human Rights Information and Training Center held
 training workshops for some of these NGO's as well as for primary and secondary
 school teachers. It also sponsored activities in coordination with the YHRO and the
 Arab Institute for Human Rights in Tunis.
 In late December, the Cabinet approved formation of the Supreme National Com-
 mittee for Human Rights, under the chairmanship of the deputy Prime Minister and
 Foreign Minister. The Committee includes the Ministers of Legal and Parliament
 Affairs, Justice, Social Affairs, and Interior, the Attorney General; Chairman of the
 Political Security Office; and chief of the Office of Judicial Inspection. The main pur-
 pose of the council is to ensure that Yemen meets its obligations with respect to im-
 plementing the international human rights conventions. However, the Committee
 also is expected to look into specific instances of abuse.
 In late 1997, the Consultative Council formed its own human rights committee.
 This committee invited various embassies and representatives of international orga-
 nizations to present their concerns about the human rights situation in Yemen.
 A parliamentary human rights committee has investigated some reports of human
 rights abuses. It suffers from lack of official and financial support and has no au-
 thority to do anything but issue reports.
 Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the Committee to Protect Jour-
 nalists observe Yemen closely. The International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) maintains a resident representative in Yemen. The Government has given
 these groups relatively broad access to government officials, records, refugee camps,
 and prisons. The Government acknowledged some human rights abuses alleged in
 an Amnesty International report issued in March and promised to investigate them.
 However, the Government rejected other allegations in the Amnesty report.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Prior to 1994, the Constitution stated that "no discrimination shall be practiced
 due to sex, color, racial origin, language, occupation, social status, or religious be-
 liefs." However, as amended in 1994, the Constitution now states that "all citizens
 are equal in general rights and duties'. Discrimination based on race, sex, disability,
 and, to lesser extent, religion, exists.
 Women.-Although spousal abuse is reportedly common, it is generally undocu-
 mented. In Yemen's traditional society, an abused woman would be expected to take
 her complaints to a male relative (rather than the authorities), who would intercede
 on her behalf or provide her short-term sanctuary if required. Only recently has the
 press begun to investigate or report on violations of women's rights.
 Women face significant restrictions imposed by law, social custom, and religion:
 Men are permitted to take as many as our wives, though few do so for economic
 reasons. By law the minimum age of marriage is 15. However, the law is largely
 unenforced, and some girls marry as early as age 12. The law stipulates that the
 
 
 1602
 wife's "consent" is required; "consent" is defined as "silence" for previously unwed
 women and "pronouncement of consent" for divorced women. The husband and the
 wife's guardian (usually her father) sign the marriage contract; in the former south
 Yemen, the wife also signed. The practice of dowry payments is widespread, despite
 efforts to limit the size of such payments.
 The law stipulates that the wife must "obey" the husband. She must live with him
 at the place stipulated in the contract; consummate the marriage; and not leave the
 home without his consent. Husbands may divorce wives without justifying their ac-
 tion in court. Women theoretically also have the legal right to divorce. However, in
 practice women divorce only when their husbands have failed to provide for them.
 Following a divorce, the family home and any children older than a certain age are
 often awarded to the husband. The divorced woman usually returns to her father's
 home, or to the home of another male relative. Her former husband must continue
 to support her for another 3 months, since she cannot remarry until she proves that
 she is not pregnant.
 Women seeking to travel abroad must obtain permission to receive a passport and
 to travel from their husbands or fathers and are expected to be accompanied by
 male relatives. However, this rule is not universally applied.
 Islamic law permits a Muslim man to marry a Christian or Jewish woman, but
 no Muslim woman may marry outside of Islam. Married women do not have the
 right to confer citizenship on their foreign-born spouses; they may, however, confer
 citizenship on children born in Yemen of-foreign-born fathers.
 An estimated 80 percent of women are illiterate, compared with approximately 35
 percent of men. The fertility rate is 7.5 children per woman. Most women have no
 access to basic health care. Even where clinics are available, many women do not
 use them because their male relatives, or they themselves, refuse to allow a male
 doctor to examine them.
 In general, women in the south are better educated and have had somewhat
 greater employment opportunities than their northern counterparts. Since the 1994
 civil war, however, the number of working women in the south appears to have de-
 clined, in part due to the stagnant economy, but also because of increasing cultural
 pressure from the north.
 A Government-sponsored women's association promotes female education and
 civic responsibilities, and a NGO also has been established for the same purpose.
 Several women's groups are in the process of forming and registering with the Gov-
 ernment.
 Children.-While the Government has asserted its commitment to protecting chil-
 dren's rights, it lacks the resources necessary to ensure adequate health care, edu-
 cation, and welfare services for children. The U.N. Development Program estimates
 that 30 percent of children are malnourished. The infant mortality rate is 106
 deaths per 1000 births.
 The law provides for universal free education for 9 years, but this provision is not
 enforced. Many children, especially girls, do not attend primary school. Some rural
 areas have no schools for their schoo-age population.
 Child marriage is common, especially in rural areas. Although the law requires
 that a girl be 15 years old to marry, it is not enforced. Marriages of 12-year-old girls
 are not unusual.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is practiced
 by some Yemenis, including those of African origin, living mainly in the -Red Sea
 coastal areas. It is rarely reported among the Shaf'ai religious sect, and adherents
 of the Zaydi sect reputedly do not practice it at all. According to a 1992 report is-
 sued by a European researcher, the practice is "prevalent" in Tihama province in
 southwest Yemen, "widely reported" for the Hadramaut area along the southern
 coast, "spotty" elsewhere, and "totally absent" from the inland highlands and desert
 areas. The European report describes the procedure in Yemen as mainly confined
 to excision, with infibulation being practiced only among east African immigrants
 and refugees. While some government health workers actively and publicly discour-
 age the practice, the Government has not passed legislation to outlaw it, nor have
 women s groups adop ted the problem as a major concern.
 People With Disailities.-There are distinct social prejudices against persons
 with mental and physical disabilities. The disabled often face discrimination in edu-
 cation and employment. The Government has not enacted legislation or otherwise
 mandated accessibility for the disabled, nor provided special clinics or schools for
 them. Many disabled persons are reduced to begging in order to support themselves.
 Mentally ill patients, particularly those who commit crimes, are imprisoned and
 even shackled when there is no one to care for them. Since 1995, the ICRC, in co-
 operation with the Yemeni Red Crescent Society, has constructed and staffed sepa-
 
 
 1603
 rate detention facilities for mentally disabled prisoners. These new facilities are lo-
 cated in Sanaa, Ibb, and Taiz, and collectively can care for a population of 300 per-
 sons.
 Religious Minorities.-Apart from a small but undetermined number of Christians
 and Imdus in Aden, and a few Baha'is in the north, Jews are the only indigenous
 religious minority. Their numbers have diminished significantly due to voluntary
 emigration. Although the law makes no distinction, Jews are traditionally restricted
 to living in one section of a city or village and are often confined to a limited choice
 of employment, usually farming or handicrafts. Jews may, and do, own real prop-
 ert.
 Crstian clergy who minister to the foreign community are employed in teaching,
 social services, and health care.
 A hospital in Jibla operated by the Baptist Church in the past experienced occa-
 sional threats and harassment from local Islamic extremists who feared that the
 hospital might be used to spread Christianity. There were no reports of harassment
 against thehospital in 1997.
 National /RaciallEthnic Minorities.-Yemenis with a non-Yemeni parent, called
 "Muwalladin', may face discrimination in employment and in other areas. Persons
 seeking employent at Sanaa University or admission to the military academy
 must by law demonstrate that they have two Yemeni parents. Nonetheless, many
 senior government officials, including Members of Parliament and ministers, have
 only one Yemeni parent. In some cases, naturalization of the non-Yemeni parent is
 sufficient to overcome the "two-Yemeni parent" requirement.
 A small group of persons claiming to be the descendants of ancient Ethiopian oc-
 cupiers of Yemen, who were later enslaved, are considered the lowest social class.
 Known as the "akhdam" (servants), they live in squalor and endure persistent social
 discrimination.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides that citizens have the
 right to form unions. A 1995 labor law governs labor relations. Workers have the
 right to strike. The law provides equal labor rights for women, and it renews the
 freedom of workers to associate. The Labor Law does not stipulate a minimum
 membership for unions, nor does it limit them to a specific enterprise or firm. Thus,
 citizens may now associate by profession or trade.
 The Yemeni Confederation of Labor Unions (YCLU) remains the sole national um-
 brella organization. The YCLU claims 350,000 members in 15 unions and denies
 any association with the Government, although it works closely with the Govern-
 ment to resolve labor disputes through negotiation. Observers suggest that the Gov-
 ernment likely would not tolerate the establishment of an alternative labor federa-
 tion unless it believed it to be in its best interests.
 By law, civil servants and public sector workers, and some categories of farm
 workers, may not join unions. Only the General Assembly of the Yemeni Confed-
 eration of Labor Unions may dissolve unions.
 In 1997 there were two brief strikes by pilots and ground personnel of Yemenia,
 the national airline.
 The YCLU is affiliated with the Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and the for-
 merly Soviet-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The 1996 Labor Law provides
 workers with the right to organize and bargain collectively. All collective bargaining
 agreements must be deposited with and reviewed by the Ministry of Labor; such
 agreements exist. Unions may negotiate wage settlements for their members and
 can resort to strikes or other actions to achieve their demands.
 The law protects employees from antiunion discrimination, employers do not have
 the right to dismiss an employee for union activities. Employees may appeal cases
 of antiunion discrimination to the ministry of labor. Employees may also take a case
 to the labor courts, which are often favorably disposed toward workers especially if
 the employer is a foreign company.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor. There were no reports of its practice. The law does not specifi-
 cally prohibit forced or bonded labor by children, but such practices are not known
 to occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Child
 labor is common, especially in rural areas. Many children are compelled to work in
 subsistence farming by virtue of the substandard economic situations of their fami-
 lies. Even in urban areas, children may be observed working in stores and work-
 shops, selling goods on the streets, and begging. The law does not specifically pro-
 
 
 1604
 hibit forced or bonded labor by children, but such practices are not known to occur
 (see Section 6.c.).
 The established minimum age for employment is 15 in the private sector and 18
 in the public sector. By special permit, children between the ages of 12 and 15 may
 work. The Government rarely enforces these provisions, especially in rural and re-
 mote areas. The Government also does not enforce the laws regarding compulsory
 education for children, and the likelihood that many school-age children are working
 instead of attending school is high.
 According to a 1994 survey undertaken by the Ministry of Labor, the number of
 children (between the ages 10 and 14) engaged in work was more than 79,000 boys
 and 35,000 girls. Experts believe that the number has grown substantially since the
 survey was taken.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no established minimum wage for any
 type of employment in Yemen. The Labor Law states that "it shall not be permis-
 sible that the minimal level of the wage of a worker should be less than the minimal
 level of wages of government civil servants.?
 According to the Ministry of Labor, the average minimum wage of civil servants
 for 1994-1995 was approximately $45 to $53 (6,000-7,000 rials) per month. Private
 sector workers, especially skilled technicians, do far better. A combination of infla-
 tion, the loss of government-provided subsidies, and an erosion in the exchange
 value of the national currency has substantially eroded wages during the past few
 years.
 The law specifies a 40-hour workweek with a maximum 8-hour workday, but
 many workshops and stores operate 10- to 12-hour shifts without penalty. The work-
 week for government employees is 35 hours, 6 hours per day Saturday through
 Wednesday, and 5 hours on Thursday.
 Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations and
 can challenge dismissals in court. The Ministry of Labor has the responsibility for
 regulating workplace health and safety conditions. However, according to an August
 newspaper interview given by a senior official in the Ministry of Labor, the requisite
 legislation for regulating occupational health is nonexistent. The official reported
 that many workers regularly are exposed to toxic industrial products. Some foreigu-
 owned companies implement higher health, safety, and environmental standards
 than the Government requires.
