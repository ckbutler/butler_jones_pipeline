 ,ERELAND-
 Ireland is a parliamentary- deniocracy with a long tradition of orderly transfer of
 power. The government consists of an executive branch headed by a Prime Minister,
 a legislative branch with a bicameral Parliarment, and an independent-judiciary. The
 President is directly elected.
 The national police are under the effective civilian control of the Minister of Jus-
 tice and have sole responsibility for internal security. Ireland's principal internal se-
 curity concern has been to prevent the spillover of terrorist violence from Northern
 Ireland. With the signing of the Belfast Peace Agreement on April 14, virtually all
 parties in Northern Ireland acknowledged the goals-of democracy, peace, and rec-
 onciliation. All -paramilitary groups, on both gides of the border, have declared per-
 manent cease-fires, with the exception of the Continuity Irish Republican Army.
 Ireland has an open, market-based economy that is highly dependent on inter-
 national trade. It is a large net recipient of funds from the European Union '(EU)
 designed to raise per-capita gross national product to the EU average. Strong eco-
 nomic growth over the past few years has lowered unemployment to 7.2 percent, the
 lowest in 30 years.
 The Government generally 'respected the human -rights of its citizens. Human
 rights ,problems arise primarily from: Prison overcrowding and substaAdard facili-
 ties; instances of abuse by police and prison officials;'the continuation of special ar-
 rest and detention authority and the ionjury court; 'violence and discrimination
 against women; the abuse of children, the occasional censorship of films, books, and
 periodicals; and discrimination against asylum seekers and Travellers (an itinerant
 ethnic community).
 As stipulated in the Belfast Peace Agreement, the Government plans to establish
 an independent human rights commission in 1999, which is to cooperate with a par-
 allel commission to be set up in Northein Ireland. The human rights commissions
 is to provide information and promote awareness of human rights,: comment on
 human rights draft legislation referred to them by the legislatures, make rec-
 ommendations to the governments on the adequacy and effectiveness of laws and
 practices, and initiate court proceedings or provide assistance to individuals doing
 SO.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the'Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and security personnel generally did not employ
 them.

 While the mistreatment of persons in police custody is not widespread, a number
 of cases have been filed by detainees claiming damages for injuries sustained while
 in police custody. No action had been taken by year's end in the case of two persons
 held in connection with the murder of a police officer in 1996 who'alleged that they
 had been severely beaten while in police custody and who appeared in court with
 physical injuries consistent with their allegations (see Section 4). Human rights or-
 ganizations have called for the establishment of an independent ombudsman or au-
 thority to investigate complaints against the police. It would replace the current
 statutory board, the Garda (Police) Complaints Board, through which Garda au-
 thorities internally investigate alleged misconduct by their peers.
 Ireland has a low incarceration rate (76 inmates per 100,000 population), and the
 prison regime is generally liberal. However, the physical infrastructure of many
 prisons is barely adequate: a number of facilities are plagued by chronic overcrowd-
 ing, requiring doubling-up in many single-person cells. Many of the country's 14
 prisons are very old buildings, and many cells do not have toilets or running water.
 There are no adequate hospitals on prison grounds; mental health services for pris-
 oners also are inadequate. The Government was in the process of upgrading prison
 facilities to improve sanitary conditions and to meet statutory health and safety
 standards. Under the prison building program, almost 700 new cells had been built
 by year's end, including a new women's prison annex at Mountjoy Prison. A new
 400-prisoner facility at Portlaoise also is being'planned.
 According to the Justice Department, there was one case during the year in which
 legal proceedings were instituted by a prisoner who alleged mistreatment by prison
 staff and four in which prisoners alleged negligence of health. and safety as a con-
 sequence of prison conditions. In two of the latter cases the court did not find in
 favor of the prisoners inquestion, and the other two cases were pending at year's
 end. Prisoners with complaints of this'nature have ready access.to the courts for
 redress.
 The Government continued to arrest and incarcerate at Portlaoise prison persons
 involved in paramilitary activity. Conditions for these inmates are the same, if not
 better, than those for the general prison population.
 Domestic and international human rights monitors are permitted to visit prisons
 without reservation. The Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Tor-
 ture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) visited prisons in
 September and is to present its report to the Government in 1999.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exil.-The Constitution stipulates that no per-
 son shall be deprived of personal liberty without due process under the law. A de-
 tainee has the right to petition the High Court, which is required to order release
 unless it can be shown that the person is being detained in accordance with the law.
 The Criminal Justice Act of 1984 provides for an initial period of detention of 6
 hours, with an extension of another 6 hours when a police officer of the xank of su-
 perintendent or above so directs, in cases in which there are grounds for believing
 that such detention is necessary for the proper investigation of an offense. Another
 extension of 8 hours overnight is possible, to allow a detainee to sleep.
 In cases covered by the 1939 Offenses Against the State Act, the initial period
 of detention without charge is 24 hours on the direction of a police superintendent;
 detention can be extendeanother 24 hours. This act allows police to arrest and de-
 tain for questioning anyone suspected of committing a "scheduled offense," i.e., one
 involving firearms, explosives, or membership in an unlawful organization. Although
 the stated purpose of the act is to "prevent actions and conduct calculated to under-
 mine public order and the aulthority of the state," it is not restricted to subversive
 offenses. Therefore, the police have broad arrest and detention powers in any case
 involving firearms. However, under the terms of the decommissioning law enacted
 in 1997 in support of the Northern Ireland peace process, proceedings may not be
 instituted against persons in relation to any offense that may be committed in the
 course of decommissioning   h i l l   a    win accordance with an approved arms
 decommissioning scheme.
 The act also provides for the indefinite detention, or internment, without trial of
 any person who is engaged in activities that are "prejudicial to the preservation of
 public peace and order or to the security of the state." While this power has not
 been invoked since the late 1950's, the government could do so by simply issuing
 a proclamation. There are no provisions for the 1939 Offenses Against the State Act
 to be renewed; it continues indefinitely.
 An amendment to the Offenses Against the State Act of 1939 was enacted in the
 wake of the Omagh bombing in August. The amended act a      nllows poice to detain
 suspects in certain crimes, usually involving serious offenses with firearms or explo-
 sives, for 48 hours, with a possible 24-hour extension if approved by a judge.
 
 
 1310
 The legislation also curtails the right of silence. Under the amendment, if the ac-
 cused was informed of the consequences of remaining silent to questions regarding
 his whereabouts, associations, or actions, then the accused's silence may be used as
 corroboration of guilt. An accused person's failure to defend against accusations of
 membership in an illicit organization also may be used as corroboration of guilt.
 However, the accused cannot be convicted based solely on his refusal to speak.
 Membership in or leadership of an illicit organization carries a possible life sen-
 tence under the new amendment (illegal organizations are defined by the 1939 Of-
 fenses Act). The word 'of a police superintendent can be used as corroboration of
 membership. Collecting information to aid in a serious offense carries a penalty of
 up to 10 years' imprisonment or a fine. Withholding information that could prevent
 a "serious" offense or that could aid in-he apprehension or conviction of a perpetra-
 tor also is illegal, with a penalty of up to 5 years' imprisonment and a fine.
 While the amendment had yet to be used in the courts, there was concern that
 its broad powers could encourage abuse, and even its supporters refer to it as "dra-
 conian." The amended act is to expire in June 2000 without specific parliamentary
 reauthorization.
 The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act of 1996 permits the detention without
 charge for up to 7 days in cases involving drug trafficking. To hold a suspected drug
 trafficker for more than 48 hours, however, the police must seek a judge's approval.
 Following approval in 1996 of a referendum calling for stricter bail laws,.legisla-
 tion was enacted in 1997 that is designed to allow a court to refuse bail to a person
 charged with a serious offense where it is reasonably considered necessary to pre-
 vent the commission ofianother serious offense. -A schedule of serious offenses is con-
 tained in the bill;- the offense must be one that carries a penalty of 5 years' impris-
 onment or more. However, by year's end the Justice&-Minister had not signed a stat-
 utory order that would allow the courts to implement the law's-provisions. The lack
 of accommodations for prisoners was cited as the reason for the delay.
 The authorities do not impose exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides
 citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process.
 The judicial system includes a district court with 23 districts, a circuit court with
 8 circuits, the High Court,, the Court of Criminal Appeal, and the Supreme Court.
 The President appoints judges on the advice of the government.
 Criminal cases are prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions, a state offi-
 cial with independent status. Jury trial is the norm. The accused generally may
 choose an attorney. For-indigent defendants, the state assumes the cost of counsel.
 However, the Constitution explicitly allows "special courts" to be created when
 "ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and
 the preservation of public peace .and order." In 1972, under the 1939 Offenses
 Against the State Act, the Government set up a nonjury "Special Criminal Court"
 (SCC) to try "scheduled offenses" (see Section -1.d.). Largely a reaction to-the spill-
 over of paramilitary violence from Northern Ireland; the SCChas been justified over
 the years as addressing- the problem of jury intimidation in-cases-in olving defend-
 ants with suspected paramilitary links. The continued need-for the SCC is being
 kept under review by the Government.
 During the first half of 1998, the SCC indicted 24 persons and held 12 trials. For
 all of 1997-there were 26 indictments and 14 trials in. the SCC. In -addition to
 "scheduled offenses," the Director of Public Prosecutions can have any nonscheduled
 offense tried by the SCC if he believes that the ordinary courts are inadequate to
 secure the effective administration -of justice and the preservation of public peace
 and order and so certifies in writing.
 In lieu of a jury, the SCC always sits as a three-judge panel. Its verdicts are by
 majority -vote. Rules of evidence are-essentially the same as in regular courts, except
 -that the sworn statement of a'police chief superintendent identifying the accused
 as a member of an illegal organization is accepted as prima facie evidence. Sessions
 of the SCC are usually public, but theJjudge may exclude certain .persons other than
 journalists. Appeals of SCC decisions-are allowed in certain circumstances.
 There'were no reports of-political prisoners.
 People imprisoned for crimes, related to the terrorist- campaign in-Northern Ire-
 -land whose organizations have declared permanent cease-fires and committed- them-
 selves to work through peaceful, :democratic means are being released under the
 terms-of the Belfast Peace Agreement., All releases are to be-accomplished within
 2 years, although releases on a more accelerated basis were expected.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family? Home, or Correspondence.-The Su-
 preme Court has -affirmed that, although- not specifically .provided for in the Con-
 
 
 1311
 
 stitution, the inviolability of personal privacy, family, and home must be respected
 in law and practice. This ruling is fully honored by the Government.
 In 1996 the High Court upheld a referendum that removed the ban on divorce.
 The Government enacted implementing legislation allowing courts to grant divorces
 under certain circumstances.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides individuals with the
 right to "express freely their convictions and opinions.' Freedom of the press, how-
 ever, is subject to the qualification that it not "undermine public order or morality
 or the authority of the state." Publication or utterance of "blasphemous, seditious,
 or indecent matter" is prohibited. While the press in practice operates freely, the
 1961 Defamation Act (which puts the onus on newspapers and periodicals accused
 of libel to prove that defamatory words are true) .and the 1963 Official Secrets Act
 (which gives the State wide scope to prosecute unauthorized disclosures of sensitive
 government information) are believed to result in some self-censorship.
 Broadcasting remains mostly state controlled, but private sector broadcasting is
 growing. There are 21 independent radio stations, and an independent television
 station began broadcasting in September. However, expanded access to cable and
 satellite television is lessening dramatically the relative influence of state-controlled
 broadcasting. The Broadcasting Complaints Commission oversees standards and in-
 vestigates complaints about programming. The 1960 Broadcasting Act empowers the
 Government to prohibit the state-owned radio and television network from broad-
 casting any matter that is "likely to promote or incite to crime or which would tend
 to undermine the authority of the state." It was on this basis that the Government
 banned Sinn Fein (the legal political front of the'Irish Republican Army) from the
 airwaves from 1971 to 1994.
 Films and videos must be screened and classified by the Office of the Film Censor
 before they can be shown or sold. Distributors pay fees to finance the censor's office.
 Under the 1923 Censorship of Films Act, the censor has the authority to cut or ban
 any film that is "indecent, obscene or blasphemous" or which tends to "inculcate
 principles contrary to public morality or subversive of public morality." No theatrical
 fims were banned in 1998, but about 80 videos were banned by the end of Septem-
 ber, mainly because of their pornographic content. Decisions of the censor can be
 appealed to a nine-member appeal board within 3 months, but neither the censor
 nor the appeal board is required to hear arguments or evidence in public or to state
 the reasons for its decisions.
 Books and periodicals are also subject to censorship. The 1946 Censorship of Pub-
 lications Act calls for a five-member board to examine publications referred to it by
 the customs service or a member of the general public. It also can examine books
 (but not periodicals) on its own initiative. The board can prohibit the sale of any
 publication that it judges to be indecent or obscene. In 1998 the board banned 15
 books and 10 periodicals, compared with 10 books and 89 periodicals in 1997, and
 63 books and 43 periodicals in 1996.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides citi-
 zens with the right to "assemble peaceably and without arms" and to form associa-
 tions and unions. However, it also allows the State to "prevent or control meetings"
 that are calculated to cause a breach of the peace or to be a danger or nuisance
 to the general public. Under the 1939 Offenses Against the State Act, it is unlawful
 to hold any public meeting on behalf of, or in support of, an illegal organization.
 Although the Government prosecutes and incarcerates persons for mere membership
 in a terrorist organization, it allows meetings and assemblies by some groups-that
 are associated with illegal terrorist organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government does not hamper the teaching or practice of any faith. Even though Ire-
 land is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, there is no state religion. However, most
 primary and secondary schools are denominational, and their boards of management
 are partially controlled by the Catholic Church. Although religious instruction is an
 integral part of the curriculum, parents may exempt their children from such in-
 struction. There is no discrimination against nontraditional religious groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There is complete freedom of movement within the country, as well as
 freedom to engage in foreign travel, emigration, and voluntary repatriation.
 The Government approved a new refugee law in 1996, but it has been imple-
 mented only partially and is currently under review. The law put into effect the
 Dublin Convention of 1990, harmonizing European Union asylum procedures, and
 it also has made provision for program refugees (those invited by the state to apply
 
 
 1312
 
 for asylum; in 1998, mostly Bosnians and Vietnamese). The law also expressly for-
 bids the forced return of persons to a country where they fear persecution.
 Ireland implements its obligations under the 1951 United Nations (U.N.) Conven-
 tion Relating tothe Status of Refugees on an administrative basis. Specific adminis-
 trative procedures for the determination of refugee status were drawn- up in con-
 sultation with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, and in 1992 the Supreme
 Court-ruled that these procedures were binding on the Minister of Justice. However,
 as the number of asylum seekers increased (from only 31 in 1990 to over 4,000 in
 1998), these administrative procedures proved inadequate. -In particular there are
 complaints of long delays and a lack of transparency in decisions concerning refugee
 status. There is a backlog of over 6,000 asylum cases. In 1998 the Department of
 Justice upgraded its asylum division by increasing its staff and moving it into a
 larger building with more services for asylum seekers.
 The Government provided first asylum in almost 200 cases in 1998. There were
 no reports of the forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecu-
 tion. The increase in the number of asylum seekers, as well as allegations of racism
 in dealing with them and the issue of whether they should be allowed to work, led
 to a public debate on immigration (see Section 5).
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitutional requirement that parliamentary elections be held at least
 every 7 years has always been met. Suffrage is .universal for citizens over the age
 of 18, and balloting is secret. Several political parties have seats in the bicameral
 Parliament. Members of the Dail (House of Representatives)-the chamber that car-
 ries out the main legislative functions-are popularly elected; in the Seanad (Sen-
 ate), most members are elected by vocational and university groups, and the others
 are appointed by the Prime Minister. The President is popularly elected for a 7-year
 term and is limited to 2 terms. An appointed Council of State serves as an advisory
 body to the President.P
 Women are underrepresented in government and politics. Although the President
 is a woman, only 20 of the 166 deputies in the Dadt and 11 of the 60 senators are
 women. Three of the 15 government ministers are women, as are 2 of the 17 junior
 ministers. Three women sit on the 20-member High Court; only 1 of the 8 Supreme
 Court judges is a woman. While women participate inall departments of Govern-
 ment, they are underrepresented at senior levels.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The principal independent organization that monitors domestic human rights
 problems, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL), generally operates without
 hindrance from the Government. However, with regard to allegations of mistreat-
 ment of two suspects held in connection with the murder of a police officer in 1996,
 the ICCL indicated in a report issued jointly with British Irish Rights Watch in
 "1997 that its efforts to investigate these allegations did not receive the cooperation
 of the police authorities. The ICCL report said that "this incident raises serious
 questions about the attitude of the Garda (police) authorities toward bona fide
 human rights organizations investigating allegations of human rights abuses in the
 Republic of Ireland." The ICCL report requested the Irish Government to set up a
 "fully independent inquiry, headed by a judge and with high court powers to sum-
 mon and question witnesses, to investigate the treatment of persons arrested in
 Limerick following Garda McCabe's murder." The Minister of Justice told Par-
 liament in December 1997 that, while he -would not be prepared to tolerate any
 abuse of persons in custody, it would not be appropriate to take any action on the
 allegations pending completion of the murder trials, -which were scheduled for Janu-
 ary 1999.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution, as amended, forbids state promotion of one religion over an-
 other and discrimination on the grounds of religion, profession, belief, or status. In
 June an amended Employment Equality Act was passed that outlaws discrimination
 in relation to employment on thebasis of nine distinct discriminatory grounds: Gen-
 der, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability,
 race, and membership in the Traveller community. Under the act a new independ-
 ent equality authority is to replace the Employment Equality Agency. The authority
 is to be charged with a statutory duty to work towards the elimination of discrimi-
 nation and the promotion of equality of opportunity in employment on the nine dis-
 criminatory grounds covered by the act.
 
 
 1313
 
 Women.-A 1997 government task force on violence against women concluded that
 the problem, in particular domestic violence, is widespread and that many women
 believe that existing services are incapable of responding to their needs. The task
 force found that many women believe that the legal and court systems minimize the
 seriousness of crimes committed against them, fail to dispense justice, and make
 them feel at fault for what happened. The task force cited a need to compile more
 accurate and comprehensive statistics on the nature and extent of the problem, and
 issued a series of recommendations that are under government review.
 According to the Dublin Rape Crisis Center, the level of reported rapes continues
 to rise. The Center received 7,094 calls between July 1997 and June 1998 (a 30 per-
 cent increase over the same period in the previous year) and concluded that there
 was disquieting evidence that rape and sexual assaults-by their very number and
 frequency-were dulling the response of the public at large. For the 1997-98 period,
 the Center estimated that 29 percent of rape and child sexual abuse victims re-
 ported the crime to police and that 7 percent of these cases resulted in convictions,
 with 76 percent of cases still pending. Recent rape victims and victims raped by a
 stranger were more likely to have reported the rape to police. A 1990 act
 criminalized rape within marriage and provided for free legal advice to the victim.
 There are 12 women's shelters in the country, funded in part by the government,
 with accommodations for about 85 families.
 Discrimination against women in the workplace is unlawful, but inequalities per-
 sist regarding pay and promotions in both the public and the private sectors.
 Women hold about 43 percent of public sector jobs, but are underrepresented in sen-
 ior management positions. The Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act of 1974, the Employ-
 ment Equality Act of 1977, and the amended Employment Equality Act of 1998 pro-
 vide for protection and redress against discrimination based on gender and marital
 status. The Employment Equality Agency, soon to be replaced by the Equality Au-
 thority, monitors their implementation. In 1997 the hourly industrial wage for
 -women was about 70 percent of that earned by men, and the weekly earnings of
 women averaged 69 percent of the weekly pay of men.
 Working women often are hampered by the lack of adequate childcare facilities.
 The 1994 Maternity Protection Act provides a woman 14 weeks of paid maternity
 leave and the right to return to her job. In December a new Parental Leave Act en-
 tered into effect, which allows a child's mother and father each to take 14 weeks
 of unpaid leave to care for a child under the age of 5. Although each parent has
 a separate entitlement to parental leave, the leave is not transferable, i.e., the moth-
 er cannot take the father's leave or vice versa. Parental leave does not affect a
 mother's right to maternity leave.
 Children.-The Government is committed to the welfare and rights of children,
 as demonstrated by its ongoing implementation of the 1991 Child Care Act. Edu-
 cation is compulsory for children from 6 to 15 years of age. Among other things, the
 act places a statutory duty on government health boards to identify and help chil-
 dren who are not receiving adequate care and gives the police increased powers to
 remove children from the family when there is an immediate and serious risk to
 their health or welfare. The Minister of State (junior minister) for Health has spe-
 cial responsibility for children's policy, including monitoring the implementation of
 the Child Care Act by the eight regional health boards. The 1987 Status of Children
 Act provided for equal rights for children in all legal proceedings.  -
 The sexual abuse of children continued to receive significant media attention. The
 Dublin Rape Crisis Center reported that 57 percent of contacts with its crisis line
 involved adults disclosing child sexual abuse during their youth. The new Child
 Trafficking and Pornography Act, which was passed in June, strengthens and up-
 dates measures to protect children -from sexualexploitation, including any exchange
 of information on the Internet that implies a child is available for sex However, the
 Government by year's end had not enacted a requirement for the mandatory report-
 ing of child abuse cases by health and social 'workers.
 People With Disabilities.-The government Commission on the Status of People
 with Disabilities issued a report in 1996, following a 3-year study, with 402 rec-
 ommendations. The Commission estimated that 10 percent of the population have
 a disability. Under the Employment Equality Act of 1998, it is unlawful to discrimi-
 nate against anyone on the basis of disability in relation to employment. The Build-
 ing Regulations Act of 1991 established minimum criteria to ensure access for peo-
 ple with disabilities to all public and private buildings constructed or significantly
 altered after 1992, but enforcement is uneven.
 National/RaciallEthnic Minorities.-There are some 25,000 nomadic persons who
 regard themselves as a distinct ethnic group called "Travellers," roughly analogous
 to the Roma of continental Europe. The "travelling" community has its own history,
 
 
 1314
 culture, and. language. The Travellers' emphasis on self-employment and the ex-
 tended family distinguishes them from the rest of society.
 Travellers are regularly denied access to premises, goods, facilities, and services;
 many restaurants and pubs, for example, will not serve them. Despite national
 school rules that provide that no child may be refused admission on account of social
 position, Travellers frequently experience difficulties in enrolling their children in
 school. Sometimes they are segregated into all-Traveller classes. Of an estimated
 4,000 Traveller families, about 1,000 live on roadsides or on temporary sites without
 toilets, electricity, or washing facilities. Many Travellers are dependent on social
 welfare for survival and are unable to access the mainstream economy because of
 discrimination and a lack of education.
 The Employment Equality Act of 1998 outlaws job discrimination against Travel-
 lers. A task force on the travelling community was established in 1993 and produced
 a comprehensive report in 1995 on various aspects of Travellers' lives, including
 education, work, accommodation, health,-and discrimination. A monitoring commit-
 tee is overseeing implementation of the recommendations of thexeport.
 The influx of -sylum seekers, some of whom were migrating for economic reasons,
 led to.-a public .debate over how open Irish society is to new immigrants and trig-
 gered isolated racist incidents. A 1997 European Union poll found that 55 percent
 of Irish citizens considered themselves, racist
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The.right to join a union is provided for by law, as
 is the right to refrain from joining. About 50 percent ofworkers in the private and
 public sectors are-members of unions. Police and military personnel are prohibited
 from striking,.but they may form associations to represent themselves in matters
 of pay, working conditions, and general welfare. The right to strike is freely exer-
 cised in both the public and private sectors. The Industrial, Relations Act of 1990
 prohibits retribution against strikers and union leaders; the Government effectively
 enforces this.provision through the Department of-Enterprise, Trade, and Employ-
 ment. In 1997-the number of industrial disputes and the number of workdays lost
 by strikes declined from 1996. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) rep-
 resents 64 unions in the Republic of.Ireland and Northern Ireland. The ICTU is
 independent of the government and of the political parties. Unions may freely form
 or join federations or confederations and affiliate with international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Labor unions have full free-
 dom to organize and.to engage in collective bargainmng. The Anti-Discrimination
 (Pay) Act of 1974 and the Employment Equality Act of 1977 make the Employment
 Equality Agency responsible for oversight of allegations of antiunion discrimination.
 If the Agency is unable to effect resolution, the dispute goes before the Labor Court,
 which consists of one representative each for the employer and the union, plus an
 independent chairperson. The Unfair Dismissals -Act of 1977 provides various forms
 of relief in cases of employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination, including the
 reinstatement of workers fired for union activities.
 Most terms and conditions of employment are determined through collective bar-
 gaining, in the context of a national economic pact negotiated every 3 years by the
 "social partners," i.e., representatives of unions, employers, farmers, and the govern-
 ment. A 3-year agreement negotiated -among the social partners in 1996, entitled
 "Partnership 2000," remains in effect.
 The Industrial Relations Act- of 1990 established the Labor Relations Commission,
 which provides advice and conciliationvservices in industrial disputes. The Commis-
 sion may refer unresolved disputes to- the Labor Court, which may recommend
 terms of settlement and-myset up joint~employer-union committees to regulate
 conditions of employment-and minimum wages in a specific trade or industry.
 There is an export processing zone at Shannon Airport with the same labor laws
 as the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced and bonded labor, includ-
 ing that performed by children, is prohibited by law and does not occur.
 - d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-By law
 children are required to attend school through the age of 15. Under the terms of
 the Protection of Young Persons Act, which took effect in 1997, employers may not
 employ those under the age of 16 in a regular full-time job. Employers may hire
 14- or 15-year-olds for light work on school holidays, as part of an approved work
 experience or educational program, or on a part-time basis during the school year
 .(for children over the age of 15 only). -The act gives effect to international rules on
 the protection of young workers drawn up by the International Labor Organization
 and the EU; it sets rest intervals and maximum working hours, prohibits the em-
 ployment of 18-year-olds for late night work, and requires employers to keep speci-

 fled records for their workers who are under 18 years of age. The law prohibits
 forced and bonded child labor, and the Government enforces this prohibition effec-
 tively (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no general minimum wage law, but
 there are several minimum rates of pay applicable to specific industrial sectors,
 mainly those with lower-than-average wages. Although the lowest of these minimum
 wages is not sufficient to provide a decent living for a family of four, low-income
 families are entitled to additional benefits such as subsidized housing and children's
 allowances.
 The standard workweek is 39 hours. Working hours in the industrial sector are
 limited to 9 hours per day and 48 hours per week. Overtime work is limited to 2
 hours per day, 12 hours per week, and 240 hours in a year. The Department of En-
 terprise, Trade, and Employment is responsible for enforcing four basic laws dealing
 with occupational safety that provide adequate and comprehensive coverage. No sig-
 nificant complaints arose from either labor or management regarding enforcement
 of these laws. Recent regulations provide that employees who find themselves in sit-
 uations that present a "serious, imminent and unavoidable risk" may leave without
 the employer being able to take disciplinary action.
