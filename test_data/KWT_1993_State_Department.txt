 KUWAIT
 Kuwait's rulers (Amirs), drawn from the A-Sabah family, have governed the
 country in consultation with prominent commercial families and other community
 leaders for over 200 years. The 1962 Constitution provides for an elected National
 Assembly and details the powers of the Government and the rights of citizens. Al-
 though the Constitutionpermits the Amir to suspend its articles only during a pe-
 od of martial law, the Amir has twice (from 1976 to 1981 and from 1986 to 1992)
 suspended constitutional previsions by decree and ruled extraconstitutionally. The
 October 1992 Assembly elections and the subsequent convening of the Assembly
 marked a return to parliamentary life. During 1993 the Assembly assumed an ac-
 tive role, enacting legislation, including the national budget. (See Section 3 for fur-
 ther details on the ree of the Assembly)
 The Ministry of Interior supervises Kuwait's security apparatus, including the
 Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and Kuwait State Security (KSS), two
 agencies that investigate internal security-related offenses. Kuwait's security forces
 continued to eommit human rights abuses, particularly in their treatment of those
 peoples whose leaders were associated with suo pport or iraq s invasion of Kuwait
 (Irais, Jordananns, Palestinians, Yemenis, and Sudanese).
 Endowed with rich oil resources, Kuwait's market economy made substantial
 progress in recovering from the destruction caused by the Iraqi occupation. By 1993
 Kuwait had an estimated per capita income of apprximately $17,234. Reconstruc-
 
 
 1224
 tion was largely complete; however, heavy costs accompanied the recovery. Over the
 past 3 fiscal years, Kuwait incurred a cumulative fiscal deficit of approximately $63
 billion, a deficit that it covered by drawing down its foreign assets by half and in-
 creasing its public debt. Despite the emphasis the Government places on an open
 market economy, foreign nationals may not own property or majority shares in sig-
 nificant local businesses and are subject to restrictive labor laws. In addition, the
 Government has ownership interests in most of the major banks and in many busi-
 nesses, chiefly in the oil industry.
 Although Kuwait showed some progress in human rights in 1993, its overall
 human rights record was mixed. The Government relaxed its residency restrictions
 on Gazans, made it easier for foreign workers to sponsor their family members,
 agreed to begin investigating the cases of long-term detainees, and closed illegal re-
 cruitment agencies for domestic servants. The Human Rights Committee of the Na-
 tional Assembly and the press publicized important human rights issues, raising
 awareness of such issues at both the official and popular level.
 Nevertheless, serious human rights problems remained. There were continuing re-
 ports of torture and of arbitrary arrest, as well as limitations on the freedoms of
 assembly and association and women's rights. Political parties remain banned, and
 citizens do not enjoy the right to change the head of state and government. The Gov-
 er.inent banned all unlicensed nongovernmental organizations in August, thereby
 eliminating some organizations that had been engaged in human rights work. The
 Government continued to refuse to readmit stateless, Iraqi, and Palestinian individ-
 uals who had strong family ties to Kuwait, and Kuwaiti labor laws continued to ex-
 clude domestic servants from their protective provisions.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-In August the body of a young Iraqi
 was discovered on the Kuwaiti side of the Kuwaiti-Iraqi border. The Iraqi reportedly
 died from intracranial bleeding and pressure resulting from a large depressed frac-
 ture of the skull, and the body showed clear signs of severe abuse and torture. Pre-
 liminary investigations indicated that the youth, along with three companions, had
 been apprehended by Kuwaiti police while attempting to infiltrate across the border.
 All four were tortured and suljected to severe abuse before being released near the
 border a few days later. During the preliminary investigations, Kuwaiti police de-
 nied any involvement in the incident and suggested that the perpetrators were
 Iraqis.
 In January a Kuwaiti criminal court convicted three police officers in connection
 with the death of a Sri Lankan in 1992 and sentenced them each to 5 years in jail
 with hard labor. The Court of Higher Appeal subsequently reduced the sentences
 to 2-year suspended sentences following the payment of "blood money" to the
 deceased's father.
 The Government reiterated that it was continuing to investigate the extrajudicial
 killings that occurred during the chaotic period after Kuwait's liberation in 1991.
 Most of the killings and disappearances, however, remain unresolved. Only one al-
 leged perpetrator is known to have been arrested, prosecuted, and convicted. The
 defendant, a former police investigator, was sentenced to life imprisonment for the
 murder of two members and attempted murder of another member of a Lebanese
 family resident in Kuwait.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reported cases of permanent disappearances,
 but there were credible reports of foreigners (particularly those peoples whose lead-
 ers were associated with support for Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait) being taken from
 their homes by unidentified Kuwaitis, held for a few hours, and then released as
 a tactic of harassment.
 Numerous disappearances followed Kuwait's liberation in 1991 as elements of the
 military and vigante groups sought retribution against persons, particularly for-
 eignei, whom they suspected of being pro-Iraqi.
 While there is no reliable estimate of the total number of disappearances, over
 100 cases remained unresolved in 1993. In additional cases where persons are
 known to be dead, law enforcement officials have failed to identify or indict sus-
 pects.
 According to the latest and most accurate figures provided to Iraq by the Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), 609 Kuwaitis and residents of Kuwait,
 including 9 women, were taken prisoner by Iraqi authorities during the occupation
 and are still missing or detained in Iraq. The Government of Iraq has refused to
 comply with U.N. Security Council Resolution 687, which provides for the detainees'
 
 
 1225
 release. Iraq denies that it holds Kuwaiti detainees and refuses to account for miss-
 ing Kuwaitis taken into Iraqi custody during the occupation.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Article 31 of the Constitution specifically prohibits the use of torture, but cases of
 serious abuse or torture continued to be reported, although far fewer such cases
 were reported in 1993 than in 1992.
 There were credible reports of abuse in Kuwaiti detention facilities, especially at
 the KSS facility. Reported abuses included blindfolding detainees, verbal abuse, and
 some physical abuse, particularly beating detainees on the soles of their feet and
 burning detainees with cigarettes. In some cases detainees were slapped, kicked, or
 shoved against walls. In one instance, Kuwaiti police and KSS personnel beat and
 used electrical shocks to torture a Kuwaiti man. The Human Rights Committee of
 the National Assembly obtained his relea-e, forced the officers involved to resign,
 and secured financial compensation for the man.
 The ICRC has access to all places of detention in Kuwait. The Government claims
 to have responded to specific allegations of abuse by investigating them and punish-
 ing at least some of the offenders. However, because it has not been willing to pro-
 vide details concerning the types of abuse and the punishment meted out, it is not
 possible to determine the likely deterrent effect, if any, of such action.
 There were also credible reports of abuse of Iraqi infiltrators arrested while at-
 temnpting to crss the Kuwaiti-Iraqi border (see Section l.a.). Specifically, there were
 credible reports of Kuwaiti security personnel beating infiltrators and suspending
 them from the ceiling for extended periods of time. To date, the Government has
 not conducted an effective investigation into these reports.
 Evidence of mistreatment during interrogation may be submitted to Kuwaiti
 courts, and confessions or other evidence obtained through torture are excludable.
 However, a number of sentences handed down by the 1991 martial law courts were
 based on confessions apparently obtained under torture. In State Security Court
 trials, including the trial of the 14 men accused of attempting to assassinate former
 President Bush during his April 1993 visit to Kuwait, defense lawyers occasionally
 sought exclusion of confessions on the basis of torture. In the latter case, following
 a court-ordered medical investigation, the judge ruled against excluding the confes-
 sions.
 While prison conditions do not threaten life, they do frequently threaten health.
 In addition to experiencing the physical mistreatment described above, prisoners
 also often must live in severely overcrowded rooms averaging as little as 1 square
 meter per person.
 Prison officials rarely release prisoners with severe medical problems and sani-
 tary conditions are such that a communicable disease would spread easify through-
 out the entire prison. Maintenance of toilets and showers is poor, frequently result-
 ing in one shower or toilet being shared by up to 100 people. Maintenance of air
 conditioning is also inadequate-detainees at the main deportation center went
 without air conditioning and cold water for the entire summer, often experiencing
 temperatures above 125 degrees Fahrenheit. Prisoners may, however, exercise out-
 side and receive visits by their family members. The ICRC monitors prison condi-
 tions.
 In June seven Iraqi detainees at the main deportation center went on a brief hun-
 ger strike to protest detention conditions. They sewed their lips together but contin-
 ued to drink and take nourishment. The Human Rights Committee of the National
 Assembly investigated conditions at the deportation center and presented a list of
 recommended improvements to the Minister of Interior. Several of the recommended
 changes were made, including provision of better medical care at the deportation
 center.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Article 31 of the Constitution prohibits
 arbitrary arrest and detention, but this prohibition is not always honored in prac-
 tice. Althoughto a leaser degree than in 1992, there were continuing credible re-
 ports of arbitrary arrests in 1993, especially of persons picked up at police check-
 points around Kuwait City. Foreign nationals from Yemen, Sudan, Jordan, and Iraq
 as well as Palestinians were especially subject to harassment and arrest at these
 checkpoints, as were other people without valid Kuwaiti residency visas.
 Arrest warrants are required, but in misdemeanors the arresting officer may issue
 them. Prosecutorial arrest warrants are used in felony cases. Prosecutors are inde-
 pendent of the Ministry of Interior. A review of the legality of detention is not re-
 quired, but will be granted upon request. A functioning system of bail exists.
 The Kuwaiti Penal Code employs two different standards: one for criminal cases
 and one for cases involving state security. In all cases, a detainee may not be held
 for more than 4 days without charge, but in practice that requirement has occasion-
 ally been ignored in cases involving the KSS. In cases not involving the KSS, the
 
 
 1226
 suspect must either be released or charged by a prosecutor, who may authorize de-
 tention for an additional 21 days. A judge may authorize further detention pending
 trial.
 Detention rules are different for cases involving state security. In July 1991, the
 Government amended the State Security Law to limit to 6 months the period of de-
 tention that a prosecutor may authorize. A judge may authorize longer detentions
 pending trial. A defendant may appal the detention order to the State Security
 Court after 21 days in detention. If the appal is rejected, the defendant may appeal
 again 30 days after the rejection. The Government, especially the KSS, occasionally
 prevents families from visiting detainees during the first 4 days while they are
 being interrogated. After that, families are allowed to visit the detainees. There does
 not appear to be any long-term incommunicado detention. On average, detainees
 wait between 20 and 30 days for their trials to begin.
 Approximately 650 persons remained in detention as of October, including those
 who had been convicted in either the State Security or the martial law courts, a
 decrease of 30 percent since 1992. Approximately 75 percent of these persons were
 detained under administrative deportation orders, which may be issued arbitrarily
 and which provide no judicial recourse. Around 10 percent of these persons, espe-
 cially Iraqis or bidoon (stateless residents of Kuwait), had been in detention for
 more than 1 year. Cases against many of the people under administrative deporta-
 tion orders are apparently not strong enough to take to trial, but the Government
 is unwilling to free them. The Government will not deport them to Iraq against
 their will; the prisoners have nowhere else to go. Until March of 1993, approxi-
 mately 30 releases per month took place; after March the number dropped to ap-
 proximately 5 releases per month.
 Under Kuwaiti law, no Kuwaiti may be exiled. Before the invasion, however, there
 were a few credible reports of the Government evading this law by revoking citizen-
 ship and then deporting the "non-Kuwaiti" individual. There have been no reports
 of revocations of citizenship in the postinvasion period.
 Noncitizens, even long-term residents, may be expelled without charge or judicial
 recourse if deemed "troublemakers" or 'security risks." In addition, foreign nationals
 may be expelled if they are unable to obtain work or residency permits. During 1993
 the Kuwaitis deported approximately 300 detainees and approximately 250 family
 members of Palestinians, Yemenis, Sudanese, Jordanians, and Iraqis, a marked de-
 crease from the 1992 figures of approximately 1,250 detainees and 2,000 family
 members deported. The ICRC monitors deportations only of the above-mentioned
 protected persons, but the Government also deports Iranians and other foreign na-
 tionals, including Americans and other Westerners who have violated residency re-
 quirements or committed other offenses.
 Government policies pressured Palestinians and nationals from Iraq, Yemen,
 Sudan, and Jordan to leave Kuwait and made it difficult for foreigners in general
 to sponsor their family members' entry into the country. The Government's actions
 reflected a deliberate policy aimed at changing the demographic balance to reduce
 Kuwait's overall reliance on foreign workers, particularly on nationals from coun-
 tries considered hostile to Kuwait.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Triai.-Kuwait's judicial system comprises the regular
 courts, the State Security Court, the Court of Cassation, and the military courts,
 which have jurisdiction only over offenses committed by members of the armed or
 security forces, except during periods of martial law. Both Sunni and Shi'a courts
 exist for family law cases.
 The Constitution guarantees the independence of the judiciary and states that
 "judges shall not be subject to any authority." While Kuwait's judicial system is
 nominally independent, the executive branch controls its administrative and finan-
 cial matters. In most recent cases, the courts have provided for fair public trials and
 the right of appeal. The Amir appoints judges in the regular courts on the rec-
 ommendation of the Justice Ministry. Kuwaiti nationals who serve as judges usually
 receive lifetime appointments, while many non-Kuwaiti judges serve renewable 1-
 to 3-year contracts. The Justice Ministry may remove judges for cause, but rarely
 does so. There have been credible allegations by non-Kuwaitis of instances of pro-
 Kuwaiti bias in commercial disputes before the courts involving a Kuwaiti and a
 non-Kuwaiti.
 Trials are public unless the judge holds a session in his chambers, a move com-
 monly made in cases involving sexual assault. The Constitution states that "sittings
 of the court shall be public save in the exceptional cases prescribed by law." Ses-
 sions of the State Security Court, including trials of the defendants in the Bush as-
 sassination attempt and collaborator trials, were open to the public. Defendants
 have the right to be present at all trial sessions.
 
 
 1227
 By law, all defendants in felony cases must be represented by attorneys, court-
 apeointed if necessary. In misdemeanor cases, defined as crimes punishable by less
 than 3 years' imprisonment legal counsel is optional at the discretion of the defend-
 ant, butthe court does not have to appoint a defense attorney if the accused cannot
 afford one. In cases tried by the State Security Court, the Court must notify the
 defendant of his trial date at least 10 days in advance. In cases tried by the criminal
 courts, no requirement of advance notice exists. In both systems, however, lawyers
 may request a delay on the basis of not having had sufficient time and access to
 their clients in advance of trial. Such a delay was requested by and granted to de-
 fense lawyers in the trial of the suspects charged with attempting to assassinate
 former President Bush.
 Defendants may confront witnesses and present witnesses and evidence. Defend-
 ants and their attorneys have the right to view all accusatory material used against
 them and must be notified of all prosecution witnesses in advance. The Constitution
 states that "an accused person is presumed innocent until proved guilty in a legal
 trial at which the necessary guarantees for the exercise of the right of defense are
 secured. Defendants tried and convicted in absentia have the right to appeal. Both
 defendants and prosecutors may appeal verdicts of the State Security Court to the
 Court of Cassation. The Court of Casation may conduct a limited, formal review
 of cases to determine whether the law was properly apiplied in each sentence. In
 criminal cases not involving state security, a broader right of appeal is available
 through the High Court of Appeal. Regarding the case of 10 Palestinians who were
 sentenced to death by the State Security Court in June, international human rights
 groups have expressed concern about due process shortcomings, including restric-
 tions on the right of appeal and the lengthy periods of pretrial detention.
 In 1991 the Governmentprosecuted 74 cases involving 164 defendants in martial
 law courts. These trials didno  nerally meet internationally accepted standards
 of due process, but the Government has resisted international pressure to conduct
 retrials or allow appeals.
 Under the Constitution, the Amir has the power to pardon and commute all sen-
 tences.
 There are no groups (includin# women) who are barred from testifying or whose
 testimony is given lesser weight in Kuwait's secular courts. The Islamic courts how-
 ever, follow Islamic law, which states that the testimony of one man equals that of
 two women.
 Kuwait holds no Kuwaiti political prisoners but continues to hold foreign detain-
 ees and prisoners accused of collaboration with the occupying Iraqi forces, a criminal
 charge under Kuwaiti law. As noted above, most of the individuals convicted in mar-
 tial law courts (including the majority of collaborators) did not receive a fair trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 right to individual privacy and sanctity of the home is provided for in the Constitu-
 tion, but there were credible reports that authorities continued to ignore this riglht
 Kuwaiti law requires search warrants issued by the court or the prosecutor unfess
 the police are in hot pursuit of a suspect fleeing the scene of a crime or there is
 an indication of the presence of alcohol or narcotics on the premises. The prosecutor
 issues search warrants to conduct searches on public premises.
 Kuwaiti police frequently manned checkpoints on major roads to search for weap-
 ons, infiltrators, or persons without legal residence permits. Although drivers could
 legally refuse to have their vehicles searched, most allowed the police to do so.
 There were numerus credible reports of harassment and arrest of foreign nationals
 (especially peoples whose leaders were associated with supprt for Iraq's invasion
 of Kuwait, as well as bidoon) at checkpoints. Foreigners wlthout residence permits
 were also subject to arrest and detention.
 In 1986 the Government restricted the right of Kuwaiti males to marry foreigners,
 decreeing that advance official approval would be required. Government oiials
 said that concern about meeting the State's responsibilities for the children of non-
 Kuwaiti spouses residing outside the country motivated the action, but the Govern-
 ment was also known to be concerned about the  wing number of Kuwaiti males
 marrying foreigners rather than Kuwaiti women. Kuwiti women were publicly ad-
 vised against marrying foreign nationals. The Government has only sporadically en-
 forced the law.
 There is occasional surveillance of individuals and communications.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-There are laws that permit the Government to
 restrict speech and press freedoms, and the Government applied these laws on some
 occasions in 1993. Many Kuwaitis, including critics of the Government, discussed is-
 sues and offered their opinions in public and private meetings. However, public crit-
 
 
 1228
 icism of the Amir or Islam is not permitted, and some public meetings were subject
 to surveillance by Interior Ministry personnel.
 In January 1992, the Government rescinded the 1986 decrees that provided for
 prepublication censorship. The Kuwaiti Journalists Association concurrently drafted
 and implemented a code of journalists' professional ethics. However, less overt con.
 straints on press freedom remain.
 The press law restricts the press from publishing materials that contain direct
 criticisms of the Amir, that involve official confidential communications or treaties
 and agreements with other states, or that "might incite people to commit crimes,
 create hatred, or spread dissension among the people." With the end of
 prepublication censorship, the Kuwaiti press had to become its own censor exercis-
 ing judgment about what to print under the press law, subject to potential govern-
 ment legal action. The Government sometimes used the law to control and punish
 the press during 1993. For example, the Attorney General issued a statement in-
 structing local newspapers to ban reporting on financial scandals. The local ress
 published editorials denouncing the ban, and "violators" of the ban have not een
 punished. Despite numerous efforts by various parties to obtain his release, a Yem-
 eni journalist remained in the main deportation center where he had been sent in
 1991 after reporting on a controversy at the Ministry of Education.
 The press discussed a wide variety of social, economic, and political issues and
 criticized government policies and officials, taking care to avoid criticism that the
 Government might construe as libelous in nature. The press criticized senior Ku-
 waiti officials, including the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defense, and the Min-
 ister of Interior, all of whom belong to the Al-Sabah family, on some issues but
 avoided criticism of the Amir. Foreign press reporting from Kuwait is uncensored,
 and foreign journalists have generall-y open access to the country. Newspapers must
 have a license from the Ministry of Information. By law, publishers lose this license
 if their publications d not appear for 6 months.
 One weekly leftist newspaper that served as an oppositionist democratic forum re-
 sumed publication in 1993; it had been banned since before the invasion. In March
 the National Assembly overturned a 1988 Amiri decree dealing with secret state
 documents. The Amiri decree, issued during a period when the National Assembly
 had been dissolved, gave ministers discretion to treat as state secrets practically all
 official documents that were not officially declassified. Under this decree, journalists
 who revealed the contents of apparently innocuous documents could be subject to
 criminal prosecution.
 In a related case, the courts ruled in favor of an opposition newspaper that had
 been charged with publishing military secrets.
 The Government owns and controls radio and television, but the Middle East
 Broadcasting Company and Egyptian television transmit their programs directly
 onto Kuwaiti television without censorship. Satellite dishes are not forbidden, and
 many Kuwaitis watch a wide variety of uncensored cable television programming,
 including Israeli television.
 Kuwait has a Censorship Department which reviews all books, films, videotapes,
 eriodicals, and other material entering Kuwait in bulk or for commercial purposes.
 Inpractice, such censorship is sporadic and aimed mostly at material considered
 morally offensive or pornographic. In addition, the General Organization of Printing
 and Publishing controls the printing, publishing, and distribution of informational
 materials in Kuwait. Private Kuwaiti cooperative societies occasionally boycott pub-
 lications that offend moral sensibilities orslam.
 Academics operate with no apparent censorship of their teaching, research, or
 writings, while subject to the same restraints as the media with regard to criticism
 of the Amir or Islam.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Asociation.-While political parties are
 banned, the Government has taken no action against a number of political groups
 that acted much as parties during the 1992 elections and succeeding National As-
 sembly session. Political activity finds its outlet in informal, family-based social
 gatherings known as diwaniyas. The Constitution affirms the right to private as-
 sembly "without permission or prior notification," specifying that the police may not
 attendsuch private meetings,n and also affirms the right to public meetings, proces-
 sions, and gatherings that are "peaceful and not contrary to morals." Pubic gather-
 ings, however, must receive prior government approval, as must private gatherings
 of more than five persons that result in the issuance of a public statement. Profes-
 sional groups, bar associations, and scientific bodies operate and maintain inter-
 national contacts without government interference.
 To operate legallygin Kuwait, a nongovernmental organization (NGO) must obtain
 an official permit trough the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor. Since 1985, how-
 ever, the Ministry has granted no such permits for NGO's, with the sole exception
 
 
 1229
 of a permit issued in 1991 for the Women's Volunteer Association, headed by the
 wife of the Crown Prince. The Ministry has denied all other requests on the grounds
 that Kuwait already has enough NGO's. Over 55 NGO's are currently registered.
 The Government subsidizes all licensed NGO's. Kuwait's law on public interest asso-
 ciations has been criticized by international human rights organizations as being
 clearly defective when compared to international standards for freedom of associa-
 tion.
 Despite the Ministry's refusal to issue additional permits, private organizations
 have flourished in Kuwait, especially since liberation, their illegal status largely
 overlooked by the Government. In August, however, the Council of Ministers passed
 a decree stating that all unregistered NGO's must cease operations. The action ap-
 peared to be directed particularly at organizations working for the release of the
 missing Kuwaitis presumed held in Iraq and had the effect of eliminating some or-
 ganizations that have been engaged in human rights work (see Section 4). Some of
 these groups had engaged in activities that the Government viewed as politically
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Kuwait's state religion is Islam; the Constitution states
 that Shari'a (Islamic law) is "a main source of legislation* and also declares that
 "freedom of belief is absolute" but must not "conflict with public policy or morals."
 The ruling family and many prominent Kuwaiti families are Sunni Muslims. There
 are no restraints on worship by Shi'a Muslims, who constitute approximately 40
 percent of all Kuwaitis. Kuwait has a tiny Arab Christian minority that is allowed
 to practice its religion freely. There are a number of legally recognized expatriate
 Christian congregations and churches, including a Catholic diocese and an Amer-
 ican-sponsored Protestant church. Foreign nationals (e.g., Hindus, Sikhs, and Bud-
 dhists) who practice certain religions not sanctioned in the Koran may not build
 places of worship but may worship privately in their homes. Missionaries may not
 enter the country and proselytize, but foreign clergy may enter Kuwait to serve ex-
 patriate congregations in a pastoral function. Kuwaiti law prohibits religious edu-
 cation for religions other than Islam, although this law does not appear to be rigidly
 enforced. Non-Islamic clergy training institutions and publishing houses do not exist
 in Kuwait.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-In general, Kuwaiti citizens have the rght to travel freely within the
 country and to change their workplace as desired. Representatives of societies, asso-
 ciations, and trade unions wishing to travel abroad and participate in international
 meetings must receive prior permission. In theory, both men and women enjoy the
 same freedom to travel abroad, but there are limitations in practice. Husbands may
 prevent their wives and minor children from leaving the country by refusing to sign
 the required documentation that airport officials may ask departing wives to show
 upon leaving the country. Married women who apply for passp~orts must obtain their
 husband's signature on the application form. Kuwaitis are free to emigrate and to
 return.
 An anomalous situation exists in the case of the bidoon-stateless persons gen-
 erally of Bedouin background who claim that they have no nationality-who resided
 in Kuwait prior to the Iraqi invasion. The Government argues that many bidoon are
 merely concealing their true citizenship so that they can remain in Kuwait, become
 Kuwaiti citizens, and enjoy the generous government benefits provided to Kuwaitis.
 While some bidoon have longstanding ties to Kuwait, others immigrated to Kuwait
 in the 1960's and 1970's in response to the oil and construction booms. An estimated
 120,000 of the preinvasion bidoon population of about 220,000 remained in Kuwait
 in 1993. The Government prevented the return of bidoon who had left Kuwait, ei-
 ther willingly or by force, during the Iraqi invasion by delaying or denying their
 entrx, visas. The Government's action imposed severe separation hardships on some
 families.
 In 1993 the Government continued its postwar policy of reducing the number of
 Iraqis, bidoon, Palestinians, and other foreign nationals in the country. Under the
 arrangements worked out between the Kuwaitis and ICRC representatives, the
 ICRC was able to interview deportees to verify that they did not object to returning
 to Iraq. If they did object, they remained in the main deportation center.
 As of October, 5,000 of the 8,000 Gazan Palestinians remaining in Kuwait and
 holding Egyptian laissez passer travel documents had been given 1-year residence
 permits. The Government relaxed its restrictions on the remaining Gazans, estab-
 lishing a tacit agreement not to round up Gazans for violating residence laws. Many
 Gazans, however, left Kuwait voluntarily in response to social and economic pres-
 sure.
 Kuwait has no national legislation on refugees, but the Constitution prohibits the
 extradition of political refugees. Persons who are granted political asylum are auto-
 
 
 1230
 
 matically issued residence permits. The Government does not deport refugees who
 object to returning to their country of origin, but it does ask the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to resettle such persons in a third coun-
 try, as allowing them to remain in Kuwait would not fit in with the Government's
 population restructuring program, designed to reduce the number of foreigners in
 Kuwait. The UNHCR has refused all such requests. Refugees may also be held in
 detention if they are regarded as potential security risks.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Kuwaitis do not ejoy the right to change the head of state and government. The
 30 percent of adult Kuwaitis eligible to vote (see below) choose the membership of
 the National Assembly. Under the Constitution, executive power is vested in the
 Amir and under him in an appointed Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Min-
 ister who, in accordance with family politics, has been the Crown Prince. Following
 the 1992 elections, the Prime Minister formed a 16-member Cabinet which included
 6 elected Assembly members. While the Constitution places legislative power in the
 hands of the Amir and the Assembly, that has not prevented the Amir from twice
 suspending constitutional provisions and ruling extraconstitutionally.
 The most recent dissolution of the Assembly, decreed by the Amir in July 1986,
 lasted until the October 1992 elections. Although the Constitution grants the Amir
 the right to suspend the Assembly, it also obliges him to hold elections for a new
 Assembly within 2 months of the dissolution, otherwise the old Assembly regains
 its authority until the new one is elected. The 1986 decree circumvented the election
 requirement by suspending the section of the Constitution that called for new elec-
 tions. The Constitution gives the Amir the authority to suspend its articles only dur-
 ing periods of martial law. The Amir declares martial law. The Amir had previously
 dissolved the Assembly from 1976 to 1981. In the Assembly's absence, the Amir
 rules by decrees having the force of law. The Assembly has the constitutional right
 to review and approve or overturn Amiri decrees made in its absence. After its con-
 vocation, the 1992 Assembly reviewed all of the Amiri decrees and revoked some
 of them, including the official secrecy law (see Section 2.a.) and an amendment to
 the law on public associations.
 Constitutionally, elections for the Assembly are to take place every 4 years by se-
 cret ballot. The electoral law provides that candidates for the Assembly be self-nomi-
 nated, with multiple candidates permitted for the 50 seats. In 1992, 303 candidates
 registered for parliamentary elections.
 Kuwaiti law prohibits the establishment of political parties; however, the Govern-
 ment tacitly accepted the existence of several opposition political groups which acted
 much as political parties during the 1992 Assembly elections and the ensuing As-
 sembly session.
 The law limits suffrage to adult males who resided in Kuwait before 1920 and
 maintained a residence there until 1959 and to their adult male descendants (21
 years of age and older). According to current nationality law, naturalized citizens
 who do not meet the pre-1920 qualification but who have been naturalized citizens
 for at least 30 years must wait until 1996 to acquire the right to vote. This waiting
 period means that a large number of citizens do not have the right or the ability
 to participate in Kuwaiti elections.
 Distinctions based on parentage, length of residence, and gender limit suffrage to
 approximately 30 percent of the adult population. In the 1992 elections, approxi-
 mately 82,000 eligible Kuwaitis (almost the entire enfranchised male population)
 registered to vote. While a majority of candidates elected to the National Assembly
 expressed opinions favoring women's right to vote during their election campaigns,
 a public backlash after the election resulted in several proposals on this issue being
 held in committee. While both the Amir and the Prime Minister have publicly statea
 that they favor political rights for women, they have maintained that the National
 Assembly must decide the question.
 Non-Kuwaiti residents do not exercise any political rights, nor do they participate
 in decisions affecting their interests.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are now no private local human rights organizations legally functioning in
 Kuwait. Until the Council of Ministers' decree banning all unlicensed NGO's in Au-
 gust (see Section 2.b.), the privately organized Kuwait Association for the Defense
 of War Victims (KADWV), created in March 1991, sought to help in the repatriation
 of internees from Iraq and address the physical and psychological needs of former
 prisoners of war and torture victims of the Iraqi occupation. KADWV also sought
 
 
 1231
 to curb human rights abuses in Kuwait and took special interest in alleviating the
 problems of the bidoon. Before the ban, the Government by and large did not inter-
 fere in the work of the KADWV, although on December 10, 1991 (Human Rights
 Day), it censored a KADWV publication that commemorated the Universal Declara-
 tion of Human Rights. The Government has permitted visits and often met with
 representatives of various international organizations and private agencies con-
 cerned with human rights, while remaining largely unresponsive to their criticisms
 and recommendations.
 Government officials also cooperated with international humanitarian organiza-
 tions, including the ICRC, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), and
 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Women in Kuwait suffer discrimination in both law and practice in
 many areas. Women are denied the right to vote (see Section 3) and are tradition-
 ally restrained from freely choosing certain roles in society. There are no female
 judges or prosecutors, and only a few female Kuwaiti diplomats are stationed out-
 side of Kuwait.
 While spousal abuse exists in Kuwait, there are no shelters for women who have
 been abused by their husbands. Instead, cases are referred to the psychiatric depart-
 ment at the Ministry of Health. Police station and Ministry of Interior employees
 who handle complaints of spousal abuse are specifically instructed to try to reconcile
 the dispute within the family before opening a case. Each of the country's 50 police
 stations receives approximately one to two complaints of spousal abuse each week.
 Offending spouses are asked to sign a statement at the police station stating that
 they will not continue the abuse.
 Kuwaiti women who wear Western attire and foreign women are subjected to sex-
 ual harassment. The physical and sexual abuse of some expatriate Asian women (es-
 pecially from the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and other south Asian countries) who work
 as domestic servants received considerable attention in the press. Some observers
 believe that the problem worsened after liberation. On several occasions, the Phil-
 ippine Embassy sheltered over 100 women at once. Although most of these women
 sought shelter due to contractual or financial problems with their employers, some
 cases involved physical and sexual abuse.
 Domestic servants may take legal recourse against their employers for abuse but
 generally do not because of a generally substantiated fear of reprisal and a sus-
 tained fear that the police and the judicial system will side with the Kuwaiti em-
 ployer. In March the Court of Appeal reduced to 2 years a 10-year sentence that
 ad been imposed on a Jordanian couple who had been convicted of "unintention-
 ally" killing their Philippine maid through starvation and beatings. In July, how-
 ever, a Kuwaiti man and his Lebanese wife were sentenced to 7 years in jail for
 the "unintentional murder" of their Philippine maid. Although cited as an example
 of the Court's willingness to sentence a Kuwaiti for a crime committed against a
 domestic servant, the conviction on the basis of "unintentional murder" appeared
 highly questionable in view of the maid's injuries, which included a broken pelvis,
 broken arms, and burns over all her body. The Government said it acted to punish
 abusers, but government action did not deal effectively with the problem. The Gov-
 ernment established an office to investigate crimes and complaints involving domes-
 tics but has not yet acted on plans to establish a shelter for runaway maids. As an
 interim measure, the authorities designated a central police station to handle maids'
 complaints and shelter a small number of maids. In addition to assisting foreign em-
 bassies with the repatriation of some of these women, the Government began to reg-
 ulate recruitment agencies and close down unscrupulous ones.
 Kuwaiti courts have the authority to dissolve a marriage if a woman is in danger
 of being harmed by her husband; Kuwaiti judges have also found husbands guilty
 of spousal abuse. Prostitution, although prohibited by Kuwaiti law, takes place.
 Some legal discrimination against women exists, particularly with respect to Ku-
 waiti women married to foreign men. Such women receive no government housing
 assistance and must pay residence fees for their husbands; residence is not guaran-
 teed for their husbands unless the husband is working. In contrast, Kuwaiti men
 married to foreign women do not have to pay any fees for their spouses, whose right
 to residence is automatic. Females do not receive social security benefits. Under the
 Islamic laws of inheritance, male heirs receive twice as much as do female heirs.
 (These laws apply only to Muslims; a special judge handles cases for non-Muslims.)
 Women may own property and have the same property rights as men do.
 
 
 1232
 Women are restricted from working in "dangerous industries and trades harmful
 to the health.' They are promised "remuneration equal to that of a man provided
 she does the same work.' This promise is respected in practice.
 Kuwaiti women may drive and do not have to follow a dress code. They have full
 access to government-provided higher education, and an estimated 60 percent of
 women of working age are employed. Women work as doctors, engineers, lawyers,
 and professors. A few women have reached senior government positions. In July a
 woman was appointed to the Amiri Diwan (royal court) as Director of Political Af-
 fairs; a July Amiri decree named the first female president of Kuwait University.
 In September the woman Director of Political Affairs in the Amiri Diwan became
 Under Secretary in the Ministry of Higher Education. Kuwait named its first
 woman ambassador in 1993 and the state-owned Kuwait Petroleum Corporation
 (KPC), which runs Kuwait's oil industry, named a woman as its Managing Director
 for Administration and Economic Affairs, one of KPC's four top positions.
 While a number of individual Kuwaiti women speak openly, about the need to
 grant more rights to women, Kuwait lacks an organized women s rights movement.
 Before the invasion, the Kuwait Trade Union Federation (KTUF) had a Working
 Woman Committee. The Committee has not yet resumed full activities since the
 Gulf war.
 Another group, the Women's Social-Cultural Society, has committees dealing with
 cultural affairs, social activities alms, nurseries, cancer, the media, cooking, tailor-
 ing, illiteracy eradication, and tle Kuwaitis presumed detained in Iraq. The Society
 also concerns itself with statistical studies on women, cases of Kuwaiti women mar-
 ried to non-Kuwaitis, legal and psychological counseling for women, and children's
 welfare.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates its commitment to children's human
 rights and welfare through financial means. For example, the Government provides
 child benefit allowances and provides free education and health care to all Kuwaiti
 children. The Government also subsidizes infant formula.
 Governmental expenditures on children's welfare cover orphans, foster children,
 handicapped children, and mentally impaired children. The Government also pro-
 vides monthly financial assistance or approximately 10,000 limited-income families
 with children.
 There is no pattern of societal abuse (including child prostitution) of children.
 Children of persons awaiting deportation are held along with their parents at the
 main deportation facility. The Ministry of Interior forbade schools, public and pri-
 vate, from accepting children who do not have valid residence permits.
 National/Racial(Ethnic Minorities.-The plight of the bidoon (long-term residents
 of undetermined nationality) remained one of the most pressing human rights
 abuses in 1993. In the late 1980's and up to the time of Iraq s invasion, the Govern-
 ment promulgated a series of measures that, inter alia, dropped the bidoon from the
 census rolls and stripped them of civil identification cards which had entitled the
 bearer to a variety of social services. Many of these persons were in limbo, without
 the legal right to work, attend school, travel in and out of Kuwait, or marry. The
 Government established a screening process to grant residence permits to idoon
 who had served in the Kuwaiti military and security forces and their families and
 to bidoon in special categories (children of Kuwaiti/bidoon marriages).
 In 1993 the President of Kuwait's Martial Judicial Authority announced that
 bidoon may no longer join the Kuwaiti army. (This decree reversed a 1967 law
 which allowed bidoon to enlist; it did not affect the bidoon already in the army.)
 Foreign nationals are prohibited from having majority ownership in virtually
 every business other than certain small service-oriented businesses and may not
 own property. The Government continued its Kuwaitization policy, begun in 1991,
 applying significant labor and educational access restrictions to foreigners, espe-
 cially Palestinians and other "suspect" nationalities. These persons found it difficult
 to obtain work and resident permits. The Government's tying of access to education
 to possession of a valid residence permit further restricted access to public edu-
 cation, creating hardships for some foreign nationals with families.
 In past years, as part of its deliberate demographic policy to reduce the number
 of expatriates in the country, the Government also made it difficult for foreign work-
 ers to sponsor their families for residency by installing high minimum wage require-
 ments for the individual workers wishing to aptly for family visas. In mid-1993,
 however the Government eased these difficulties by abolishing the visa fees for chil-
 dren and lowering the minimum wage requirements by almost 50 percent.
 Religious Minorities. -Before the 1986 dissolution of the National Assembly Is-
 lamic groups within that body secured a bar on granting citizenship to non-Musims
 that is stillin effect.
 
 
 1233
 
 The administration of Kuwait's extensive welfare programs reflected no evidence
 of discrimination among citizens based on religion. Kuwait's Shi'a minority are less
 likely, however, to be appointed to sensitive government positions, although two
 ministers, including the important Minister of Oil, and a high-ranking military offi-
 cer are Shi'a.
 People with Disabilities.-No institutionalized discrimination exists against phys-
 ically disabled persons in housing, employment, education, and provision of state
 services.
 While the Government has not legislated or otherwise mandated accessibility for
 the disabled, Kuwaitis show a high degree of concern about the problems facing peo-
 ple with disabilities. A Committee for Disabled People exists as part of the Ministry
 of Social Affairs and Labor, the Ministry which serves as the regulatory agency for
 such issues. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor also provides extensive benefit
 programs covering transportation, job training, and social welfare for the disabled.
 Although not required to do so by law, almost all grocery stores have designated
 special parking spaces for the disabled.
 A government rehabilitation center exists, as does a private society for handi-
 capped children.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Kuwaiti workers have the right to join unions, but
 Kuwaiti law prevents the establishment of more than one union per functional area
 or more than one general confederation. Union membership in 1993 was approxi-
 mately 28,400 people organized in 14 unions. All but two of the unions, the Bank
 Workers' Union and the Kuwait Airways Workers Union, are affiliated with the Ku-
 wait Trade Union Federation (KTUF). The KTUF consists of nine civil service
 unions (18,800 members) and three oil sector unions (6,900 members), but the oil
 unions have equal representation (36 members) in the 72-member KTUF assembly.
 The remaining two unions had approximately 2,700 members.
 Foreign workers, who constitute the vast majority of the work force, were  r-
 mitted by law to join unions as nonvoting members after 5 years of residence in u-
 wait. In practice, foreign workers interested in union membership may generally
 join within a year of starting employment and residency in Kuwait. In 1993 non-
 Kuwaitis constituted 33 percent of the unionized workers.
 Kuwaiti labor law stipulates that any new union must include at least 100 ork-
 ers, at least 15 of whom must be Kuwaiti. The International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions (ICFTU) criticizes the latter requirement because it prevents workers
 in sectors where few Kuwaiti nationals are employed, notably the construction and
 domestic sectors, from organizing in trade unions. The KTUF opened an "Expatriate
 Labor Office," responsible for resolving problems between foreign workers and their
 employers in the private sector. The office does not interact with the Government.
 It looks into complaints of foreign laborers, provides legal advice free of charge, and
 takes necessary action. The office assists al foreign laborers, regardless of whether
 or not they are union members.
 Although unions are legally independent organizations, in fact, the Government
 maintains a large oversight role with regard to their financial records; 90 percent
 of union budgets are in the form of government subsidies. Unions must also follow
 a standard format for internal rules and constitutions, which includes prohibitions
 of any involvement in domestic political, religious, or sectarian issues. In practice,
 these limitations have not prevented unions from engaging in a wide range of activi-
 ties. In 1992 and 1993, for example, unions played some role in domestic political
 affairs; the KTUF actively sought the return of the Kuwaitis detained in Iraq, sup-
 ported Kuwait's return to parliamentary life in October 1992, urged members of the
 electorate to vote, and called for standardization of Kuwaiti nationality.
 Under the law, a court may dissolve a union for violating labor laws or laws con-
 cerning the "preservation of public order and morals." Such a court decision may
 be appealed. The Amir may also dissolve a union by decree. No union has been dis-
 solved in either manner. Kuwaiti citizen union members have the right to elect rep-
 resentatives of their own choosing, provided the candidates are also Kuwaitis and
 can demonstrate that they have no criminal record.
 The right to strike is recognized but is limited by Kuwaiti labor law, which pro-
 vides for a compulsory negotiation followed by arbitration if a settlement cannot be
 reached between labor and management (see Section 6.b.).
 One strike occurred in April. Conducted by 170 petroleum workers protesting a
 12-year-old labor dispute, it was settled between the Ministry of Oil and the petro-
 leum syndicate within a few days. Kuwait is a member of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) and has ratified the 1948 ILO Convention 87 on Freedom of As-
 
 
 1234
 sociation. However, Kuwaiti laws do not have specific provisions to prohibit retribu-
 tion against strikers and strike leaders.
 The ILO's Committee of Experts (COE) reiterated again in 1993 its longstanding
 criticisms of a number of discrepancies between the Kuwati Labor Code and ILO
 Conventions 1, 30, and 87 on hours of work and freedom of association and noted
 the Government's assertion that draft revisions to the Labor Code fulfill all provi-
 sions of the conventions "except those which run counter to national security."
 Areas criticized by the ILO included the prohibition on establishing more than one
 trade union for a given field, the requirement that a new union must have at least
 100 workers, the requirement that foreign workers must reside in Kuwait for 5
 years before joining a trade union, the denial to foreign trade unionists the right
 to vote and to be elected, the prohibition against trade unions engaging in an" polit-
 ical or religious activity, and the reversion of trade union assets to the Mimstry of
 Social Affairs and Labor in the event of dissolution.
 The KTUF belongs to the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and
 the formerly Soviet-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers have the right to or-
 ganize and bargain collectively, subject to the restrictions cited above. These rights
 have been incorporated in the Labor Law and have, according to all reports, been
 respected in practice.
 Collective argaining is a three-step process beginning with direct negotiations.
 The Labor Law provides for direct negotiations between employers and "laborers or
 their representatives" in the private sector. In practice, most agreements are re-
 solved through negotiations, possibly with the assistance of the Ministry of Social
 Affairs and Labor.ome employers have wage scales set by wage surveys. If an ami-
 cable agreement is not reached, the parties may petition the Ministry of Social Af-
 fairs and Labor for settlement. If no agreed solution is reached by this means, the
 dispute is referred to a labor arbitration board composed of officials representing the
 High Court of Appeals, the Attorney General's office, and the Ministry of Social Af-
 fairs and Labor. Most differences do not reach arbitration.
 The Civil Service Law makes no provision for collective bargaining between gov-
 ernment workers and their employers. The government administratively sets civil
 service wages. Many consider civilservice wages and benefits more generous than
 wages and benefits for comparable jobs in the private sector. In practice, govern-
 ment workers' representatives and ministry officials hold coordination meetings on
 a periodic basis. If the individual ministry and its workers do not reach an agree-
 ment, the issue is raised to the Council of Ministers, whose chairman, the Crown
 Prince and Prime Minister, also chairs the Civil Service Council. Union officials re-
 solve most issues at the working level and enjoy free access to the Crown Prince
 and other senior officials.
 Kuwaiti labor law prohibits antiunion discrimination. Any worker who alleges
 antiunion discrimination has the right to appeal to the judiciary. There were no re-
 ports of discrimination against union or nonunion employees. Employers found
 guilty of antiunion discrimination must reinstate workers fired for union activities.
 There are no export processing zones in Kuwait.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor "except in cases specified by law or national emergency and with just remu-
 neration." Nonetheless, there continue to be credible reports that foreign nationals
 employed as domestic servants have been denied exit visas if they seek them with-
 out their employers' consent.
 Foreign nationals must obtain a Kuwaiti sponsor in order to obtain a residence
 permit and cannot change their employment without permission from their original
 spnaors. Domestic servants are particularly vulnerable to abuses from this practice
 because they are not protected by Kuwaiti labor law. Sponsors frequently hesitate
 to grant their servants permission to change jobs because of their financial invest-
 ment in the servants. In many cases employers exercise some control over their
 servants by holding their passports, although the Government prohibits this prac-
 tice and has acted to retrieve passports of maids involved in disputes.
 Domestic servants who run away from their employers can be treated as criminals
 under Kuwaiti law. In some reported cases, employers illegally withheld wages from
 domestic servants to cover the costs involved in bringing them to Kuwait. The Gov-
 ernment has done little, if anything, to protect domestics in such cases.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age under Kuwaiti
 law is 18 years for all forms of work, both full- and part-time. Compulsory education
 laws exist for children between the ages of 6 and 15. These laws are not fully ob-
 served in the nonindustrial sector. Some small businessmen employ their children
 on a part-time basis, and there have been unconfirmed reports that some south
 Asian domestic servants are under 18. The Minister of Social Affairs and Labor is
 
 
 1235
 
 charged with enforcing minimum age regulations. Employers may also obtain per-
 mits from the Ministry to employ juveniles between the ages of 14 and 18 in certain
 trades.
 Juveniles may work a maximum of 6 hours per day on the condition that they
 work no more than 4 consecutive hours followed by a rest period of at least 1 hour.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor is re-
 sponsible for enforcing all labor laws. There is no legal minimum wage in the pri-
 vate sector. A two-tiered labor market ensures high wages for Kuwaiti employees
 while foreign workers, particularly unskilled laborers, receive substantially lower
 wages. In f993 the minimum wage in the public sector administratively set by the
 Government, was a pproximately $630 a month (180 Kiuwaiti dinars) for Kuwaitis
 and approximately $315 a month (90 Kuwaiti dinars) for non-Kuwaitis, amounts
 sufficient to provide a decent living for a worker and his family.
 The Labor Law establishes general conditions of work for both the public and the
 private sectors, with the oil industry treated separately. The Civil Service Law also
 prescribes additional conditions for the public sector. Labor law limits the standard
 workweek to 48 hours with 1 full day of rest per week, provides for a minimum of
 14 workdays of leave each year, and establishes a compensation schedule for indus-
 trial accidents. Domestic servants, who are specifically excluded from the private
 sector labor law, frequently work long hours, greatly in excess of 48 hours.
 The ILO has urged Kuwait to guarantee the weekly 24-consecutive-hour rest pe-
 riod to temporary workers employed for a period of less than 6 months and workers
 in enterprises employing fewer than five persons. Reflecting the petroleum sector's
 importance to Kuwait, the law governing employment in this area is more generous
 than the general laws. It provides for a 40-hour workweek, 30 workdays of annual
 leave, and a generous sick leave policy which authorizes sick leave for up to 2 years.
 Laws establishing work conditions are not always applied uniformly to foreign work-
 ers. Kuwaiti labor law also provides for employer-provided medical care and com-
 pensation to workers disabled by injury or disease due to job-related causes. The
 law also requires that employers provide periodic medical examinations to workers
 exposed to environmental hazards on the job (i.e. chemicals asbestos etc.).
 The Government has issued occupational health and safety standards; however,
 compliance and enforcement appear poor, especially with respect to unskilled foreign
 laborers. Kuwaiti employers often exploit workers' willingness to accept substandard
 conditions. Foreign workers, especially unskilled or semiskilled south Asian work-
 ers, frequently face contractual disputes, poor working conditions, and some physical
 abuse. In August several Indian laborers accused the Kuwaiti police of beating them
 after police intervened in a bitter contractual dispute. They also alleged that some
 of them had occasionally been forced to work clearing unexploded mines along the
 Iraqi border, a task for which they had no training. In practice Kuwaiti labor laws
 do not protect most foreign workers well.
 Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations
 without jeopardy to their continued employment, and legal protections exist for
 workers who file complaints about such conditions. In 1992 there were 798 occupa-
 tional injuries, primarily in the sectors of construction and building, manufacturing,
 hotels and restaurants, and transportation. To cut accident rates, the Government
 periodically inspects installations to raise awareness among workers and employers
 and ensure that they abide by the safety rules, control the pollutiun resulting from
 certain dangerous industries, train workers who use new machines in specialized in-
 stitutes, and report violations.
