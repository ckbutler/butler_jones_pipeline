 WESTERN SAMOA
 Western Samoa, a small Pacific island country with a
 population of around 165,000, is located approximately 1,600
 miles northeast of New Zealand. It received independence from
 that country in 1962 and still looks to it as a model for its
 governmental and educational systems. At independence, it
 adopted a Constitution proclaiming the nation to be an
 independent and sovereign state based on "Christian
 principles, and Samoan customs and tradition." The
 Constitution established a parliamentary democracy on the
 Westminster model but with certain concessions to Samoan
 cultural practices. It provides for a Samoan head of state, a
 unicameral legislature, an independent judiciary, protection
 of Samoan land and traditional titles, and guarantees of
 fundamental rights and freedoms.  Executive authority is
 vested in the Head of State, with the Government administered
 by the Cabinet, consisting of the Prime Minister and eight
 ministers chosen by the Prime Minister. All legislation
 passed by the Legislative Assembly needs the approval of the
 Head of State before it becomes law. The present Head of
 State, Malietoa Tanumafili II, holds the position for life.
 His successors will be elected by the Legislative Assembly for
 5-year terms.
 The culture of Western Samoa is essentially Polynesian but
 uniquely Samoan. A proud people, Samoans believe that all
 Polynesian people trace their origins to Samoa. Traditional
 authority is vested in the matai (leader of an extended
 family). Each extended family, or aiga, has at least one
 matai, who is appointed by a consensus of the aiga. Ownership
 of land is legally vested in the matai. It is the matai's
 responsibility to direct the economic, social, and political
 affairs of the aiga. There are 362 villages in Western Samoa
 with a total of over 20,000 matai. Each village is governed
 by a Fono or council of matai, which can fine or otherwise
 punish offenses against village rules. Western Samoa does not
 have any defense force. The small national police force is
 firmly under the control of the Government.
 The economy is primarily agricultural, with limited potential
 for development. It is susceptible to shifts in world prices
 for its export commodities, such as coconut oil. Western
 Samoa is heavily dependent on foreign aid, particularly from
 New Zealand, and on remittances sent to family members by the
 approximately 300,000 Samoans living abroad in Australia, New
 Zealand, and the United States.
 There were no significant human rights problems in 1988.

 WESTERN SAMOA
 C. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment are prohibited by law, and there have been no
 reports of such practices.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The law contains safeguards against arbitrary arrest, and
 these are observed in practice. Preventive detention and
 exile do not take place.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Western Samoan law assures the right to a fair public trial,
 and this right is honored. All charges are stated formally
 and clearly. Defendants are entitled to counsel. There are
 no special courts to deal with political or security offenses,
 and the judiciary is independent of government interference or
 influence. Decisions of village matai about customary law are
 not subject to judicial review, but there have been no
 allegations of arbitrary or excessive punishments.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government respects the privacy of its citizenry and does
 not permit arbitrary interference with the family, home, or
 correspondence. Both law and local custom provide for
 protection from invasion of the home or seizure of property
 without substantive and procedural safeguards, including
 search warrants.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and the press are fundamental parts of the
 Constitution. They are respected in law and practice. The
 press is independent of the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of peaceful assembly
 and the right to form associations. There are no significant
 restrictions.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of iRligion
 Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution, along
 with freedom of thought and conscience. Each person has the
 right to change religions or belief and to worship or teach
 religion alone or with others. There is no government-favored
 religion. Nearly 100 percent of the population is Christian.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no controls upon citizens of Western Samoa regarding
 internal movement or resettlement. Foreign travel is
 unrest:icted, and the right to return guaranteed. There are
 no refugees from or in Western Samoa.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Power in Western Samoa is vested in the Prime Minister and the
 Legislative Assembly. Under the Constitution, the Assembly is
 elected every 3 years. Forty-five of its members are elected
 by the approximately 20,000 village chiefs (matai), and the
 other 2 seats are filled by elections among those citizens who
 are not Samoan by heritage. There are numerous female matai,
 and some women serve as members of the Legislative Assembly.
 Although there is increasing pressure for popular elections,
 this concept is seen by many as conflicting with "Fa'a Samoa"
 (the Samoan way). The existing political structure is viewed
 as democratic, in that the matai traditionally consult with
 their extended families before making decisions such as
 selecting candidates for the Assembly. The matai system is
 conservative but does allow for change. While Samoans must
 show respect and obedience to their matai in family and
 communal affairs, the matai have well-defined responsibilities
 which, if not met, can result in removal.
 Western Samoa has only the rudiments of political parties.
 The first one, founded in 1982, was the Human Rights
 Protection Party (HRPP); its leader, Tofilau Eti, is currently
 Prime Minister. Although a second party, the Samoan National
 Development Party (SNDP), was formed during 1988, replacing
 the previous Christian Democratic Party which had been founded
 in 1985, the political process in Western Samoa remains very
 much a function of personality rather than party. As a
 result, several previous elected governments fell before the
 end of their prescribed 3-year terms when supporters defected
 to the opposition.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In the absence of allegations of abuse of human rights in
 Western Samoa, no international or nongovernmental bodies have
 conducted investigations. There are no official or private
 human rights organizations in Western Samoa.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Samoa is a homogeneous society with no significant ethnic
 minorities. Samoan politics and culture are the product of a
 heritage of chiefly privilege and power, and persons of good
 family have certain advantages. Women traditionally occupy a
 subordinate role. The functioning of the matai system,
 including the democratic consensus method of selecting the
 matai themselves, tends to work against systematic
 discrimination.
 The Samoan Constitution makes special provision to preserve
 the political rights of non-Samoans. Persons of mixed

 WESTERN SAMOA
 ancestry who are culturally Samoan are fully accepted and can
 attain positions of considerable wealth and influence.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Western Samoan workers have complete and unrestricted rights
 to establish and join organizations of their own choosing.
 While trade unions have not emerged in the private sector, the
 Government does not restrict efforts to develop them. A public
 service association representing government workers, an
 increasingly important sector of the work force, does exist.
 The Supreme Court has upheld the right of government workers
 to strike, subject to certain restrictions imposed principally
 for reasons of public safety. The public service association
 freely maintains relations with international bodies and
 participates in bilateral exchanges.
 b. The Right ta Organize and Bargain Collectively
 While workers have the right to engage in collective
 bargaining, there is little practice of this right because of
 the absence of unions in the private sector. However, the
 public service association engages in collective bargaining on
 behalf of government workers. Arbitration and mediation
 procedures are in place to resolve labor disputes, though
 these rarely arise. Labor law and practice are uniform
 throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law and does not
 occur in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Under the terms of the Labor and Employment Act of 1972 and
 Regulations of 1973, it is illegal to employ children under 15
 years of age except in "safe and light work." The law does
 not apply to service rendered to the matai, some of whom
 require children to work at what might be considered child
 labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Labor and Employment Act of 1972 and Regulations of 1973
 established for the private sector a 40-hour workweek and a
 minimum wage of $0.25 an hour. This small minimum wage
 suffices for a minimum standard of living when supplemented by
 the subsistence farming and fishing which most families engage
 in. The law also establishes certain rudimentary safety and
 health provisions. Independent observers report, however,
 that the safety laws are not strictly enforced except when
 accidents highlight noncompliance. In addition, many
 agricultural workers, among others, are inadequately protected
 from pesticides and other hazards because of limited employer
 awareness of occupational hazards. Government education
 programs are addressing these concerns. The law does not
 apply to service rendered to the matai. Government employees
 are covered under different, more stringent regulations, which
 are adequately enforced.
