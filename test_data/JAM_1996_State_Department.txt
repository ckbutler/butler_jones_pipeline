 JAMAICA
 Jamaica is a constitutional parliamentary democracy and a member of the Com-
 monwealth of Nations. Two political parties have alternated in power since the first
 elections under universal adult suffrage in 1944; a third major party was estab-
 
 
 491
 lished in late 1995. The last general election, held in March 1993, was marred by
 political violence and fraud. The judiciary is independent but lacks adequate re-
 sources.
 The Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) has primary responsibility for internal se-
 curity, assisted by the Island Special Constabulary Force. The Jamaica Defence
 Force (army, air wing, and coast guard) is charged with supporting the JCF in
 maintaining law and order, although it has no powers of arrest. While civilian au-
 thorities generally maintain effective control of the security forces some members
 of the security forces were charged with committing human rights abuses.
 The economy is based on primary products (bauxite and alumina, sugar, bananas),
 services (tourism, finance), and light manufacturing (garment assembly). The Gov-
 ernment promoted private investment to stimulate economic growth and moderniza-
 tion, pursuing in the process a sometimes painful program of structural adjustment.
 Annual per capita income is $1,850 but this figure is misleading as there is a large
 and widening gap between the weaithy and the impoverished.
 The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens; however,
 problems remained in certain areas. Although members of the security forces com-
 mitted extrajudicial killings and beatings and carried out arbitrary arrests and de-
 tentions, the Government moved effectively to punish some of those involved. Prison
 and jail conditions remained poor, with overcrowding, brutality against detainees,
 dismal sanitary conditions, and inadequate diet the norm. The judicial system was
 overburdened and lengthy delays in trials were common. Political violence, largely
 absent since the 1993 election, reappeared. Economic discrimination and violence
 against women remained problems, as did mob violence against those suspected of
 breaking the law.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The security forces frequently em-
 ployed lethal force in apprehending criminal suspects, usually in the guise of shoot-
 outs. This resulted in the killing by police of 140 people during the year. While alle-
 gations of "poie murder" were frequent, the vaidity of some of the allegations was
 suspect. This problem is the result of unresolved, longstanding antipathy between
 the security forces and certain communities, especially among the urban poor. The
 JCF conducted bth administrative and criminal investigations into incidents in-
 volving fatal shootings by the police. The JCF policy statement on the use of force
 incorporates U.N.-apprved language on basic principles on the use of force and fire-
 arms by law enforcement officiala.
 The authorities suspended four policemen and charged one with murder, after
 they allegedly beat to death a 22-year-old man in a West Kingston police station
 in April. Police are investigating the suspicious death in May of a man held in the
 Port Antonio jail.
 In September a jury found a policeman charged with murder in connection with
 a July 1995 incident in Mandeville not guilty. In that incident, two policemen fired
 warmng shots to disperse a crowd, killing one person and wounding two others. In
 March the authorities brought murder charges against another policeman, one who
 fired into a crowd of demonstrators in West Kingston in October 1995. The courts
 ave a constable in St. James a suspended 3-year sentence for unlawful wounding,
 fllowing a 1994 incident in which he shot a detainee in the back during a struggle.
 There were no developments in the murder trial of a JCF officer accused in two
 July 1993 killings. No action was reported in the civil lawsuits brought by relatives
 of two men who died in the Constant Spring jail in October 1992.
 Poitical violence re surged in 1996. The former chairman of the opposition Ja-
 maica Labour Party (JLP) resigned in 1995 and established a new party, the Na-
 tional Democratic Movement (NDM), late that year. Tensions between the JLP and
 NDM remained high, with frequent vilification of the NDM by JLP leaders. Begin-
 ning in January, strongly politicized areas of Kingston and Spanish Town were re-
 peatedly wracked by potical violence. According to police, this led to 10 deaths by
 mid-year, including murders of NDM   and JLP supporters. The Government de-
 ployed strong police and military detachments to the affected areas in response to
 serious outbreaks of violence, which significantly dampened the level of political vio-
 lence. However, the Government could not afford to maintin strong detachments
 in all affected areas at all times.
 Vigilantism, involving spontaneous mob executions in response to crime, rose in
 1996, beth in rural areas and in Kingston. Mobs killed 10 persons in West Kingston
 between November 1995 and September 1996, 5 of whom were charged with murder
 at the time of their own deaths. Official investigations into the kilings did not un-
 
 
 cover any information. Mobs lynched four other persons suspected of robberies in
 rural St. Catherine in late 1995-early 1996. In May a crowd beat a man to death
 after he was allegedly caught sexually assaulting a 3-year-old girl in rural Hanover.
 In July crowds beat and slashed to death three other suspected robbers in rural St.
 Elizabeth (near Montego Bay). Police reported a total of 22 vigilante killings be-
 tween November 1995 and August 1996.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punlshment.-
 The law prohibits torture and other abuse of prisoners and detainees. However re-
 ports of physical abuse of prisoners by guards continued, despite efforts by the Gov-
 ernment to remove abusive guards and improve procedures.
 Prison conditions remained poor, with overcrowding, inadequate diet, poor sani-
 tary conditions, and insufficient medical care the norm. The Government continued
 to address these problems, allocating approximately $750,000 (75 percent of the cor-
 rectional services budget) for the improvement of prison facilities.
 The Government alowed private groups, voluntary organizations, international
 human rights organizations, and the media to visit prisons and monitor prison con-
 ditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-In 1994 Parliament repealed the Sup-
 pression of Crimes Act of 1974, which permitted warrantless searches and the arrest
 of persons "reasonably suspected" of having committed a crime. The Jamaica Con-
 stabulary Force Act, however, now contains several of these provisions, and there
 were continued reports that the police abused these provisions.
 The law requires police to present a detainee in court within 48 hours of deten-
 tion, but the authorities continued to detain suspects, especially those from poor
 neighborhoods, without presenting them before a judge within the prescribed period.
 Magistrates inquire at least once per week into the welfare of each person listed
 by the JCF as being detained. There is a functioning bail system.
 Foreign prisoners must pay for their own deportation once they have completed
 their sentences. If they cannot afford to pay, they are jailed until relatives or con-
 sulates can arrange for transportation. In effect, this constitutes an additional pris-
 on term for indigents.
 The Constitution prohibits exile, and no instances of exile occurred.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an indpendnt judi-
 ciay, which exists in practie. However, the judicial system is overburdened and op-
 erates with inadequate resources. Trials in many cases are delayed for years, and
 other cases are dismissed because files cannot be located. The Government initiated
 a night court in September 1995, which has had some success in reducing the back-
 log f cases.
 e Constitution allows the Court of Appeal and the Parliament to refer cases to
 the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the United Kingdom as a final court
 of appeal.
 While the defendant's right to counsel is well-established, the courts appoint coun-
 sel for indigents only in cases of a serious offense (e.g., murder, rape, robbery, gun
 offenses). However, the law does not consider many offenses, including wounding
 with intent to cause great bodily harm, as "serious." Thus the courts try many de-
 fendants without benefit of counsel.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary intrusion by the State into the private life of the
 individual. The revised Jamaica Constabulary Force Act continues to give security
 personnel broad powers of search and seizure similar to those granted by the former
 Suppression of Crimes Act.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice.
 The Jamaica Broadcasting Company, largely deregulated in 1988, operates two
 radio stations and one of the island's two television stations. The Government's
 broadcasting commission has the right to regulate programming during emer-
 gencies. Foreign television transmissions are unregulated and available to tens of
 thousands of Jamaicans through satellite antennas. The four largest newspapers, all
 privately owned, regularly report on human rights abuses, particularly those involv-
 ing the JCF. Foreign publications are widely available.
 Physical intimidation was reportedly employed against journalists to halt stories
 unfavorable to certain politicians and political activists.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 
 
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this ri ght in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the authorities respect
 them in practice.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The Government provides
 first asylum, and provided it to approximately 40 persons in 1994. Similar but
 smaller numbers of first asylum cases, mainly Cubans and Haitians, were accepted
 in 1995 and 1996. There were no reports of forced return of persons to a country
 where they feared persecution. The Government established a committee and formal
 procedures to review claims to refugee status. This committee denied all claims to
 refugee status by Cubans and Haitians who had arrived in Jamaica since 1994.
 However, several Cuban applicants were granted permission to stay in Jamaica on
 other grounds.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully. Periodic elections are held on the basis of universal suffrage. All citizens
 age 18 and over have the right to vote by secret ballot. The last general election,
 in March 1993, was marred by violence and fraud. The violence and-fraud was most
 prevalent in so-called garrison communities, which are dominated by the major po-
 litical parties. The People's National Party (PNP) holds a majority in the House of
 Representatives. The Jamaican Labour Party, which has alternated in power with
 the PNP since 1944, boycotted all by-elections since 1993, claiming that needed elec-
 toral reforms were not in place. Voter registration under an improved system was
 scheduled to begin island-wide on January 6, 1997.
 There are no legal limits on the participation of women in politics. Women hold
 some 13 percent of all political offices and 30 percent of the senior civil service posi-
 tions. Two of the 16 cabinet members are women, as is the PNP General Secretary.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights gups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigatin and publishing their findings on human rights cases. The work of the Ja-
 maica founcil for Human Rights, the country's only formal organization concerned
 with all aspects of human rights, was severely hampered by a lack of adequate re-
 sources which required a substantial reduction in its staff. Government officials are
 generally cooperative and responsive to the views of human rights organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on grounds of race, place of origin, polit-
 ical opinions, color, creed, or sex. The Government largely enforces these prohibi-
 tions in practice, except for widespread discrimination on the basis of political opin-
 ion in the distribution of scarce governmental benefits, including employment, espe-
 cially in the garrison communities (see Section 3).
 Women.-In practice, women suffer from economic discrimination, sexual harass-
 ment in the workplace, and social and cultural traditions that perpetuate violence
 against women, including spousal abuse. The Domestic Violence Act of 1995 came
 into effect in May 1996. It provides additional remedies for domestic violence, in-
 cluding restraining orders and other noncustodial sentencing. Violence against
 women is widespread, but many women are reluctant to acknowledge or report abu-
 sive behavior, leading to wide variations in estimates of its extent.
 The Constitution and the 1975 Employment Act accord women full equality. The
 Bureau of Women's Affairs, in the Ministry of Labour, oversees programs to ensure
 the legal rights of women. These programs have had limited effect to date, but have
 raised the awareness of problems affecting women. In June the Government estab-
 lished a steering committee, charged with creating a Commission on Gender and So-
 cial Equity by the end of the year.
 A number of active women's rights groups exist. They are concerned with a wide
 range of issues, including employment, viofence against women, political representa-
 tion. and the image of women presented in the media. Their effectiveness is mixed,
 but the groups were successful in advocating enactment of the Domestic Violence
 Act.
 
 
 Children.-The Government is committed to improving children's welfare. Ex-
 penditure on education and health rose 50 percent, twice the rate of growth in the
 overall budget. The Ministry of Education, Youth, and Culture is responsible for im-
 plementation of the Government's programs for children.
 The Juvenile Act of 1951 deals with several areas related to the protection of chil-
 dren, including prevention of cruelty, prohibition on causing or allowing juvenile
 begging the power to bring juveniles in need of care or protection before a juvenile
 court, the treatment of juvenile offenders, the regulation and supervision of chil-
 dren's homes, and restrictions on employment of juveniles. In June the visiting Ex-
 ecutive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said the Govern-
 ment had done very well in its efforts to improve the welfare and survival of chil-
 dren.
 People With Disabilities.-No laws mandate accessibility for people with disabil-
 ities. Several government agencies and nongovernmental organizations provide serv-
 ices and employment to various groups of disabled citizens.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law provides for the right to form or join a trade
 union, and unions function freely and independently of the Government. The Labor
 Relations and Industrial Disputes Act (LRIDA) defines worker rights. There is a
 spectrum of national unions, some of which are affiliated with political parties. Ap-
 proximately 15 percent of the work force is organized.
 The LRIDA neither authorizes nor prohibits the right to strike, but strikes do
 occur. Striking workers can interrupt work without criminal liability but cannot be
 assured of keeping their jobs. Workers in 10 broad categories of "essential services"
 are prohibited from striking, a provision the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 has repeatedly condemned as overly inclusive. The Government did not declare any
 strikes illegal in 1996.
 Unions maintain a wide variety of regional and international affiliations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Government rarely inter-
 feres with union organizing efforts. Judicial and police authorities effectively enforce
 the LRJDA and other labor regulations. All parties are firmly committed to collec-
 tive bargaining in contract negotiations, even in some nonunion settings. An inde-
 pendent Industrial Disputes Tribunal (IDT) hears cases where management and
 labor fal to reach agreement. Any cases not resolved by the JDT pass to the civil
 courts. The number of industrial disputes referred to the IDT declined. The IDT
 made decisions in a few cases, while others were settled by agreement or with-
 drawn. However, the majority of cases referred to the IDT remained unresolved. The
 LUIDA prohibits antiunion discrimination, and employees may not be fired solely
 for union membership. The authorities enforced this law effectively.
 Domestic labor laws apply equally to the "free zones" (export processing zones).
 However, there are no unionized companies in any of the 3 zones-established in
 1972, 1985, and 1988--which employ approximately 18,000 workers. Organizers
 attributethis to resistance by foreign owners in the zones to organizing efforts, but
 attempts to organize plants within the zones continue. Company-controlled "work-
 ers' councils" handle grievance resolution at most free zone companies, but do not
 negotiate wages and conditions with management. Management determines wages
 and benefits within the free zones; these are generally as good as or better than
 those in similar industries outside the zones. The Ministry of Labor has not per-
 formed factory inspetions in the free zones since 1992.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution does not specifi-
 cally address the matter of forced or compulsory labor. However, Jamaica is a party
 to both ILO conventions that prohibit compulsory labor, and there were no reports
 that this practice exists.
 d. Mimmum Age for Employment of Children.-The Juvenile Act provides that
 chldren under th    e of 12 shall not be employed except by parents or guardians,
 and that such employment may only be in domestic, agricultural, or horticultural
 work. Enforcement, however, is erratic. Children under 12 peddle goods and services
 on city streets, but there is no evidence of widesread illegal employment of children
 in other sectors of the economy. The Educationa At stipulates that all children be-
 tween 6 and 11 years of age must attend elementary school. Industrial safety, p-
 lice, and truant officers are charged with enforcement. Under current econodmc cir-
 cumstances, however, thousands of children are kept home to help with housework
 and avoid school fees. A 1994 UNICEF report stated that 4.6 percent of children
 below the age of 16 worked to help support their households.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-iThe minimum    wage, raised from  $15.00
 (J$500) to $22.50 (J$800) per week in July, is widely considered inadequate. Most
 salaried workers are paid more than the legal minimum. Work over 40 hours per
 
 
 495
 
 week or 8 hours per day must be compensated at overtime rates, a provision that
 is widely observed.
 The Labor Ministrfs Industrial Safety Division sets and enforces industrial
 health and safety standards, which are considered adequate. Industrial accident
 rates, particularly in the bauxite/alumina industry, were once again low. Public
 service staff reductions in the Ministries of Labor, Finance, National Security, and
 the Public Service have contributed to the difficulties in enforcing workplace regula-
 tions. The law provides workers with the right to remove themselves from dan-
 gerous work situations without jeopardy to their continued employment if they are
 trade union members or covered by the Factories Act. The law does not specifically
 protect other categories of workers in those circumstances.
