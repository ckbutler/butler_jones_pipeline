 VIETNAM
 
 Since 1975, both North and South Vietnam have been subject
 to unified rule by a communist government with its capital
 in Hanoi. Since the fall of the former South Vietnamese
 government at least tens of thousands of Vietnamese have
 been held and continue to be held in so-called "re-education"
 camps, under harsh ccnditicns.
 During the past four years, nearly one millicn Viet-
 many of them ethnic Chinese, have fled Vietnam. Government
 officials have both promoted and forced this exodus, arranging
 boats and exit permits and extracting payments from those
 leaving. Conditions on the boats were unfit and few vessels
 were adequately provisioned. As a result, at least tens of
 thousands - and perhaps more - perished at sea. There are
 many reports of refugee boats being attacked or seized in
 flight because they did not make necessary payments to
 Government officials. Sources sometimes provide inconsistent
 accounts; refugee reports in particular require interpretation.
 However, this available material, when carefully analyzed,
 indicates a consistent pattern of government policies
 violating human rights.
 In addition, Vietnam's invasion and occupation of Kampuchea
 raises profound questions of human rights abuse in that
 country.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There are reports that prisoners have been beaten. Deprivation
 of adequate medical and nutritional care for political
 prisoners and prisoners of conscience over extended periods
 has resulted in acute suffering, permanent physical impairment.
 and death in numerous reported incidents. A notable example
 of such acute suffering inflicted upon a prisoner of conscience
 is the crippling of Thich Tri Quang, religious leader and
 dissident under the current and previous regimes.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Vietnamese government admitted that a few "war criminals*
 have been executed. Vietnamese officials' statements, for
 example, noted that one former province chief received the
 death sentence from a military tribunal and death sentences
 were recently announced for some involved in trying to
 arrange refugee escapes from the SRV. However, on most
 
 (545)
 
 
 546
 occasions, official government statements are vague as to
 the kinds of punishment inflicted.
 Other information indicates that some executions may have
 taken place at "re-education camps." The limited evidence
 available to the Department of State suggests, however, that
 executions are neither numerous nor wide-spread. "Re-
 education camps" for adherents of the previous regime have
 drawn criticism for their treatment of prisoners. While
 some observers report good conditions in camps they were
 permitted by the government to visit, other reports indicate
 prisoners are subjected to hard labor, including dangerous
 mine clearing and ordinance disposal, and are given rations
 at or below subsistence levels.
 C. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Many people have been jailed without being specifically
 charged and without trial, often because of association with
 the former government or because of alleged resistance
 activities. No procedure similar to habeas corpus is
 available. The authorities have subjected thousands of
 adherents and even opponents of the previous government to
 "re-education," a type of reform designed to produce conformity
 by confinement, indoctrination and labor. "Re-education"
 takes place during seminars after work and in "re-education
 camps," some located in primitive remote areas for more
 thorough "reform." Official Vietnamese figures for 1977
 claim fewer than 50,000 "criminals" in camps; other 1977
 estimates varied, with some up to the hundreds of thousands.
 Amnesty International in its 1978 report estimated those
 incarcerated number in the "tens of thousands," and noted
 that the announced 3-year period of incarceration has been
 exceeded. There were no large-scale releases in 1978,
 lending support to refugee reports that the 1975-1978 period
 was only for "study" and that "true re-education" is only
 now getting underway. Available information is not good
 enough to establish an accurate figure on numbers involved
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In general both political prisoners and those accused of
 ordinary offences are denied public trial and access to
 counsel. As far as is known, no one sent to a re-education
 camp has undergone a public trial. Some leading civilian,
 military and religious figures of the former Republic of
 Vietnam have been imprisoned without trial.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The North Vietnamese system of population surveillance
 by block wardens now extends to Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon)
 and other southern towns, although the system works imperfectly
 in the South, partly because of a shortage of trusted Party
 workers. Citizens have a duty to inform on each other.
 
 
 547
 Troops sometimes search residences of those denounced, and
 one knowledgeable former foreign resident claims they
 plant evidence to compromise selected families. Privacy
 of international correspondence is not respected; censorship
 is the rule and individuals receiving mail from abroad are
 subject to official inquiry. Those incarcerated are required
 to make denunciations of others.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 In addition to "re-education," many of those associated
 with the old government have suffered confiscation of their
 private property, and, among other forms of discrimination,
 are denied employment and higher education for their children.
 Economic and social pressures are also used to drive city
 families out to rural "new economic zones." This policy has
 been imposed more broadly to include Vietnam's Chinese
 residents, many of whom had adopted Vietnamese citizenship.
 Hanoi's efforts, following thirty years of war, to turn the
 creative energies of the Vietnamese people to reconstruction
 and economic development were short lived. After two years
 of border and ideological disputes with the Kampuchean regime
 of Pol Pot, the Vietnamese resorted to military action in
 December 1977 and a year later launched a major military
 invasion capturing Phnom Penh in January. Hanoi has thus
 far disdained international calls fdr a political solution
 and negotiations, pursuing instead military consolidation of
 its control in Phnom Penh.
 Vietnam has not yet achieved self-sufficiency in food. Since
 the end of the war, disorganization, mismanagement, a lack
 of foreign exchange for fertilizer, peasant unhappiness
 over collectivization, and low state-controlled paddy prices
 have caused a large rice deficit. Rice rations have been
 sharply cut generally and regularly. The meat ration
 has dropped as well. Rations tend to be lower in the
 South. As Vietnam squandered its resources on military
 ventures, foreign grain aid to the SRV, from the USSR,
 reached hundreds of thousands of metric tons per month
 from 1975 through 1979; SRV domestic needs for outside
 food assistance in 1979 are estimated at around two million
 tons without calculating SRV needs to provision their forces
 and the population they control in Kampuchea.
 Attempts to collectivize agriculture in the South have
 helped cause food shortages. Peasants who owned their land
 are unhappy at losing ownership and being forced to put land
 and tools into collectives. Peasants have reacted to low
 government prices for unmilled rice by cutting back to
 subsistence cultivation. Fishermen have up to 90% of their
 catch taken in tax, apparently as part of a government plan
 to collectivize the fishing industry. That industry also
 suffers from a restriction on fuel for fishing outboards and
 controls to cut the number of attempts to escape by small
 boat.

 Traditional Vietnamese respect for and encouragement of
 learning continue. Authorities have announced a literacy
 campaign. Certain restrictions, however, reportedly
 apply to middle class children and to the Chinese, some of
 whom are kept from higher education. Children of supporters
 of the previous government also now have limited opportunity
 for schooling.
 Health care in the South has declined since 1975 despite
 efforts of the new regime. The lack of medicines and
 trained technicians is part of the problem. Medical personnel
 have been shifted from the South to the North and others
 have fled the country leaving facilities unmanned.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Vietnamese authorities have attempted to divide and control
 the Catholic Church, the Buddhist Sangha, and the other
 religious sects. Catholicism may be practiced, but foreign
 priests have been expelled and the Church's teaching role
 restricted. Services may only take place on Sunday.
 Sermons must be approved. Priests are under government
 surveillance. Some have beem accused of crimes, including
 rape, with allegedly suborned witnesses ready to testify
 against them. Many Catholic priests are reportedly still
 jailed. Catholics themselves suffer discrimination in jobs.
 Buddhists have also resisted efforts to control them. In
 Can Tho, protest suicides in 1975 caused wide concern.
 Authorities have publicly claimed that the monk whose
 self-immolation started the protest was a sex offender.
 Eighteen Buddhist monks and nuns reportedly have committed
 self-immolation in Ho Chi Minh City over the past two years.
 The politically active An Quang Unified Buddhist Church
 reacted sharply when the government packed its leadership
 councils with pro-Party monks. In Ho Chi Minh City, demon-
 strating Buddhists were arrested in April 1977 and pagodas
 closed. The press denounced "bad Buddhists" and issued
 warnings of crackdown. An Quang leaders remain under
 arrest, with the exception of three who are held virtually
 incommunicado at the An Quang Pagoda in Ho Chi Minh City.
 Other religious groups (notably the Hoa Hao, a reformed
 Buddhist sect), have also resisted government control. The
 Hao Hao leadership is now reportedly imprisoned. The Govern-
 ment has sought to discredit the Hoa Hao leadership with
 reportedly fabricated evidence and suborned testimony. In
 the Mekong Delta, Hoa Hao bands are said to engage SRV
 troops in sporadic fighting.
 Virtually all media are government controlled.
 Freedom of assembly is not permitted.

 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Travel, both internal and foreign, requires government
 approval. A system of passes and control points severely
 restricts internal movement. Only government officials or
 approved spokesmen for quasi-governmental organizations
 receive permission to travel abroad. An increasing number
 of students travel abroad; it can be assumed that they are
 carefully chosen for political reliability, that their
 families remain in Vietnam and that most have good connec-
 tions with the Communist Party.
 A number of factors, including ethnic discrimination, lack
 of economic and educational opportunities, and fear of
 reprisals or of exile to remote areas and so forth have
 stimulated a mass exodus from Vietnam since 1975. As part
 of its general restructuring of the economy along socialist
 lines, Vietnam nationalized retail trade in March 1978.
 Its implementation fell hardest on ethnic Chinese and provided
 the opportunity for many Vietnamese to take out their animosity
 against the Chinese minority by confis6ating property. Viet-
 namese authorities made no effort to protect the ethnic Chinese.
 Hundreds of thousands of them, convinced they had no future
 in Vietnam, fled to China, greatly exacerbating tension
 between China and Vietnam. The situation of the Chinese
 remaining in Vietnam became even more precarious. The
 Vietnamese government then adopted a program to deliberately
 "facilitate" the departure of ethnic Chinese, functioning
 through special offices at the provincial Party level and
 charging large fees for permits to exit, passage, etc.. At
 its height early last summer, the exodus reached over
 60,000, mostly ethnic Chinese, a month. By mid-year the
 flow was stopped, at least temporarily, but discrimination
 against Chinese continues and it seems likely that many of
 the remaining Chinese will feel pressed to try to escape
 Vietnam despite the great dangers involved.
 Vietnamese who by past associations, employment or other
 concerns have been considered undesirable social elements by
 the government or party have also felt under'pressure to
 leave the country. While in some cases their property was
 confiscated or their employment restricted, they also felt
 under threat of exile to "new economic zones" or of being
 drafted to fight in the unpopular war in Kampuchea.
 During the past year thousands of Vietnamese fled their
 homeland in small boats and many now live in inadequate
 camps throughout Asia. Many others undoubtedly perished at
 sea. There are many reports of refugee boats being attached
 or seized in flight because they did not make necessary
 payments to Government officials.
 A few Vietnamese refugees who wanted to return to their own
 country have been allowed to do but were reportedly subject
 to "reeducation" for varying periods of time. Vietnamese
 officials have not been encouraging on the early return of
 other refugees who ask to go back to Vietnam.
 The authorities encourage and in some cases force (directly
 and indirectly) relocation of city dwellers to rural zones
 
 
 550
 for the stated purpose of rationalizing labor distribution
 throughout the nation. The movement, by official account,
 numbers in the hundreds of thousands. Economic pressure has
 forced many to leave voluntarily for these new zones.
 Nationalization of small businesses, short rations, no jobs
 and a currency change that effectively wiped out savings
 caused many town dwellers to leave their homes. Many
 others, however, were ordered to the zones, including
 families of those associated with the previous government.
 Economic pressures especially affect the poor, a primary
 target of the government effort to put more producers on the
 land.
 Tribal ethnic minorities in the South do not appear to have
 benefited from the autonomy that has in the past characterized
 Hanoi's dealings with northern tribal peoples. Some sporadic
 fighting continues in the Central Highlands as former
 government troops and Montagnard forces resist central
 authority. SRV officials have relocated some southern
 Montagnard communities to the lowlands and Vietnamese into
 the highlands. These efforts seek to isolate guerillas and
 weaken tribal cohesion.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Authority is concentrated in the Communist Party which
 controls the political process. The Politburo of the
 Central Committee of the Vietnam Communist Party (VCP)
 makes the decisions. The National Assembly endorses
 those decisions. A new constitution now being published
 appears to hold no changes affecting participation in the
 political process.
 Vietnam held a national election in 1976. These National
 Assembly elections provided some choice of non-Party
 candidates. However, only one list was presented. Voters
 could strike off candidates whom they did not like. Some
 reports claim cadres told voters whom to strike out. The
 electorate was required to participate in the election
 in order to have their ration cards validated.
 The Vietnam Fatherland Front (VFF) offers a form of officially-
 sponsored participation to non-Communist groups. The
 organization is not likely to provide any independent
 political activity; rather it serves to channel non-Communist
 actions into Party-approved paths.
 Labor receives close attention from the Vietnamese party and
 government. An article in the Hanoi official daily by a
 member of the Vietnam General Confederation of Trade Unions
 (VGFTU) Secretariat tied the labor movement to the decision
 of the 4th Vietnam Communist Party Congress to build socialism.
 Trade unions have the duty to build new socialist workers.
 The June 1977 draft political report of the VGFTU notes that
 trade unionism is the "broadest mass organization of the
 working class, a school of communism and a school for manage-
 ment of the economy and the state." The VGFTU president,
 Hoang Quoc Viet, is a member of the Vietnam Communist Party
 Central Committee.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Although some foreign visitors have toured Vietnam, including
 some U.S. Congressional delegations, none were given more
 than a superficial look at the SRV.
 The Vietnamese have shown some visitors and journalists a
 few model re-education camps and permitted them limited
 access to Ho Chi Minh City. There has been no independent
 outside investigation of the human rights situation in
 Vietnam. The Vietnamese failed to respond to a suggestion
 in 1976 from former American anti-war activists who asked
 for an inquiry into charges of human rights violations
 there. Amnesty International received no replies to queries
 to SRV leaders about reeducation. Of the 12 political
 prisoners adopted by AI, one was released in early 1977.
