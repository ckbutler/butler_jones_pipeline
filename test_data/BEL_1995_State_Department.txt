 BELGIUM
 Belgium is a parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarch who plays
 a mainly symbolic role. The Council of Ministers (Cabinet), led by the Prime Min-
 ister, holds office as long as it retains the confidence of the lower house of the bi-
 cameral Parliament. Constitutional reforms enacted in 1993 transformed Belgium
 from a unitary into a federal state. General elections held in May replaced regional
 councils with directly elected legislatures in Dutch-speaking Flanders, French-
 speaking Wallonia, and bilingual Brussels.
 Civilian authorities are in full command of the national, municipal, and judicial
 police forces.
 Belgium is a highly industrialized state with a vigorous private sector and govern-
 ment participation in certain industries. An extensive social welfare system sup-
 ports a high standard of living for most citizens.
 The Government fully respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and
 an independent judiciary provide effective means of dealing with instances of indi-
 vidual abuse.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials employed
 them.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile and the Government observes this prohibition. Arrested persons must
 be brought before a judge within 24 hours. Pretrial confinement is allowed under
 legally specified circumstances. The premise for such confinement is subject to
 monthly review by a panel of judges, which may extend pretrial detention based on
 established criteria (e.g., whether, in the court's view, the arrested person would be
 likely to commit further crimes or attempt to flee the jurisdiction if released). Ar-
 rested persons are allowed prompt access to a lawyer of their choosing or if they
 cannot afford one, an attorney appointed by the State. Bail exists in principle under
 Belgian law but is rarely granted and pretrial confinement is thus fairly common.

 Approximately 30 percent of the total prison population consists of pretrial detain-
 ees.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The Judiciary pro-
 vides citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process, enforcing the law's provision
 for the right to a fair trial. When a preliminary judicial investigatory phase is com-
 pleted, a suspect is formally charged if the evidence so warrants. Charges are clear-
 y and formally ste    and there is a presumption of innocence. All defendants have
 the right to be present, to have counsel (at public expense if needed), to confront
 witnesses, to present evidence, and to appeal. Military tribunals try military person-
 nel for common-law as well as military crimes. All military tribunals consist of four
 officers and a civilian judge; at the appellate level, the civilian judge presides. The
 accused has the right of appeal to a higher military court.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Intrference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices government authorities respect these prohibitions, and vio-
 lations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for these freedoms, and the
 Government respects these rights in practice. An independent press, an effective ju-
 diciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of
 speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 The Government operates several radio and television networks but does not con-
 trol program content. Programs are supervised by boards of directors which rep-
 resent the main political, linguistic, and opinion groups. A government representa-
 tive sits on each board but has no veto power. Private radio and television stations
 operate with government licenses. Almost all homes have access by cable to tele-
 vision from other Western European countries and elsewhere abroad.
 There are restrictions on the press regarding libel, slander, and the advocacy of
 racial or ethnic discrimination, hate, or violence.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice. Citizens are free to form or-
 ganizations and establish ties to international bodies, but the Antiracism Law (see
 Section 5) prohibits membership in organizations that practice discrimination overt-
 ly and repeatedleay.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government does not hinder the practice of any
 faith. The law accords "recognized" status to Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, Ju-
 daism, Anglicanism, Islam, and Greek and Russian Orthodoxy, and these receive
 subsidies drawn from general government revenues. Taxpayers who object to con-
 tributing to religious subsidies have no recourse. By law, each recognized religion
 has the right to provide teachers at government expense for religious instruction in
 schools. but not all avail themselves of this right.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. All asylum seekers can
 plead their cases before immigration authorities. There were no reports of forced ex-
 pulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee/asylee status. Asylum seekers arriv-
 ig by air with no papers may be detained for a maximum of 2 months in closed
 centers while awaiting consideration of their cases. Children in such centers do not
 attend school. Certain communes (administrative divisions of the Brussels region)
 such as Anderlecht, Brussels, and Saint Josse, which have already accepted large
 refugee populations, are not currently required by the central Government to give
 legal residence and benefits to new refuges/asylees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The law provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully,
 and citizens age 18 and older exercise this right in practice through periodic, free,
 and fair elections held on the basis of universal andpcompulsory (under penalty of
 fine) suffrage. Direct popular elections for parliamentary seats (excluding some sen-
 ators elected by provincial councils and others elected by Senate members) are held
 at least every 4 years. Opposition parties operate freely.
 Women hold some high-level positions in the Government formed after the May
 general elections. Two of 15 federal Ministers are women, and in the federal Par-
 liament, 18 of 150 House members and 16 of 75 senators are women. The law re-
 
 
 789
 quires that 33 percent of the candidates on the ballot in the next general election,
 to be held no later than 1999, be women.
 The existence of communities speaking Dutch, French, and German engenders
 significant complexities for the State. All major institutions, including political par-
 ties, are divided along linguistic lines. National decisions take into account the spe-
 cific needs of each regional and linguistic group.
 The last general elections also replaced regional councils with directly elected leg-
 islatures in Dutch-speaking Flanders, French-speaking Wallonia, and bilingual
 Brussels. Each regional parliament elects from among its members a regional gov-
 ernment, including a regional prime minister.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Numerous human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are very cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination based on the listed factors, and the Government
 enforces it. With Dutch, French, and German as official languages, Belgium has a
 complex linguistic regime, including language requirements for various elected and
 appointed, poaitone.
 Women.-The Government actively promotes a comprehensive approach to the in-
 tegration of women at all levels of decision making. The Division of Equal Oppor-
 tunity, a part of the Ministry of Labor, focuses specifically on issues affecting
 women, including violence against women, sexual harassment, and the participation
 of women in the political process.
 The law prohits physical abuse of women, and the Government enforces this
 ban. In 1995 less than 1 percent of all crimes reported (2,217 out of 253,962) were
 rape or sexual assault.
 In 1995 the Ministry of Labor assessed the effectiveness of the two linguistic hot
 lines-Dutch and French-set up in recent years to assist victims of sexual harass-
 ment. Based on the nature and volume of the calls received, the Ministry deter-
 mined that the hot lines were serving their planned purpose and is continuing them.
 The law prohibits organizing prostitution or assisting immigration for prostitu-
 tion. In 1995 the Government targeted the problem of human trafficking by enacting
 protective measures. For example, work permits for cabaret dancers must be picked
 up in person, at which time a worker may be given a translation of her contract
 in her native language, and a brochure regarding shelters for victims of forced pros-
 titution. Additionally, local government officials may refuse to perform "marriages
 of convenience." Finally, foreign-born -victims may receive a temporary permit to
 stay in Belgium for up to 45 days and may stay longer if they cooperate with police
 to capture the trafficker.
 Children.-Belgium has comprehensive child-protection laws, which the Govern-
 ment enforces effectively. The F orancphone and Flemish communities have agencies
 dealing with children's needs. Government and private groups provide shelters for
 runaways and counseling for children who have been physically or sexually abused.
 Children are the victims of up to 40 percent of rapes reported to the police.
 Children have the right to a voice in court cases that affect them, such as divorce
 proceedings. The law states that a minor "capable of understanding" can request
 p-mission to be heard by a judge, or a judge can request an interview with a child.
 Child prostitution is of limited scope, but, in response to recommendations made
 last year in a government study, police have received instructions to be espeially
 diligent in combating prostitution of those who appear to be under the age of 18.
 There is no pattern of societal abuse directed against children.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against disabled people in
 employment, education, or in the provision of other state services. The Government
 mandates that public buildis erected since 1970 be accessible to the disabled and
 offers subsidies to induce own~rs of other buildings to make necessary modifications.
 Many older buildings, howeVer,are not accessible to the disabled.
 The Government provides uln~acial assistance for the disabled. It offers special
 aid for parents of disabled children and for disabled parents. Regional and commu-
 nity programs provide other assistance, such as job training. In September an ac-
 cord was signed among the three regions which allows handicapped persons to re-
 ceive services in. any of the three regions. Previously, they could receive assistance
 only from the region where they resided.

 National IRaciallEthnic Minorities.-Belgium is a pluralistic society in which in-
 dividual differences in general are respected and linguistic rights in particular are
 protected. Some 60 percent of citizens are native Dutch-speakers; about 40 percent
 e              and fewer than  percent German-speakers.
 An Antiracism Law penalizes incitement of discrimination, hate, or violence based
 on race, ethnicity, or nationality. It is illegal for providers of goods or services (in-
 cluding housing) to dicrmnate on the basis of any of these factors and for employ-
 ers to consider these factors in their decisions to hire, train, or dismiss people.
 The Center for Equal Opportunity and the Fight Agait Racism, a parliamentary
 organization tasked with investigating complaints of discrimination b~ased on race,
 handied 1,020 calls asking for information m the first 6 months of the year. Some
 420 of these calls were to make actual complaints. In the general elections in May,
 the far-right, openly anti-immigrant parties (the Flemish Vlaams Blok, the Walloon
 Front National, and Agir) received 12.3 percent of the vote in Flandrs, 6.3 percent
 in Wallonia, and 11.3 percent in Brussels.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Assciation.-Undr the Constitution, workers have the right to
 associate freely. This includes freedom to organize and join unions of their own
 choosing. The Government does not hamper such activities, and workers in fact fully
 and freely exercise their right of association. About 60 percent are members of labor
 unions. This number includes employed, unemployed, and retired workers. Unions
 are independent of the Government but have important links with major political
 parties. As the Government does not ,require unions to register, there are no prohibi-
 tions against antiunion actions before registration.
 Unions have the right to strike, and strikes by civil servants and workers in "es-
 sential" services are tolerated. The railway workers, airport workers, and air traffic
 controllers held strikes without government intimidation. There were a number of
 significant labor strikes and work stop pages in 1995. (Ministry of Labor data indi-
 catoe there were 49 strikes in 1992; there are no strike numbers available after
 1992.) Even though many strikes begin as wildcat actions, strikers are not pros-
 ecutd for conducting an illegal strie.
 For the first time in recent memory, the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions (ICFITU) in its "Annual Survey of Violations of Trade Union Rights
 1995k noted reports from the two major labor confederations indicating that "the
 right to strike was being increasingly undermined by employers and the judiciary."
 Of concern to the ICFTU was an "increasing tendency over the last few years for
 employers to seek the intervention of the courts in order to ban strikes or break up
 picket lines." It is easier today than it was a few years ago to get a court injunction
 against a strike if it can be shown to a judge's satisfactio"n that violence or an in-
 f "ringe ment of privateproperty has occurred in the course of a strike.
 Unions are free to form or join federations or confederations and are free to affili-
 ate with international labor bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Coaectioely.-The right to organize and
 bargain collectively is recognized, protected, and exercised freely. Every other
 theBelgian Business Federation and union neoiat a     ontowid  te yctvobr
 gmaining agreement, covering 2.4 mllionprivate-sctr workers, that establishes the
 ework for negotiatiions at plants and branches. Public sector workers also nego-
 tiate collective bargaining agreements. Collective bargaining agreements apply
 equally to union and nonunion members, and over 90 percent of workers are under
 collective bargaining agreements. As part of the Government's global economic re-
 form plan, in 1995 wage increases in both private and public sectors were sus-
 pended. This did not affect Belgium's wage indxation policy which permitted a less
 than 2 percent across-the-board wage increase to keep workers' pay level with infla-
 tion.
 The law prhibits discrimination against organizers and members of unions and
 protects against termination of contracts of members of workers' councils, members
 of health or safety committees, and shop stewards. Employers found guilty of
 antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities.
 Effective mechanisms such as the labor courts exist for adjudicating disputes be-
 tween labor and management.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is ille-
 gal and does not occur. Domestic workers and all other workers have the same
 rights as nondomestic workers. The Government enforces laws against those who
 seek to employ undocumented foreign workers.
 d. Minimum Age for Employnent of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 of chldren is 15, but schooling is compulsory until the age of 18. Youth between
 
 
 the ages of 15 and 18 may participate in part-time work/part-time study programs
 but may not work full time except on limited duration summer-labor contracts of
 u p to 30 days. During that period, they can work the same numrber of hours as
 adults. The labor courts efectively monitor ornpliance with national laws and
 standards. There are no industries where any significant child labor exists.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In June the monthly national minimum wage
 rate for workers over 21 was set at $1,494 (43,318 Belgian franca); 18-year-olda can
 be paid 82 percent of the minimum, 19-year-olds 88 percent, and 20-year-olds 94
 percent. The minimum wage rate, coupled with Belgium's extensive social benefits,
 provides workers with a standard of iving appropriate to a highy developed nation.
 Minimum wages in the private sector are set in biennial nationwide collective bar-
 gaining (see  eion 6.b.), which leads to formal agreements signed in the National
 Labor Council and made mandatory by royal decree for the entire private sector.
 In the public sector, the minimum wage is determined in negotiations between the
 Government and the public-service unions. The Ministry of Labor effectively en-
 forces the law regarding minimum wages. By law, the standard workweek cannot
 exceed 40 hours and must have at least one 24-hour rest period. Many collective
 bargaining agreements set standard workweeks of 36 to 39 hours. The law requires
 overtime pay for hours worked in excess of the standard. Work done from the 9th
 to the 11th our per day or from the 40th to the 50th hour per week is considered
 allowable overtime. Longer workdays are permitted only if agreed upon in a collec-
 tive bargaining agreement. These laws/regulations are effectively enforced by the
 Ministry of Labor and the labor courts.
 Comprehensive provisions for worker safety are mandated by law. Collective bar-
 gining agreements can supplement these laws. Workers have the right to remove
 I eeves from situations that endanger their safety or health, without jeopardy
 to their continued employment, and the law protects workers who file complaints
 about such situations. The Labor Ministry implements health and safety legislation
 through a team of inspectors and determines whether workers qualify for disability
 and medical benefits. Health and safety committees are mandated by law in compa-
 nies with more than 50 employees and by works councils in companies with more
 than 100 employees. Labor courts momtor effectively compliance with national
 health and safety laws and standards.
