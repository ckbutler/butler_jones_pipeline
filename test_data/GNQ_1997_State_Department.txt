 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 Equatorial Guinea is nominally a multiparty constitutional republic but in reality
 power is exercised by President .Teodoro, Obiang Nguema through -a small subclan
 of the majority Fang tribe which has ruled since the country's-independence in 1968.
 -President Obiang was elected to a 7-year term in February 1996. in.elections that
 were- marred by extensive fraud and intimidation. The President's Democratic Party
 of Equatorial Guinea (PDGE) controls the judiciary and the legislature, the latter
 also through fraudulent elections.
 President.Obiang exercises control over the police and security forces through the
 Minister of the Interior, who serves as president of the national electoral board as
 - well. The security-forces -committed numerous, serious human rights abuses.
 The majority of the population of-approximately 400,000 live by subsistence agri-
 culture, supplemented by hunting and fishing. Barter is a major aspect of the econ-
 omy,-and the small monetary sector is based on exports of petroleum, cocoa, and
 timber. Most foreign economic assistance has been suspended due to the lack of eco-
 _,nomic. reform-and the Government's. repeated violations of human. rights. Substan-
 tial nil deposits were discovered in 1995, and exploitation -began in 1996. However,
 the investment-and -other -use of oil revenues remains a closed process despite re-
 peated calls from financial institutions -and citizens for financial openness. The
 country's economic potential continues to be undermined by poor fiscal management
 and a lack of transparency in public finance. A National Economic Conference held
 in Bata allowed public debate on the use of oil revenues for the first time.
 The Government's human rights record remained poor. Serious and systematic
 human rights abuses continued although there were improvements in some areas.
 Citizens, do not have the right to change their government. Principal abuses by the
 security forces included: Physical abuse of prisoners; torture; beating of detainees;
 arbitrary arrest anddetention; extortion from prisoners; searches without warrants,
 and confiscation of property without due process. Officials generally took no action
 against security force members suspected of human rights-abuses. There was one
 report of extrajudicial killing, security force members involved in this killing were
 tried, convicted, and sentenced to jail terms. Prison conditions remained life threat-
 
 
 ening. The judicial system does not ensure due process and is subject to executive
 influence. The Government somewhat loosened its severe restrictions on freedom of
 speech and the press. It permitted the establishment of independent newspapers
 and in August hosted an international press seminar. The Government continues,
 however, to restrict the right of assembly, and does not always respect the right "of
 association. Discrimination and violence against women and oreigners remain seri-
 ous problems. Discrimination against minorities, particularly the Bubi minority,
 persists.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and  Other Ext rajudicial Killing.-There was one confirmed
 extrajudicial killing. On January 22, police arrested political activist Evaristo Abaha
 in the Rio Muni town of Evinayong. They took him to a police station, bound him,
 and tortured him to death. The Government initially denied the killing, and claimed
 that the opposition had fabricated the incident to discredit the Government. The
 Government later acknowledged the incident, tried and sentenced those responsible,
 but only after Abaha's death had received wide attention in the international press
 and had triggered intense criticism by opposition parties, which were then in a dia-
 logue with the Government over a new national pact intended to curb such abuses.
 In November a series of at least 13 killings involving mutilation of victims occurred
 in Malabo and Bata. The killings were reportedly carried out by street thugs operat-
 ing under the protection of police authorities. Several suspects were reportedly ar-
 rested but escaped from prison.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The level of these abuses is serious, but they are less frequent and widespread than
 during the previous year. The police do beat detainees severely. In May police ar-
 rested and detained opposition party members in Niefang who reportedly suffered
 torture (see Section 1.d.). Access to persons in custody is not generally permitted.
 Police routinely stop members of the opposition at roadblocks and subject them to
 search and extortion scams. Local authorities also singled out foreigners from neigh-
 boring countries for harassment, intimidation, and extortion.
 Two police officers accused of the death by torture of activist Evaristo Abaha,
 were convicted and sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment (see Section 1.a.).
 Prison conditions are primitive and life threatening. Rations are inadequate, and
 sanitary conditions practically nonexistent. Female prisoners are housed separately
 from men.
 Prison conditions are monitored by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
 (ICRC), which makes recommendations to the Government. However, the ICRC's re-
 marks and recommendations are not released. At the Government's insistence, they
 remain restricted to the ICRC, the Government, and the local Red Cross, which is
 charged with implementing the recommendations. There were credible reports that
 the suggested changes, such as providing cells with cement floors and allowing pris-
 oners access to clean water, led to mild improvements in otherwise filthy conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-There are nominal but unenforced legal
 procedural safeguards regarding detention, the requirement for search warrants,
 and other protection of citizens' rights. These safeguards are systematically ignored
 by security forces.
 Police routinely hold prisoners in incommunicado detention. The security forces
 arrested members of the opposition and held them for extended periods without a
 hearing. Foreigners from neighboring countries are sometimes targeted for arbitrary
 mistreatment and random arrest. These include visitors from Nigeria, Ghana, Togo,
 and Benin. Members of the security forces often resorted to these crimes in order
 to extort money prior to national holidays.
 There were no reports of long-term political detainees. However, during the year,
 the Government arrested political activists and detained them without charge for
 periods of up to 10 weeks or longer, while they were at times interrogated, beaten,
 and tortured (see Section 1.c.). The Government uses the psychological effects of ar-
 rest, along with the fear of future beating and intimidation, to intimidate opposition
 party members.
 In January Convergencia Para La Democracia Social (CPDS) party members
 Placido Miko and Indalecio Abuy were arrested at CPDS headquarters in Mbini for
 allegedly holding an illegal political meeting. The two were taken to the local police
 station and initially detained for 3 hours. When 15 party members went to the po-
 lice station to inquire as to the charges, police arrested them as well, and held them
 in detention for 1 day. Miko and Abuy were then driven to Bata and released the
 
 
 100
 following day. In May Abuy was again jailed and interrogated for several days (see
 Section 2.d.).
 In July police raided a private home in Bata and arrested 14 members of the
 CPDS for holding an illegal meeting. Although the police never charged the 14
 members with crimes, they were fined $35 each. Only one person had the money
 to pay the fie; the others spent 1 week in detention.
 In May Partido Del Progreso (PP) opposition leader Sever Mote purchased arms
 in Angola and attempted to import them for use in overthrowingthe President. The
 plot was uncovered by Agolan authorities. The Government then launched a na-
 tionwide crackdown on the PP and another opposition group, the Fuerza
 Democratica Republicana (FDR), as yet unrecognized by the Government as an offi-
 cial opposition party. Some 30 members of the FDR were arrested in Rio Muni on
 suspicion of having played a role in the attempted arms shipment. The same inci-
 dent sparked the arrest of 47 members of the P P in Niefang. Three other PP party
 members were arrested in Bata. Credible sources reporte that the detainees in
 Niefang suffered torture.
 In August the Government arrested 20 FDR sympathizers and placed them in
 metal ship containers in Bata, where they reportedly were beaten and tortured.
 They were released after 2 weeks. The Government also arrested a journalist on Au-
 gust 22, placed him with the others in the ship containers, and reportedly tortured
 De or 1 week through repeated beatings on the feet with a belt.
 On November 18, the Government arrested four members of the Bubi tribe at
 Baney for-allegedly being members of the unrecognized Movement for the Auto-De-
 - termination of. the Biolo Island. They remained detained at Blackbeach prison at
 yeaes end.
 In November the Government arrested five Union Popular activists and held them
 without charges at year's end.
 In December, the Government arrested and mistreated three PP members in
 Bata. They may have been released from custody by year's end.
 For the first time, however, the Government prosecuted and punished individual
 members of the security forces who were responsible for extrajudicial killing, tor-
 tre, illegal arrest, and detention. Two police officers, accused of the death by tor-
 t-re of  v sta Abaha, were convicted and sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment.
 The Government does not forceeits citizens into exile, but some persons who were
 able to travel abroad have sought political asylum. During government raids and
 arrests around the Rio Muni town of Mongomo, several dozen individuals reportedly
 fled to Gabon to escape arrest.
 Opposition figure Celestino Bacale, who had fled the countr in December 1996
 afterlbeing charged with insulting the President, returned to Malabo in December
 .without any action by authorities. At year's end, it was unclear whether the 1996
 charge of insulting the President was still active or had been dropped by authorities.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is not independent; judges serve at
 the pleasure of the President and are appointed, transferred, and dismissed for po-
 litical reasons. Corruption is rampant.
 The court system is composed of lower provincial courts, two appeals courts, and
 a Supreme Court. The President appoints members of the Supreme Court, who re-
 port to him. There are also traditional courts in the countryside, in which tribal el-
 ders adjudicate civil claims and minor criminal matters.
 The Constitotion and laws passed by the Chamber of Deputies provide for legal
 representation and the right to appeal. In practice, authorities often do not respect
 these provisions. Civil cases rarely come to public trial.
 In August a three-judge tribunal tried and condemned in absentia accused coup
 plotter Severo Mote and sentenced him to 101 years in prison. The tribunal also
 passed down sentences of 36 years for three Spanish citizens implicated in the re
 The tribunal also dissolved the PP, whose leader, Severe Mote, had attempted to
 import weapons for a coup, although party leaders allege that the coup attempt was
 an individual initiative and not a party effort (see Section 1.d.). The Government
 and the court again acted illegally ,as the judiciary is not empowered under law to
 abolish political parties.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government does not enforce the law requiring judicial warrants for searches. Secu-
 rity forces regularly search homes and arrest occupants, but generally do so without
 warrants. data police reportedly did not have a warrant during a July raid on a
 CPDS meeting.
 The Government launched major urban renewal campaigns in Bata and Malabe.
 A government commission notified owners to rebuild or repaint houses and build-
 ings deemed deficient or unsightly. It gave residents 15 days to comply with the re-
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 101
 quest. Some persons who failed to improve their property as ordered had their prop-
 erty razed by the Government without compensation. There was no appeal of the
 commission's determinations. Foreigners, especially those who did not understand
 the process such as visitors from Cameroon and Nigeria, were hardest hit.
 The Government does not overtly force officials to join the PDGE. However, for
 lawyers, government employees, and some others, PDGE party membership is nec-
 essary for employment and promotion. Even in the private sector, many citizens
 claim that party membership is necessary in order to be hired. The party banner
 is prominently displayed with the national flag in government offices, and many of-
 ficials wear PDGE lapel pins.
 The Governor of Ebibeyin district reportedly enrolled the entire adult population
 into the PDGE by collecting the names of those residing in the district and adding
 them to the party roster without their consent.
 There is reportedly surveillance of members of the opposition parties and foreign
 diplomats.
 Credible sources state that citizens living in rural areas are hesitant to associate
 with, or even be seen with foreigners, due to the fear of repercussions from govern-
 ment authorities.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and the Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of
 speech and of the press, but the Government severely restricts these rights in prac-
 tice, although somewhat less severely than in past years. During the year, the Gov-
 ernment showed more tolerance of free press criticism. It legalized the national
 press association and supported an international press seminar in Malabo in Au-
 gust. A private press began publishing intermittently in 1996 and continued during
 the year. The Government allows mild criticism of infrastructure, public institu-
 tions, and government mismanagement and permitted some increased criticism of
 minor administrative decisions. The Government, however, permits no criticism of
 the President or the security forces. All journalists must be registered with the Min-
 istry of Information. According to press sources, there are five or six independent
 reporters registered with the Ministry of Information. Between 30 and 40 reporters
 employed by the official party or government publications are also registered. Visit-
 ing foreign reporters must be accompanied by guides from the Ministry of Informa-
 tion.
 The Ministry of Information sometimes requires publishers to submit copy for ap-
 proval prior to publication. All local publications exercise self-censorship, and are
 subject to prior restraint. The newspaper El Sol alleged that the Government caused
 frequent interruptions in electricity and other utility services at its offices; however,
 at year's end, it was unclear whether the alleged nterrptions continued, and the
 newspaper had not published for months due to a lack of paper. Some foreign publi-
 cations are available for sale, although security forces reportedly peruse the con-
 tents of publications from Spain and confiscate literature critical of the Government.
 Outdated copies of Spanish and American newspapers are available to clients of
 prominent hotels. Short wave broadcasts and government-controlled radio and tele-
 vision are available to citizens. Spanish language broadcast transmissions have been
 a source of friction with the Spanish Government.
 Television is government-controlled and broadcast only a few hours per day. Cable
 television is available, broadcasting Cable News Network, MTV, French news, mov-
 ies, and cartoons. The Government generally withholds access to broadcastingby
 the more radical opposition parties, and rarely refers to the opposition in anthg
 but a negative light when broadcasting the news. During the revised national pact
 debate, however, the Government allowed the proceedings to be televised, despite
 the strong criticism expressed against the Government in the proceedings. State-
 controlled national radio, which draws a far wider audience, was not permitted to
 broadcast the debate. Opposition parties do not have access to national radio.
 Ther re no institutions of higher learning, although the Government con-
 strcted several buildings, and se nt c onigts of professors overseas for training.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of assembly; however, the Government restricts this right in practice. Gov-
 ernment authorization must be obtained for meetings of more than 10 persons in
 private homes for discussionsathat the regime considers political. Although the Gov-
 ernment formally abolished permit requirements for party meetings within party
 buildings, in practice opposition parties must inform authorities in order to hold
 gatherings of any kind, regardless of location.
 Gatherings in public places, even small gatherings, are generally observed by se-
 curity forces. The Government requires notification for public events, and routinely
 denies permission to meet, effectively restricting the right of assembly.
 
 
 Although the judiciary lacks the legal authority, it abolished the PP party. Oppo-
 sition parties and El Sol allege that the Government causes frequent electrical and
 other utility interruptions for political reasons.
 On December 22, security forces broke up a meeting of the CPDS in the Rio Muni
 town of Akelayong and arrested 12 party members. They released them after 3
 hours.
 Also on December 22, security forces broke up a Union Popular Party meeting in
 the Rio Muni town of Nkue and arrested Cosma Nsue, the municipal chapter head.
 Nsue was reportedly beaten by his jailers and at year's end remained in detention.
 The Constitution provides for the right of association; however, the Government
 does not always respect this right in practice. Police routinely and systematically
 harass and jail members of opposition parties. Opposition party members com-
 plained of disruption of meetings and roadblocks at which they are forced to pay
 soldiers $30 in order to proceed. In the township of Nkimi, near Niefang, govern-
 ment officials reportedly arrest or intimidate visitors wishing to call on the hamlet's
 opposition party mayor. National government authorities reportedly sabotaged the
 Nkimi municipal government by preventing local authorities from collecting reve-
 nues. Government officials also reportedly stle an estimated $4,000 from the mu-
 nicipal government.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government generally respects freedom of religion.
 However, there were incidents in whichpriests and nuns were arrested and har-
 assed by security forces. Government officials in Bata detained and intimidated
 Spanish nuns as a method of pressuring the government of Spain to issue a greater
 number of visas to influential citizens. In July security forces arrested, jailed, and
 deported a Spanish priest, claiming that he was a spy. Missionaries in Bata and
 Malabo reported little government interference in their work.
 There is no state religion, and the Government does not discriminate against any
 faith. However, the Government continues to restrict freedom of expression for the
 clergy, particularly regarding open criticism of the regime. A religious organization
 must first be formally recognized by the Ministry of Justice and Religion before its
 religious activities are allowed. The significant easing of restrictions on religious ac-
 tivities reported by foreign missionaries in 1996 continued during the year.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-In principle, freedom of movement and travel throughout the country
 are provided for in the law. However, local police routinely demand bribes from oc-
 cupants of cars, taxis, and other vehicles traveling outside the capital. Opposition
 activists complain of harassment at roadblocks. Police routinely stop members of the
 opposition at roadblocks, subject them to searches and extort money from them.
 Members of the Bubi ethnic group on the island of Bioko are unable to move about
 freely, according to credible sources, as the Government fears separatist sympathies.
 Roadblocks throughout the island prevent Bubis from traveling between villages.
 Although all citizens are required to have permission to travel abroad, members
 of opposition parties are regularly denied this permission and may face a hostile re-
 ception upon their return.
 In May political activist Indalecio Abuy was jailed by security officials after dis-
 -embarking from a flight from Malabo. Security forces interrogated him for several
 days.
 Government officials attempt to control the movements of opposition party mem-
 bers through the use of exit visas or confiscation of passports. Those who depart
 Malabo without an exit visa must travel by canoe across 40 miles of open ocean to
 reach mainland Africa, then face possible immigration charges upon their return.
 In June government officials denied the exit visa of CPDS opposition leader Placido
 Miko, who wished to attend a political conference in Europe. Miko eventually de-
 larted Malabo by canoe. After numerous diplomatic appeals to the Government,
 ko returned to.Malabo without incident. At the Malabo airport, government offi-
 cials allegedly confiscated the passport of Eloy Elo Mue Mbengana, founder of the
 unrecognized FDR party. The confiscation led to the cancellation of Elo's travel
 plans. He later departed the country clandestinely by canoe.
 The country closed its land borders with Cameroon and Gabon to its own citizens
 intermittently in June, following an attempt in May byan opposition leader to in-
 vade the country and overthrow the Government (see Section 1.d). There were also
 numerous arrests in Mongomo and Ebibeyin, and citizens were not permitted to de-
 part the country for a period of time. The Government also closed its land borders
 in September and October during the National Conference.
 In July President Obiang told a gathering of foreigners that in the event of a na-
 tional emergency he would not allow foreign governments to repatriate their citi-
 zens. The remark was directed at foreigners whom the President fears may attempt
 to finance destabilization of his Government.
 
 
 There are both refugees and asylum seekers. According to a credible source, some
 20 refugees from Liberia, Rwanda, Sudan, and Mauritania have sought political asy-
 lum in Equatorial Guinea. The Government generally grants these requests. Most
 foreigners seeking asylum, however, however, do not eclare themselves refugees.
 On November 5, during a visit by President Obiang to Gabon, Gabonese authori-
 ties there arrested two Equatoguinean citizens and surrendered them to
 Equatoguinean security forces who involuntarily repatriated them. Both were reg-
 istered with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees as refugees.
 There were no first asylum cases during the year.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution nominally provides citizens with the right to change their gov-
 ernment peacefully, but in fact there have been no free, fair, and transparent presi-
 dential elections since independence in 1968. The President exercises complete
 power as Head of State commander of the armed forces and leader of the govern-
 ment party, the PDGE. Leadership positions within the dovernment are, in general,
 restricted to the President's subclan and closest supporters. While there is an elect-
 ed Chamber of Deputies, it is not representative and is dominated by the Govern-
 ment. The Minister of the Interior also acts as president of the national electoral
 board.
 The February 1996 presidential election, in which, President Obiang claimed re-
 election victory with 98 percent of the vote, was considered openly fraudulent by
 international observers. Sme opposition politicians who campaigned were beaten
 and jailed. Voting was done in the open and without secrecy, with opposition parties
 allegedly being barred from access to polling areas. There were creaible reports of
 widespread arrests and violence against opposition party members before the elec-
 tions, as well as of beatings roadblocks, stuffed ballot boxes, and open voting the
 presence of security forces. Most opposition parties, claiming that it was futile to
 run amidst such blatant corruption, boycotted the elections.
 In April the Government and 13 political parties promulgated a revised national
 pact following 3 months of debate. The pact calls for the creation of a multiparty
 Electoral Commission and an Observance Commission to monitor compliance with
 the agreement. The pact also stipulated an end to various political and electoral
 abuses and the extension of voting rights already nominally provided for in the Con-
 stitution. However, the Government has yet to abide by any of the pact's provisions.
 Oppositions activists report that the Government has made no effort to implement
 the pact. The Government's refusal to issue exit visas to opposition figures violates
 the pact's principle of freedom of travel. The continued arrests of CPDS, PP, and
 FDIT activists further undermined the Government's claims that it abides by the
 pact, as do its continued restrictions on freedom of movement and the continued
 lack of access to government media by the op position. During the debate on the na-
 tional pact, one opposition figure was assaulted by government security forces after
 meeting with a foreign diplomat. The Government excluded the CPDS party from
 the national pact dialog when the party failed to attend the opening session, but
 independent sources asserted that the Government deliberately barred the CPDS
 because it feared the party's strength. The CPDS, however, participates in the pacts
 Observance Commission. The nominally multiparty Electoral Commission was not
 functioning at year's end.
 Although there are no legal restrictions on the participation of women in politics,
 women remain seriously underrepresented in government positions. There are 2
 women in the 42-member Cabinet, and 5 in the 8o-member legislature.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no effective local human rights nongovernmental organizations. Am-
 nesty International has no permanent presence in the country. The Government
 does not recognize its reports or acknowledge their credibility.
 The United Nations Special Rapporteur for Human Rights visited in December
 1996 and received the Government's cooperation.
 The Government established a Parliamentary Commission on Human Rights ap-
 proximately 5 years ago. This organization, however, has rarely been heard from,
 and has little credibility or influence.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 While the Constitution condenis all forms of discrimination, both governmental
 and societal discrimination continue. These are reflected in traditional constraints
 on women's education and in restricted opportunities for professional and occupa-
 
 
 104
 tional achievement by ethnic minorities. The Government deliberately limits poten-
 tial opportunities for ethnic minorities.
 Women.-Societal violence against women, particularly wife beating, is common.
 Public beating of wives is forbidden by government decree, but violence in the home
 is enerally tolerated. The Government does not prosecute perpetrators of domestic
 violence.
 Although the Constitution provides for equal rights, women are largely confined
 by custom to traditional roles, particularly in agriculture. Polygyny, which is wide-
 spread among the Fang, contributes to womens secondary status, as does limited
 educational opportunity. On average women receive only one-fifth as much schooling
 as men.
 There is no discrimination against women with regard to inheritance and family
 laws, but there is discrimination in traditional practice. For an estimated 90 percent
 of women, including virtually all ethnic groups except the Bubi, tradition dictates
 that if a marriage is dissolved, the wife must return the dowry given her family by
 the bridegroom at the time of. marriage, while the husband automatically receives
 custody of all children born after the marriage. The mother maintains custody of
 all children born prior to marriage.
 Similarly, in the Fang, Ndowe, and Bisio cultures, primogeniture is practiced, and
 as women become members of their husband's family upon marriage, they usually
 are not accorded inheritance rights. According to the law, women have the right to
 buy and sell property and goods, but in practice the male-dominated society permits
 few women access to sufficient funds to engage in more than petty trading or to pur-
 chase real property beyond a garden plot or modest home.
 Children.-There are no legislated provisions for the welfare of children. The Gov-
 ernment devotes little attention to children's rights or their welfare, and has no set
 policy in this area. The education of Bubi children is virtually ignored by the Gov-
 ernment. Education is compulsory up to the age of 18, but the Government does not
 enforce the law.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no constitutional or legal provision for the
 physically disabled with respect to discrimination in employment or education.
 There is no legislation mandating accessibility for the disabled to buildings or gov-
 ernment services.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-There is no legal discrimination against eth-
 nic or racial minorities, and the Government does not overtly limit their participa-
 tion; however, the monopolization of political power by the President's Mongomo
 subclan of the Fang ethnic group persists. In practice some members of minorities
 face discrimination because they are not members of the Fang ethnic group, or be-
 long to a subelan other than the President's. Minorities do not face discrimination
 in inheritance, marriage, or family laws.
 Several thousand citizens of Nigeria, Ghana, and Francophone Africa continue to
 reside in the country. Most are small traders and business people. There are numer-
 ous reports of their harassment by the police (see Section 1.d.).
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Although the Constitution provides for the right to
 organize umions, the Government has not passed enabling legislation. A 1995 peti-
 tion by service sector employees to form a union in the mainland capital of Bata
 has yet to be answered by the Government. In the small wage economy, no labor
 union exists, although there are a few cooperatives with limited power. The law pro-
 hibits strikes. The Labor Code contains prvisions to uphold worker rights, but the
 Government generally does not enforce them.
 It is generally acknowledged that membership in the PDGE is a prerequisite for
 hiring and promotion, both in the public and private sectors. Membership in a rival
 political organization is considered grounds for dismissal from any position, public
 or private. Opposition politicians often claim to have been dismissed from their jobs
 after joining alternate political groups. During the 1996 presidential elections, sev-
 eral large private employers reportedly threatened to dismiss workers who did not
 vote forPresident Obiang.
 Hring by the oil industry, one of the country's major employers, is largely con-
 trolled by the Government, which oprates through an agency, APEGESA. Inde-
 pendent sources onfirm that APEGESA, in sreening applicants for positions, ex-
 cludes those whom it considers unfriendly or indifferent to the PDGE. APEGESA
 reportedly keeps nearly two-thirds of employees' wages. Oil workers earning $47 per
 day reportedly receive only $16; the remainder is kept by APEGESA, which is alleg-
 edy managedby the Minister of Mines and Energy. When several employees signed
 a petition complaining of this treatment, they were fired.
 The Government did not allow unions to affiliate internationally.
 
 
 105
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no legislation regard-
 ing these rights or prohibiting antiunion discrimination. There is no evidence of col-
 lective bargaining by any group. Wages are set by the Government and employers,
 with little or no participation hy the workers. Employers must pay the mnimum
 wages set by the Government, and 'most companies pay more than the government-
 established minimum.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law forbids forced or bonded
 labor and slavery, and there were no reports that these activities took place. Con-
 victed felons do, within the law, perform extensive labor outside prison without com-
 pensation.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Eiployment.-The labor
 code prohibits forced or bonded labor by children, and there were no reports that
 it exists (see Section 6.c.). The legal minimum age for child employment is 18 years,
 but the Ministry of Labor does notenforce thislaw. The Government also does not
 enforce the law that stipulates mandatory education up to the age of 18. Underage
 youth perform both family farm work and street vending.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law prescribes a standard 35-hour work-
 week an      a  -our rest period which are observed in practice in the formal econ-
 omy. The minimum monthly wage is approximately $44 (cfa 27,000). The minimum
 wage does not provide for a decent standard of living for a worker and family. The
 Labor Code provides for comprehensive protection for workers from occupational
 hazards; however, the Government does not enforce this in practice. Employees who
 protest unhealthy or dangerous working conditions risk losing their jobs.
