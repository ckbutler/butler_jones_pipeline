 INDONESIA
 The Indonesian political system, despite a surface adherence to democratic forms,
 remains strongly authoritarian. President Soeharto, now in his sixth 5-year term,
 a small group of advisers, and the military dominate the political life of this heavily
 populated developing country, whose people come from hundreds of different cul-
 tural, linguistic, and ethnic backgrounds. The Government requires allegiance to a
 state ideology known as "Pancasila," which includes belief in a supreme god, a just
 and civilized humanity, national unity, democracy, and social justice. It has used
 Pancasila as a justification for restricting the development of opposition elements.
 Under a doctrine of "dual function," the miltary is gven special civic rights and
 responsibilities, including unelected military seats in~arliament (DPR) and local
 legilatures, in addition to its defense and security roles. The 450,000-member
 armed forces, including 175,000 police, consider the maintenance of internal security
 as their primary mission, and they have traditionally acted swiftly to suppress per-
 ceived threats to security, whether from criminal acts, separatist movements, or al-
 legedly subversive activities, with a vigor that has often led to human rights abuses.
 A few military leaders sometimes raised questions about the validity of this "secu-
 rity approach." There continued to be numerous, credible reports of human rights
 abuses by the military and police, although they exhibited some restraint in control-
 ling crowds and demonstrations.
 T, contrast to its restrictive political system, Indonesia has an increasingly open
 and deregulated economy. Though still a poor country, Indonesia's economy contin-
 ued to expand in 1994, especially in manufacturing, with gross domestic product ex-
 
 
 592
 peed to increase by 6.7 percent. With inflation remaining under control, the con-
 tinued economic growth has produced steady gains in living standards for much of
 Indonesian society. The number of people livng below the poverty line has fallen
 from 70 million in 1970 to 27 million in 1990. Income inequality has been slightly
 reduced over the past quarter century. Widespread unemployment persists, how-
 ever, as do corruption and influence peddling.
 The Government continued to commit serious human rights abuses and in some
 areas, notably freedom of expression, it became markedly more repressive, departing
 from a long-term trend towards greater openness. The most serious abuses included
 the continuing inability of the people to change their government and harsh repres-
 sion of East Timorese dissidents. Reports of extrajudicial killings declined. Security
 forces continued to torture those in custody: some sources reported that the use of
 torture declined, but definitive statistics are not available. Extrvjudicial arrests and
 detentions continued, as did the use of excessive violence in dealing with suspected
 criminals or perceived troublemakers.
 The Government imposed severe limitations on freedoms of speech, press, and as-
 sembly, and suppressed efforts to develop a free trade union movement. The armed
 forces continued to be responsible for the most serious human rights abuses. Some
 miitary leaders showed a wiingnss to admit misconduct pubicly and take action
 against offenders. The Government in a few cases brought abusers to justice, but
 their punishment rsrely matched the severity of the abuse. The judiciary continued
 to be largely subservient to the executive branch and the military. Widespread cor-
 ruption in the legal system remained a serious problem.
 The Government withdrew the licenses of th~ree leading publications. It prepared
 but has not issued a draft presidential decree that would restrict further the activi-
 ties of nongovernmental organizations (NGO's), and it increasingly cracked down on
 antigovernmental critics, labor activists, and alleged criminals during the year, in-
 cluding in an anticrime campaign dubbed "Operation Cleanup" by the Government.
 These constraints, however, did not completely dampen dissenting voices in the
 media, and the many human rights NGO's continued to be active. The government-
 appointed National Human Rights Commission established in 1993 showed some
 independence and a willingness to criticize government policies and actions.
 On East Timor, no progress was made in accounting for the missing persons fol-
 lowing the 1991 Dili incident, and troop levels remained unjustifiably high. Some-
 what greater access was permitted to foreign journalists and others, including a
 July visit by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Summary, Arbitrary and
 Extra-judicial Executions, although some NO representatives and foreign journal-
 ists continued to encounter difficulties or were demed access to East Timer.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killings.-Historically, politically motivated
 extrajudicial killings generally have occurred most frequently in areas where sepa-
 ratist movements were active, such as East Timor, Aceh, and Irian Jaya. Although
 security forces continue to employ harsh measures against separatist movements in
 these three areas, there were no confirmed reports of politically motivated
 extrajudicial killings in 1994.
 However there were reports of security forces killing armed insurgents including
 six Aceh Merdeka supporters in clashes in Aceh. At least four members of the secu-
 rity forces were also reported killed in these clashes. Reliable civilian sources re-
 ported that in East Timor security forces killed several Timorese civilians. The num-
 her of such reports was lower than in previous years, however. There were no re-
 ports of such killings in Irian Jaya.
 Troop strength in East Timor declined in 1994. Reliable estimates indicated that
 about 6,000 army troops from outside the province reinforced the normal garrison
 of about 3,000. There are also about 3,000 police in East Timor. Commanders there
 have stated that they intend to review the level of troops in the province for possible
 further reductions on a twice yearly basis. The Government offered a general am-
 nesty to members of the Timorese resistance who surrender their arms, and it was
 reported to have released some who were apprehended rather than trying them.
 The police often employ excessive force in apprehending suspects or coping with
 alleged criminals. In Jakarta police in April mounted an anticrime program dubbed
 "Operation Cleanup," in which they employed deadly force against suspects. In re-
 sponse to protests that the methods used are uijustifiably harsh and amount to exe-
 cution without trial police have generally claimed that the suspects were fleeing,
 resisting arrest, or threatening the police. Although accurate statistics were unavail-
 able, the number of fatal shootings by police seemed to be increasing, with some 150
 
 
 593
 incidents reported in West Java (including Jakarta) by mid-July. Human rights
 groups were particularly concerned that this cleanup campaign was intensified in
 the weeks leading up to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) meet-
 ing in November. In North Sumatra, 80 shootings by police, including 4 deaths,
 were reported by mid-December.
 In the past the authorities almost never took action against police for using exces-
 sive force. However, there is some indication that the situation is improving, al-
 though action taken by the authorities is still not commensurate with the gravity
 of police abuses. For example, a military court in Medan sentenced a policeman ac-
 cused of killing a suspect in 1993, who was allegedly trying to escape, to 3 months
 in prison in 1994. In March a military court sentenced four policemen in Palembang
 to prison terms of 2 to 3 months for shooting, but not killing, a suspect at close
 range. The five police officers detained in 1993 in North Sumatra in connection with
 the death of Syamsul Bahri were not tried1 apparently because the family did not
 pursue the case. At least one of the 10 police cadets accused of beating a man to
 ieath in Ku     in    il was sentenced to 2 years in prison. At year's end the mili-
 tary clamedto be still investigating the September 1993 killings by security forces
 of four demonstrators who were peacefully protesting construction of a dam in
 Madura; some two dozen police and military personnel are involved. Residents from
 the area met with representatives of the National Human Rights Commission in
 May and December to request legal action against civilians and military personnel
 accused of involvement in the shootings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no politically motivated abductions. Security forces
 in areas of conflict often hold suspects for Iong periods without formal charges, but
 these cases usually end with official acknowledgement of detention (see Section
 1.d.). Reliable sources report that all those alleged to have disappeared during the
 mid-July disturbances at the University of East Timor have been located.
 Government efforts to account for the missing and dead from the November 12,
 1991 military shooting of civilians in Dili, East Timor, remained inadequate. No ad-
 ditional cases of those still listed as missing in a report the military gave to Human
 Rights Watch/Asia were resolved during the year. Government spokesmen implied
 that their failure to locate those missing was primarily due to those persons wishing
 to evade detection. Many knowledgeable observers, however, continued to believe
 that most of the missing are dead and that some members of the armed forces know
 where their bodies are located.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Criminal Code makes it a crime punishable by up to 4 years in prison for any
 official to use violence or force to elicit a confession, and it establishes pretrial proce-
 dures to give suspects or their families the right to challenge the legality of an ar-
 rest or detention. In practice, security forces continued to employ torture and other
 forms of mistreatment, particularly in regions of security concerns such as Aceh and
 East Timor, although some sources reported that the use of torture declined. Legal
 protections are both inadequate and widely ignored. According to the January 1994
 report of the Special Rapporteur on Torture to the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission, the most commonly used methods are: beating on the head, shins, and
 torso with fists, lengths of wood, iron bars, bottles, rocks, and electric cables; kicking
 with heavy boots; burning with lighted cigarettes; electric shocks; slashing with
 razor blades and knives; death threats, faked executions and deliberate wounding
 with firearms- pouring water through the nose; prolonged immersion in fetid water;,
 hanging upside down by the feet; placing heavy objects on knees and other joints;
 isolation; sleep and food deprivation and genital mutilation, sexual molestation, and
 rape. Civilian sources in East Timor report that security agencies still employ tor-
 ture before releasing suspects to police custody, particularly electric shocks, though
 its incidence has decreased.
 Police often resort to physical abuses even in minor incidents, andprison condi-
 tions are harsh, with violence among prisoners and mistreatment and extortion of
 inmates by guards reportedly common. The incidence of mistreatment by prison offi-
 cials drops sharply once a prisoner has been transferred from police or military cus-
 tody into the civilian prison system, and prison conditions generally have improved
 in recent years. Officials have publicly condemned police brutality and harsh prison
 conditions and occasionally instigate disciplinary action, including transfer, dismis-
 sal, and trials leading to prison. In August a civilian employed at a Medan jail was
 tried on charges of causing the death ofan inmate who didfrom. inuries sustained
 in a beating. He was sentenced to 6 months in jail. Such actions, however, are an
 exception to the rule of general impunity.
 Political prisoners are usually mixed with the general prison population, although
 in the Cipinang prison in Jakarta high-profile political prisoners are segregated. In
 1994 the Government allowed the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 
 
 594
 to visit prisoners in Cipinang in Jakarta and also granted access to prisons else-
 where in Java Sumatra, Aceh, and other provinces as well as East Timor. The Gov-
 ernment also has allowed the ICRC to organize family visits to political prisoners.
 In January the authorities suspended visitation rights for jailed East Timorese
 Fretilin leader Xanana Gusmao for 1 month following release of a letter he sent to
 the International Commission of Jurists which Indonesian authorities deemed objec-
 tionable.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Criminal Procedures Code contains
 provisions against arbitrary arrest and detention which are routinely violated. The
 Code specifies the right of prisoners to notify their families, and that warrants must
 be produced durg an arrest except under specified onditions, such as when a sus-
 pect is caught in the at of committing a crime. It also authorizes investigators to
 issue warrants to assist in their investigations or if sufficient evidence exists that
 a crime has been committed. Despite these requirements, authorities sometimes
 make arrests without warrants. Some persons suspected of involvement in the
 Medan riots in April were arrested before formal warrants were issued.
 The law presumes defendants innocent and permits bail. They or their families
 may also challenge the legality of their arrest and detention in a pretrial hearing
 andmy sue for compensation if wrongfully detained. However, it is virtually impos-
 sible for detainees to invoke this procedure, let alone receive compensation, after
 being released without charge. In beth military and civilian courts, appeals based
 on legality of arrest and detention are rarely, if ever, accepted. The Code also con-
 tains specific limits on periods of pretrial detention and specifies when the courts
 must get involved to approve extensions, usually after 60 days.
 In areas where active guerrilla movements exist, such as East Timor and Aceh
 people are routinely detained without warrants, charges, or court proceedings. Bail
 is rarely granted, especially in political cases. The authorities frequently prevent ac-
 cess to defense counsel and make it difficult or impossible for detainees to $et legal
 assistance from voluntary legal defense organizations. The authorities routinely ap-
 prove extensions of periods of detention. In addition, suspects charged under the
 1963 Antisubversion Law are subject to special procedures outside the Criminal Pro-
 cedures Code which allow, for example, the Attorney General the authority to hold
 a suspect up to 1 year before trial. He may renew this 1-year period without limit.
 Special laws on corruption, economic crimes, and narcotics are similarly exempt
 from the Code's protections.
 The Agency for Coordination of Assistance for the Consolidation of National Secu-
 rity (BAKORSTANAS) operates outside the Code and has wide discretion to detain
 and interrogate persons thought to threaten national security. It is impossible to
 state the exact number of arbitrary arrests or detentions without trial but in March
 59 people being held in connection with the 1989-91 Aceh insurgency were released
 without charges or trials, bringing the total number released since 1990 to around
 965 persons. Many had been held incommunicado without knowing the charges
 against them; some, including at least five of those released in 1994, had been held
 for over 2 years. The authorities require many of those released to report back at
 regular intervals. Three other Acehnese convicted previously of subversion were re-
 leased in 1994 after serving two-thirds of their sentences. The decline in armed sep-
 aratist activity led to fewer detentions, and fewer than 100 Acehnese were believed
 to be in detention without trial at year's end. An additional five persons were sen-
 tenced for subversion in Aceh in 1994, and the trials of five others on charges of
 subversion and narcotics smuggling were scheduled to begin in mid-December.
 In East Timer military authorities continued the practice of detaining people
 without charges for short periods and then requiring them to report daily or weekly
 to police after their release. Three East Timorese students detained by police in Au-
 gust for bringing forbidden books and foreign items into the province were released,
 but two of them are required to report to the authorities. Six East Timorese who
 received lengthy sentences in connection with the November 1991 shootings in Dili
 were transferred to the maximum security prison in Semarang without prior notice
 to their families or humanitarian organizations, and their whereabouts were un-
 known for several days. Jose Antonio Neves, an acknowledged member of the clan-
 destine proindependence movement, and in detention since May, was charged with
 sedition in September. His defense attorney asked for dismissal of the charges, cit-
 ing procedural flaws in Neves' arrest. They also allege that police denied him access
 to legal representation for the first 2 months of his detention. Around 100 people
 were arrested during demonstrations and outbreaks of violence in Dili around the
 time of the November APEC meetings. Some remained in custody at year's end.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-The Constitution stipulates the independence of
 the judiciary but in practice the judiciary is subordinated to the executive and the
 military, and in many cases procedural protections, including those against coerced
 
 
 595
 confessions, are inadequate to ensure a fair trial. A quadripartite judiciary of gen-
 eral, religious, military, and administrative courts exists below the Supreme Court.
 The right of appeal from district court to high court to Supreme Court exists in all
 four systems of justice. The Supreme Court does not consider factual aspects of a
 case, only the lower courts' application of law. A three-judge panel conducts trials
 at the district court level poses questions, hears evidence, ecides guilt or inno-
 cence, and assesses punisbment. Initial judgments are rarely reversed in the ap-
 peals pro  s, although sentences are sometimes increased or reduced (both the de-
 nsa       theprosecution may appeal). In 1994 for example the 4-year sentence of
 a student tried in Jakarta for insulting the President in leaflets he distributed near
 the Parliament in November 1993 was increased to 5 years upon appeal of the pros-
 ecutor. The relatively light (6 months) sentences of 21 other students who were also
 convicted of insulting the President during demonstrations at Parliament in Decem-
 ber 1993 were increased to between 8 and 14 months following appeal by the pros-
 ecutor. In August the Supreme Court ordered the release of those among the 21 stu-
 dents whose sentences had been raised to 8 months when they were still being held
 a week following completion of their sentences.
 Defendants have the right to confront witnesses and to produce witnesses in their
 defense. An exception is allowed in cases in which distance or expense is deemed
 excessive for transporting witnesses to court. In such cases, sworn affidavits may
 be introduced. However, the Criminal Procedures Code does not provide for wit-
 nesses' immunity or for compulsory process of defense witnesses. As a result, wit-
 nesses are sometimes too afraid of retribution to testify against the authorities.
 In cases tried under the 1963 Antisubversion Law, trials in absentia are    -
 mitted and public access generally requires advance approval by the military. e
 courts commonly allow forced confessions and limit the presentation of defense evi-
 dence. For example, the court trying the suspects in the VMarsinah murder admitted
 their confessions into evidence and convicted them of the murder, even though the
 defendants claimed that their confessions had been obtained by coercion and tor-
 ture. The court allowed defense attorneys for the student mentioned above whose
 sentence was raised to 5 years on appeal, to call only one out of 17 witnesses they
 wished to present. Mochtar Pakpahan was not allowed to call expert legal witnesses
 in his defense (see Section 6). Defendants do not have the right to remain silent
 and can be compelled to testify in their own trials.
 The Criminal Procedures Code gives defendants the right to an attorney from the
 moment of their arrest through the investigation and trial. The law requires that
 a lawyer must be appointed in capital cases and those involving a prison sentence
 of 15 years or more. In cases involving potential sentences of 5 years or more, a
 lawyer must be appointed if the defendnt desires an attorney and is indigent. In
 theory destitute defendants may obtain private legal help, such as that provided by
 the Legal Aid Institute. In practice, however, defendants are often persuaded not
 to hire an attorney, or access to an attorney of their choice is impeded. The authori-
 ties reportedly pressured several defendants tried in Medan on charges stemming
 from labor unrest in April, which turned into anti-Chinese riots, to decline attor-
 neys, while some attorneys involved in the cases were subjected to official harass-
 ment of various kinds. Five East Timorese sentenced to 20 months imprisonment
 for publicly expressing anti-Indonesian sentiments during a banner-waving incident
 in the presence of foreign journalists were not represented by counsel. Authorities
 claim they declined the right to counsel, while nongovernmental sources indicated
 access to counsel was impeded, and that the defense lawyers were not notified in
 advance of their appearance in court that sentencing was to begin.
 The Supreme Court theoretically stands coequal with the executive and legislative
 branches, but it does not have the right of judicial review over laws passed by Par-
 liament. The Supreme Court has not yet exercised its power (held since 1985) to
 review  ministerial decrees and regulations. In   1993 Chief Justice Purwoto
 Gandasubrata laid out judicial procedures for limited judicial review, and some
 cases of this kind were initiated in 1994. Judges are civil servants employed by the
 executive branch, which controls their assignments, pay, and promotion. They are
 subject to considerable pressure from military and other governmental authorities.
 Such control often determines the outcome of a case. Corruption permeates the legal
 system. In civil and criminal cases, the payment of bribes can influence prosecution
 conviction, and sentencing. To address this problem, the Government announced
 that the salaries of judges would be doubled as of January 1, 1995.
 The Supreme Court bowed to government pressure in a longstanding land dispute
 between the central Java government and 34 farmers who had been forced to sell
 their land for the construction of the Kedungombo dam, a development project fund-
 ed by the World Bank. The villagers sued for increased compensation. The Supreme
 Court initially overturned decisions of both the Semarang district court and the
 
 
 596
 central Java high court in favor of the Government, awarding the plaintiffs even
 greater compensation than they had sought, including "nonmaterial losses." How-
 ever, the Supreme Court later reversed its own ruling after the Government refused
 to accept it and asked the Court to review it again.
 In an unusual move in November, the East Java High Court overturned the con-
 viction of the reputed mastermind of the Marsinah murder for insufficient evidence.
 The Government has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court despite provisions
 of the Criminal Code which disallow an appeal in such circumstances.
 For the fourth onsecutive year, there was a decline in the number of persons
 prosecuted under the 1963 Antisubversion Law, which carries a maximum penalty
 of death. The authorities tried at least five persons in 1994 under the Law for sub-
 version in Aceh and sentenced them to from 19 to 20 years' imprisonment. The
 Antisubversion Law makes it a crime to engage in acts that could distort, under-
 mine, or deviate from the state ideology or broad outlines of state policy, or which
 could disseminate feelings of hostility or arouse hostility, disturbances or anxiety
 among the population. The excessively vague language makes it possible to pros-
 ecute people merely for peaceful expression of views contrary to those of the Govern-
 ment.
 The Government does not make available statistics on the number of people cur-
 rently serving subversion sentences or sentences classified as felonies under the so-
 called Hate-Sowing or Sedition laws. Informed sources estimate the number of peo-
 ple serving sentences for subversion in 1994, including members of the banned Com-
 munist Party of Indonesia (PKI), Muslim militants, and those convicted of subver-
 sion in Irian Jaya, Aceh, and East Timor, at around 300. Scores, and possibly hun-
 dreds, more were believed to be serving sentences under the Hate-Sowing or Sedi-
 tion laws. Some of these persons advocated or employed violence, but many are po-
 litical prisoners who were convicted for attempting to exercise such universally rec-
 ognized human rights as freedom of speech or association or who were convicted in
 manifestly unfair trials. Six prisoners convicted of subversion remained under death
 sentence. Five of these were associated with the Indonesian Communist party are
 78 or more years old, and have been imprisoned for 29 years. In June two students
 convicted of subversion in 1993 for possessing banned literature and participating
 in illegal discussion -cups were granted conditional release after serving two-thirds
 of their sentences. Three alleged members of Aceh Merdeka convicted of subversion
 were released after serving lengthy sentences.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Judicial
 warrants for searches are required except for cases involving suspected subversion,
 economic crimes, and corruption. However security agencies regularly make forced
 or surreptitious entries. They also intimidate by surveillance of persons and resi-
 dences and selective monitoring of local and international telephone calls without
 legal restraint. Government security officials monitor the movements and activities
 of-former members of the PKI and its front organizations, especially persons the
 Government believes were involved in the abortive 1965 Communist-backed coup.
 The Government stated in late 1990 that this latter groupthen totaled 1,410,333
 people. These persons and their relatives sometimes are subject to surveillance, re-
 quired check-ins, periodic indoctrination, and restrictions on travel outside their city
 of residence. Their legally required identification cards carry the initials "E.T."
 which stand for 'Ex- apl," or former political prisoner, which readily identifies
 them to prospective employers or government officials.
 The Government's transmigration program which moved large numbers of people
 from overpopulated islands to more isolated and backward ones has been criticized
 by nongovernmental human rights monitors. They say that it not only violates the
 rights of indigenous people but also those of the transmigrants,claiming that they
 are frequently duped into leaving their home villages without any means of return
 (see Section 5.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The trend toward greater openness and freedom
 of expression in the press, which began in 1993 and continued through the first half
 of 1994, suffered a serious setback on June 21 when the Government revoked the
 pubishg permits of three of Indonesia's best known weekly publications: Temp,
 intik, andEditor. Tempo was the nation's most influential newsmagazine, founded
 in 1971 and widely respected for the breadth and depth of its coverage. Detik was
 a hard-hitting tabloid specializing in political affairs and social issues. Editor was
 a respected voice on public affairs. The official reasons given for revocation of the
 licenses were that Tempo had endangered national security through its reporting,
 and that the other two had committed administrative violations. It is widely be-
 lieved, however, that reporting of alleged differences in the Cabinet over a con-
 
 
 597
 troversial military procurement issue was the proximate cause of the Government's
 action.
 Although the Constitution and the 1982 Press Law provide for freedom of the
 press, the issuance of publishing licenses under a 1984 ministerial decree is one
 method the Government uses to control the press. Three other publications had
 their licenses revoked in the last decade, although two later reappeared with new
 names and changes in top management. In December Minister of Information
 Harmoko stated that the Government would issue no new press licenses during
 1995 for publications on current affairs, and he said there was no chance that the
 majority group of journalists from the former Tempo magazine would be issued a
 press permit to found a successor publication; rather, the Minister noted that a
 press permit had already been issued to a smaller gup of former Tempo employ-
 ees. Other means of control include regullation of the amount of advertising per-
 mitted and of the number of pages allowed in newspapers. The practice of telephon-
 ing editors to caution against-uvisbing certain stories--the s-called telephone cul-
 ture--ontinued, and its inci ~ene seemed to inrease following the action against
 the thre pubications in June. Self-.ensorship ontinued to be another publicly ac-
 knowledged brake on free expression whose effectiveness increased after June.
 Military and civilian authorities continued in some cases to issue instructions,
 more or less subtle, to local journalists on what they could print. For example, after
 extensive coverage of the April strikes and riots, press coverage of labor issues
 dropped markedly in Medan following directives from authorities to cut back on con-
 troversial issues. In Jakarta papers were warned against covering topics ranging
 from the prolonged summer dArought to the ban of the three publications. Medan po-
 lice tried to curb foreign coverage of the April disturbances by insisting on special
 rmits from the ministry of information, and at least two foreign reporters were
 orced to leave the city. The staff of East Timor's only newspaper were subject to
 various forms of intimidation by unknown sources, an  a newspaper-owned vehicle
 was burned and heavily damaged following the newspaper's coverage of a mid-July
 demonstration which was at variance with the official account.
 The Government's actions against press freedom in 1994 limited the increasingly
 vocal and independent press that has emerged in recent years. Although protest
 demonstrations dwindled following the harsh government reaction against some
 demonstrators, active opposition to the new government press measures continued
 in other channels. A number of unsanctioned journals continued to provide critical
 coverage of controversial issues, but they were circulated in small numbers largely
 in major cities. In August, 55 journalists founded the Alliance of Independent Jour-
 nalists, rivaling the gverment-sponsored Indonesian Journalists Association
 (PWI), to work for freeclom of expression and oppose any form of censorship and in-
 terferene in press freedom. In September the former chief editor of Tempo brought
 a lawsuit in Jakata adistrative ourt against the Minister of Information over
 the revocation of Tempo's license, the first ever such lawsuit. At year's end, this suit
 was still not decided.In October most of the edtrial staff of Detikjoined the staff
 of the existing publication Symphony and revamped it to resemble Detik. However,
 publication was suspended after only a few days when the PWI withdrew its legally
 required approval, thus jeopardizing Symphony's own publication license.
 While public dialog is still fr than it was a few years ago, the Government con-
 tinues to impose restrictions on free speech. For example, on August 29 security
 forces prohibited noted human rights activist Adnan Buyung Nasution from ad-
 dressing a seminar on development in Indonesian society in Surabaya. The Govern-
 ment also prevented several other public figures, including members of the National
 Human Rights Commission, from participating in public seminars on one or more
 occasions. Authorities often capriciously applied these strictures without clear jus-
 tification for the prohibition. In East Timor authorities denied permission for NGO's
 and the local university to hold an open seminar on development and the local envi-
 ronment. In February authorities in East Java banned the performance in Surabaya
 of a play by well-known author Emha Ainun Nadjib, which was critical of govern-
 ment land policies in development cases. Subsequently the authorities allowed per-
 formance of the play, which had been previously performed in JogJakarta. Two U.S.
 movies were banned following protest by Islamic religious leaders. However, a play
 about the controversial murder of labor activist Marsinah was staged in Jakarta in
 September.
 The electronic media remained more cautious in their coverage of the Government
 than the printed media. The Government operates the nationwide television net-
 work, which has 12 regional stations. Private television companies continued to ex-
 pand, with a fifth station scheduled to begin operation in November. All are re-
 quired to broadcast government-produced news, but many also produce public af-
 airs style programming that borders on news.
 
 
 598
 Approximately 600 private radio broadcasting companies exist in addition to the
 Government's nationa radio network. The government radio station produces "Na-
 tional News," which is by law the only radio news broadcast in Indonesia, and it
 is relayed throughout the country by the private stations and 49 regional affiliates
 of the government station. By law, the private radio stations may produce only
 "light" news, such as human interest stores, and may not discuss politics. In prac-
 tice, many broadcast interviews and foreign news as well.
 Foreign television and radio broadcasts are readily accessible to those who can af-
 ford the technology, and satellite dishes have proliferated throughout the country.
 The Government makes no efforts to restrict access to this programming.
 The Government closely regulates access to Indnesia, particularly to certain
 areas of the county, by visiting and resident foreign correspondents, and occasion-
 ally reminds the latter of its prerogative to deny requests or visa extensions. The
 Government requires a permi or     e importation offoreign publications and video
 tapes, which must be reviewed by government censors. Importers sometimes avoid
 foreign materials critical of the Government or dealing with topics considered sen-
 sitive, such as human rights. Foreign publications are normally available, although
 several issues were delayed or embargoed in 1994 when they carried stories on mat-
 ters considered sensitive, such as East Timor.
 Special permission is necessary for foreign journalists to travel to East Timor, and
 the Government organized a number of group trips to the province during the year.
 Approval for individual trips by journalists to theprovince, and for travel outside
 Dill, remains difficult. During the November APE meetings, the Government ap-
 proved travel to the province-by several dozen foreign journalists, the largest num-
 ber to visit the province in many years. Some six journalists and freelancers who
 had not obtained permits were denied access to the province or instructed by au-
 thorities to leave East Timor.
 While the law provides for academic freedom, constraints exist on the activities
 of scholars. Political activity and discussions at universities, while no longer for-
 mally banned, remained tightly controlled. Scholars sometimes refrain from produc-
 ing or including in lectures and class discussions materials that they believe might
 provoke government displeasure. An Indonesian academic who has conducted stud-
 ies on East Timor and whose conclusions are at variance with those of the Govern-
 ment was strongly criticized by government figures and his house stoned by un-
 known youths. Publishers sometimes refuse to accept manuscripts dealing with con-
 troversial issues. On occasion the Government bans publications and books outright.
 In January it banned a book dealing with President Soeharto's rise to power, and
 in August, the Attorney General banned a book published by the leader of the mes-
 sianic Islamic sect Darul Arqam, the third book of this group to be banned in Indo-
 nesia. On the other hand, "The Fugitive," a book by the prominent Indonesian nov-
 elist and former politicalprisoner Pramoedya Anata Toer, which together with other
 works by Pramoedya had been banned for many years was published in August.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although the Constitution pro-
 vides for freedom of assembly and association, the Government places significant
 controls on the exercise of this right. All organizations must have government per-
 mission to hold regional and national meetings. Public marches and demonstrations
 also require permits, which are frequently not granted. During the year, government
 and military authorities returned to a more restrictive policy on authorizing public
 protest demonstrations, after loosening such restrictions for a while during the lat-
 ter half of 1993. Many jurisdictions often require prior approval for smaller gather-
 ings as well. While obtaining such approval is usually routine, the authorities occa-
 sionally withhold permission or break up peaceful gatherings for which no permit
 has been obtained. In 1994 authorities broke up a meeting between an attorney and
 his clients in a labor compensation case, and a public seminar on land issues which
 was sponsored by a well-known NGO.
 The courts sometimes hand out stiff penalties to persons convicted in cases involv-
 ing free expression, as in the two cases of student demonstrators (mentioned in Sec-
 tion n.e. aove), whos sentences were increased on appeal, while at other times
 they are more lenient. On June 27, security forces violently broke up two peaceful
 marches on the Ministry of Information by persons prtesting the withdrawal of
 publication licenses from the three publications mentioned above. Approximately 30
 persons were detained by the authorities and several demostraters were injured.
 The Jakarta central district court sentenced all but one of the persons arrested on
 the day after their arrest for demonstrating without a permit, and they were re-
 leased after paying a nominal fine equivalent to $1. The remaining person, a pa-
 rlee, was returned to prison to finish his sentence. On July 7, police entered the
 compound of the Legal Aid Society, a prominent Indonesian human rights NGO, and
 arrested 41 hunger strikers who were protesting the media banning. These dem-
 
 
 599
 onstrators, too, were sentenced to pay token fines and released after 2 days. Other
 demonstrations on this issue during this period were allowed to take place without
 incident, such as a July 5 demonstration of journalists in Jakarta.
 A group of several hundred people, who had assembled at the University of East
 Timor wishing to march to the provincial assembly to air their views about an inci-
 dent of alleged religious disrespect the previous day, were dispersed by riot police
 who refused to let the march proceed without a permit. Around a dozen individuals
 were lightly injured in this incident, and a number were briefly detained. The au-
 thorities showed greater restraint than in past incidents involving crowds, using po-
 lice rather than the army and avoiding the use of firearms.
 The 1985 Social Organizations Law (ORMAS) requires the adherence of all orga-
 nizations, including recognized religions and associations, to the official ideology of
 Pancasila. This provision, which limits political activity, is widely understood as de-
 signed to inhibit activities of groups seeking to make Indonesia an Islamic state.
 The law empowers the Government to disband any organization it believes to be act-
 ing against Pancasila and requires prior government approval for any organization's
 acceptance of funds from foreign donors, thereby hindering the work of many local
 humanitarian organizations. Nevertheless, a significant number of organizations, in-
 cluding the independent labor organization Serikat Buruh Sejahtera Indonesia
 (SBSI), continue to be active without official recognition under this law (see Section
 6).
 In the past few years, NGO's have proliferated in such fields as human rights,
 the environment, development, and consumer protection. In late 1994, the Govern-
 ment prepared a draft presidential decree that would bring the more than 700
 NGO's under controls similar to the ORMAS Law. The draft decree made available
 by the Government for comment indicated that NGO's would have to receive govern-
 ment approval for the use of any foreign assistance they accept, and such assistance
 must be deemed consistent with national development policy and not detrimental
 to national interests. NGO's would also be prohibited from engaging in political ac-
 tivity and would receive government guidance on fulfilling their decared functions.
 Many NGO's, fearing that the proposed new decree is an effort by the Government
 to control their organizations or curb some of their activities, reacted strongly to the
 draft which, at year's end, the Government had not yet put into effect.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for religious freedom and belief
 in one Supreme God. The Government recognizes Islam, Christianity, Buddhism,
 and Hinduiism, and permits practice of the mystical, traditional beliefs of "Aliran
 Kepercayaan." Although the population is overwhelmingly Muslim, the practice and
 teachings of the other recognized religions are generally respected, and the Govern-
 ment actively promotes mutual tolerance and harmony among them. Some restric-
 tions on certain types of religious activity exist (see below).
 Because the first tenet of Pancasila is belief in a supreme being, atheism is forbid-
 den. The legal requirement to adhereto Pancasila extends to all religious and secu-
 lar organizations. The Government strongly opposes Muslim groups which advocate
 establishing an Islamic state or acknowledging only Islamic law. There are govern-
 ment procedures for banning religious sects in Indonesia. Among those prohibited
 are Jehovah's Witnesses andBaha'i. In 1994 the Government banned the messianic
 Islamic sect Darul Arqam in a number of provinces, prohibited three of its books,
 and in August forbade its leader, Abuya Sheikh Imam Ashaari Muhammad, from
 entering Indonesia.
 Violence between rival factions in the Huria Kristen Batak Protestan (HKBP), In-
 donesia's largest Protestant church, continued in north Sumatra throughout 1994,
 with at least six fatalities. In early 1993, citing a threat to civil order, the Northern
 Sumatra regional military commander intervened in an internal leadership dispute
 which broke out within the HKBP the previous year, appointing a new bishop and
 helping the new bishop's supporters take over church property. Civilian and military
 authorities have called the dispute an internal church matter that should be re-
 solved by the HKBP members themselves. To date, however, only supporters of the
 former bishop have been prosecuted for acts of violence despite evidence that mem-
 bers of the opposing faction engaged in violent acts as well.
 There were widespread reports from religious minorities indicating that the ex-
 tent of religious tolerance weakened somewhat during the year and that they felt
 less free to carry out their religious activities unimpeded. High-level officials, includ-
 ing the President, however, spoke out several times to emphasize the importance
 of religious tolerance. Two army privates accused of provocative behavior during a
 Catholic mass in East Timor in June were court-martialed. In October both were
 expelled from the army, and received prison sentences of 2, and 2Y2 years respec-
 tively. The law allows conversion between faiths, and such conversions occur. Mar-
 riages between persons of different religions are allowed. The Government views
 
 
 600
 prselytizing by the rcgnized religions in areas heavily dominated by one recog-
 d religion or another as potentially disruptive and discourages it. Foreign mis-
 sionary activities are relatively u      although in East Timor and occasionally
 elsewhere missionaries have experienced difficulties and delays in renewing resi-
 dence permits, and visas allowing the entrance of new foreign clergy are difficult
 to obtain. Laws and decrees from the 1970's limit the number of years foreign mis-
 sionaries can spend in Indonesia, with some extensions granted in remote areas like
 Irian Jaya. Foreign missionary work is subject to the funding stipulations of the
 ORMAS Law (see Section 2.b.). Indonesians practicing the recognized religions
 maintain active links with coreligionists inside and outside Indonesia and travel
 abroad for religious gatherings.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-In 1993 the Government drastically reduced the number of people
 barred either from entering or departing Indonesia from a publicly announced figure
 of 8,897 'blacklisted" people in January to a few hundred by August. According to
 government authorities, no one is now prohibited for political reasons from leaving
 the country. However, the Government restricts movement by Indonesian and for-
 eign citizens to and within parts of Indonesia. In addition, it requires permits to
 seek work in a new location in certain areas, primarily to control further population
 movement to crowded cities, and special permits are required to visit certain parts
 of Irian Jaya. The military carried out security checks affecting transportation and
 travel to and within East Timor sporadically in 1994, and it occasional imposed cur-
 fews in connection with military operations. The authorities require former political
 detainees, including those associated with the abortive 1965 coup, to give notice of
 their movements and to have official permission (see Section 1.f.) to change their
 place of residence.
 In past years the Government admitted large numbers of asylum seekers from
 Indochina. Only a relatively small number now remain and the Government plans
 to work with Vietnam under a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding signed in
 1993 with the United Nations Hig commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to peace-
 fully repatriate the remaining asylees to Vietnam.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the abiitr to change their government through democratic
 means. The 1,000-member People s Consultative Assembly (MPR), which is constitu-
 tionally the highest authority of the State and meets every 5 years to elect the
 President and Vice President and set the broad outlines of state polcy, is controlled
 by the Government through the appointment of half its membership. The remaining
 half come from the National Parliaent (DPR), 80 percent of whose members are
 elected. In 1993 the MPR elected Soeharto to his sixth uncontested 5-year term as
 President. Legally, the President is constitutionally subordinate to the Parliament
 but actually he and a small group of active duty and retired military officers and
 civilian officials exercise governmental authority.
 Under a doctrine known as "dual function," the military assumes a significant so-
 ciopolitical as well as a security role. Members of the military are allotted an
 unelected 20 percent of the seats in national, provincial, and district parliaments,
 and occupy numerous key positions in the administration. The other 80 percent of
 national and local parliamentary seats are filled through elections held every 5
 years. All adult citizens are eligible to vote, except active duty members of the
 armed forces, convicted criminals serving prison sentences and some 36,000 former
 PKI members. Voters choose by secret ballot between the three government-ap-
 proved political organizations, which field candidate lists in each electoral district.
 Those lists must be screened by BAKORSTANAS (see Section l.d.), which deter-
 mines whether candidates were involved in the abortive 1965 Communist coup or
 pose other broadly defined security risks. Critics charge these screenings are uncon-
 stitutional, since there is no way to appeal the results, and note that they can be
 used to eliminate critics of the Government from Parliament.
 Strict rules establish the length of political campaigns, access to electronic media,
 schedules for public appearances, and the political symbols that can be used. The
 Government permits only three political organizations to exist and contest elections.
 The largest and most important of these is GOLKAR, a government-sponsored orga-
 nization of diverse functional groups which won 68 percent of the seats in the 1992
 elections. The President strongly influences the selection of the leaders of GOLKAR.
 The other two small political organizations, the Unity Development Party (PPP) and
 the Democratic Party of Indonesia (PDI), split the remaining vote. The law requires
 all three political organizations to embrace Pancasila, and none of the organizations
 is considered an opposition party. Government authorities closely scrutinize and
 
 
 601
 often guide their activities. Members of the DPR and the provincial assemblies may
 be recalled from office by party leaders.
 GOLKAR maintains close institutional links with the armed forces and KORPRI,
 the association to which all civil servants automatically belong. Civil servants may
 join any of the political parties with official permission, but most are members of
 GOLKAR. Former members of the PKI and some other banned parties may not run
 for office or be active politically. The DPR considers bills presented to it by govern-
 ment departments and agencies but does not draft laws on its own, although it has
 the constitutional right to do so. The DPR makes technical and occasionally sub-
 stantive alterations to bills it reviews. In practice, it remains clearly subordinate to
 the executive branch, but recently it has  eme much more active in scrutinizing
 government policy through hearings at which members of the Cabinet, military com-
 manders, and other high officials are asked to testify. For example, parliamentary
 examination brought to light a major scandal in government banks and forced the
 Government to addess it seriously. The DPR has also become increasingly a focal
 point of appeals and petitions from students, workers, displaced farmers, and others
 protesting alleged human rights abuses and airing other grievances.
 While there are no de jure restrictions on women in politics, only 55 out of 500
 members of the national Parliament are women; 2 women are cabinet members.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While various domestic organizations and persons interested in human rights op-
 erate energetically, some human rights monitors face government harassment such
 as frequent visits by police or agents from military intelligence, interrogations at po-
 lice stations, or cancellations of private meetings (see Section 2.b.). Following the
 April labor unrest in Medan, local security authorities increased surveillance and
 harassment of NGO's in north Sumatra that were active in labor affairs. Moreover,
 the Government prepared in 1994 a draft decree which, if issued and fully imple-
 mented, would give it broad powers to control the activities of NGO's concerned with
 human rights and seriously impede their ability to function.
 The Government considers outside investigations of alleged human rights viola-
 tions to be interference in its internal affairs and emphasizes its belief that linking
 foreign assistance to human rights observance is unacceptable. In 1994it pressured
 several neighboring countries to prohibit or restrict N-spnsored human rights
 seminars on the situation in East  ior.
 The ICRC continued to operate in East Timor, Irian Jaya, and Aceh, and to visit
 prisoners convicted of participation in the abortive, Communist-backed coup in 1965,
 convicted Muslim extremists, and East Timores prisoners. However, as of year's
 end, the Government had not approved the ICRC's request to open an office in Aceh,
 though official cooperation on access by its delegates from Jakarta showed substan-
 tial improvement in 1994.
 ICRC access also greatly improved in other areas, including East Timor where it
 has an office. The ICR no longer maintains an office in Irian Jaya but visits that
 province from Jakarta several times a year. However, in 1994 the visiting represent-
 ative of Human Rights Watch/Asia, a ke U.S. human rights NGO, was denied per-
 mission to visit Medan and East Timor.  e Government authorized the visit octhe
 U.N. Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary and Arbitrary Executions and
 allowed him to see those persons he had requested. The Rapporteur publicly ques-
 tioned, however, whether all those who might have wanted to speak with him had
 been afforded full access.
 In January the National Human Rights Commission, most of whose members
 were named the month before, began operations. Despite continuing skepticism
 about the Commission's independence, in part because its members are appointed
 by the Preisit Mmision members dur     g the course of theyear activelyt looked
 into many of the numerous complaints and petitions presentedto it and in some
 cases showed themselves willing to question government actions. For example, the
 Commission strongly condemned the Government's revocation of the publication li-
 ceases of three publications (Section 2.a.) as an infringement of free speech, and it
 has criticized the way in which the suspects in the Marsinah murder case were
 prosecuted, as well as questioning whether all the guilty had been brought to jus-
 tice. Lacking enforcement powers, the Commission attempts to work within the sys-
 tem, sending teams where necessary to inquire into possible human rights problems
 and employing persuasion, publicity, and moral authority to highlight ahuses and
 encourage corrective action. A team visited East Timor in September and December.
 Operations in 1994 were hampered somewhat by startup logistical and procedural
 problems.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-By law, women are equal to and have the same rights, obligations, and
 opportunities as men. However, in practice women face some legal discrimination.
 For example, in divorce cases women often bear a heavier evidentiary burden than
 men, especiall in the Islamic-based family court system. Although some women
 enjoy ahigh degree of economic and social freedom and occupy important midlevel
 poitions in beth the public and private sectors, the majority of women do not expe-
 rience such social and economic freedoms, and are often disproportionately rep-
 resented at the lower end of the position scale. For example, athough women con-
 stitute one-quarter of the civil service, they occupy only a small fraction of the serv-
 ice's top posts. Income disparity between men and women diminishes significantly
 with greater educational attainment.
 Women are often not given the extra benefits and salary that men receive that
 is their due when they are the head of household, and in some cases do not receive
 employment benefits for their husband and children, such as medical insurance. De-
 spite laws guaranteeing women a 3-month maternity leave, the Government has
 conceded that pregnant women are often dismissed or are replaced while on leave.
 Some companies require that women sign statements that they will not become
 pregnant. Women workers also have complained of being sexually victimized by
 foremen and factory owners.
 Women workers in manufacturing generally receive lower wages than men and
 also are more likely to be hired on a daily only basis. As a result, they are less likely
 to receive benefits legally mandated for permanent workers.
 Women disproportionately experience illiteracy, poor health, and inadequate nu-
 trition. However, women's educational indicators have improved in the last decade.
 For example, the number of girls graduating from high school tripled from 1980 to
 1990. Several voluntary, private groups work actively to advance women's legal, eco-
 nomic, social, and political rights and claim some success in gaining official cog-
 nizance of women's concerns.
 Rape is a punishable offense in Indonesia. Men have been arrested and sentenced
 for rape and attempted rape. The National Police reported 1,341 rape cases for
 1991, 1,356 cases for 1992, and 1,341 cases for 1993. However, women's rights activ-
 ists believe rape is grossly underreprted owing to the social stigma attached to the
 victim. Some legal experts state that if a woman does not go immediately to the
 hospital for a physical exam which produces semen or other physical evidence of
 rape, she will not be able to bring charges. Some women fail to report rape to police
 out of fear of being molested again by the police themselves."
 In general, the problem of violence against women remains poorly documented.
 However, the Government has acknowle     the problem of domestic violence in so-
 iety, which some say has been aggavated by reent social changes brought about
 by rapid urbanization. [ongstan;ing traditional beliefs that te husband may
 "teach  or "ontrl" the wife tugh several means, including violence, also contrib-
 ute to the problem. Although women's groups are tr g tcange the law, rape by
 a husband of a wife is not a crime in Indonesia. While police could bring assault
 charges agst a husband for beating his wife, due to social attitudes they are un-
 likely to do so. The Government provides some counseling, and several private orga-
 nizations exist to assist women. Many of these organizations focus mainly on reuit-
 ing the family rather than on providing protection to the women involved There are
 no battered women's shelters. Many women rely on extended family systems for as-
 sistance in cases of domestic violence.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and welfare, but is
 hampered by a lack of resources in translating this commitment into practice. A
 1979 law on children's welfare defines the responsibility of the State and parents
 to nurture and protect children. However, implementing regulations have never
 been developed, and the law's provisions have yet to go into effect. The Government
 has made particular efforts to improve primary education, maternity services, and
 family planning.
 The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) estimates that more than 1 mil-
 lion children drop out of primary school every year due mainly to the cost of sup-
 plies, uniforms and other expenses, in addition to the professed need for the chil-
 dren to supplement family income. Thousands of street children living in Jakarta
 and other cities sell newspapers, shine shoes, help to park or watch cars, and other-
 wise earn money. Many thousands more work in factories and fields (see also Sec-
 tion 6.d.). NGO's criticize government efforts to help these children as inadequate.
 Child prostitution and other sexual abuses occur, especially cases of incest be-
 tween stepfathers and stepdaughters, but data on their incidence is lacking. Some
 child care experts believe it to be low. While there are laws designed to protect chil-
 
 
 603
 dren from indecent activities, prostitution, and incest, the Government has made no
 special enforcement efforts in these areas.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM) occurs in some parts of Indonesia; precise statis-
 tics are not available. In Java, it usually takes place within the first year after birth
 and is performed either at a hospital or by a local traditional practitioner or
 "dukun,  especially in rural areas. Usually a small section of the tip of the clitoris
 is cut or a small incision is made in the tip of the clitoris with the purpose of draw-
 ing a few drops of blood Total removal of the clitoris is not the objective of the prac-
 tice, although it does occur if ineptly performed.
 Indigenous People.-The Government states publicly that it recognizes the exist-
 ence of several indigenous population groups, and that they have a right to partici-
 pate fully in plitics] and social life. Critics maintain that the Government's a
 proach is basilly paternalistic and desed more to integrate them more closely
 into Indonesian society than to protect their traditional way of life.
 The Government's transmigration program   which move large numbers of people
 from overpopulated islands to more isolated and backward ones, has been s    tgfi-
 cantly reduced in recent years. The program is criticized by human rights monitors
 who say that it not only sometimes violates the rights of indigenous people but also
 those of some of the transmigrants who claim ta   they are duped into leaving their
 home villages without any means of return.
 Human rights monitors have expressed concern about the practices of some lg-
 gigcompanies which recruit indigenous people for work. According to Human
 hts Watch, this activity in Irian  aya has separated these people from their tra-
 ditional economies. Workers reportedly are paidnsing company-issued credit cards
 that can be used only at company stores where prices are fxed. Workers go into
 debt and remain indentured to the company.
 Where indigenous people clash with development prjects, the developers almost
 always win. For example,  i   Kaimantan meers of a Dayak tribe were forced
 from their land by a timber concession in August. In retaliation, they attacked com-
 pany facilities and several were subsequently arrested.
 Most civil servants in local governments in Irian Jaya and other isolated areas
 continue to come primarily from Java rather tha the indigaenous population.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.Inndonesians exhibit consierable racial and
 ethnic tolerance, with the important exception of official and informal discrimination
 against ethnic Chinese, who comprise about 3 percent of the population. Since 1959
 noncitizen ethnic Chinese have been denied the ight to run businesses in rural In-
 donsia. Regulations prohibit the operation of all cinese schools for ethnic Chinese,
 formation of exclusively Chinese cultural grups or trade associations, and public
 display of Chinese characters. In August the ban on use of Chinese characters was
 eased slightly to allow ims working in the tourist industry to produce Chinese-lan-
 guage brochures, programs, and s      cmilar material for Chinese-speaking tourists.
 However, Chinese-language publications, with the exception of one government-
 owned daily newspaper, may neither be imported nor produced domestically. Private
 instruction in Chinese is generally prohibited but takes place to a limited extent,
 and since Augut has been allowed in training employees in the tourism industry
 in functinal Mandarin. State universities have no formal quotas that limit the
 number of ethnic Chinese. The law forbids the celebration of the Chinese New Year
 in temples or public places, but its enforcement was limited in 1994, and Chinese
 New Year decorations were displayed in public shopping areas in major cities.
 East Tiorese and various human rights groups charge that the East Timorese
 are under represented in the civil service in East Timor. It is difficult to confim
 or deny the charges as there appears to be no registry of the birth place of civil serv-
 ants, Who can be transferred anywhere. East Timorse have expressed concern that
 theetransmigration program could lead to fewer employment opportunities and
 might eventually destroy East Timr's cultural identity.
 People With Disab    wes.-rNo national law specifically addresses the problems or
 status of the disabled, nor do they receive special proams or attention. However,
 during 1994 the Ministry of SocialWelfare began  a in  regulations on treatment
 of the handicapped partly based on the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Presi-
 dent Soehartogave his approval to submission of these new regulations to the Par-
 liament. Virtually no public buildingsor public means of transport are designed spe-
 cifically for access by the disabled. They face considerable discrimination in employ-
 ment.
 The Constitution includes the right of every citizen to obtain an education. In
 1989 the Government issued regulations covering education for the mentally and
 physically disabled. However, these culations do not grant a right to public edu-
 cation for handicapped children. While there are some public schools for the handi-
 capped, the Government supports the concept that education should be provided by
 
 
 604
 the community in the form of NGO-run private schools that may receive some public
 funds.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Private sector workers including those in export
 processing zones are free to form worker organizations without prior authorization.
 Until 1994 only a recognized union could bargain on behalf of employees or rep-
 resent workers in the Department of Manpower's labor courts. A new regulation
 promulgated in January provides that workers in a single company with more than
 25 employees can join together and negotiate legally binding agreements with their
 employer outside the framework of the All Indonesian Workers Union (SPSI) the
 only legally recognized union (see below). The Government encourages these plant-
 level workers associations to join the SPSI. While 192 of these plant-level associa-
 tions were formed by the end of the year, only one had concluded a collective bar-
 gaining agreement with management. Current numerical requirements for union
 recognition, though lowered in 1993 still constitute a significant barrier to recogni-
 tion and the right to engage in collective bargaining. In addition, the Ministry of
 Manpower enforces a regulation that requires a union be set up -by and for work-
 ers" to deny recognition to groups which include people it considers nonworkers,
 such as lawyers or human rights activists, who are involved as labor organizers.
 There is, de facto, a single union sytem, and it is the Government's stated policy
 to seek to improve effectiveness of the recognized SPSI unions rather than to fur-
 ther the process for the formation of alternative organizations. The SPSI began in
 1993 a transformation from a unitary (centralized) to a federative (decentralized)
 structure. Its 13 industrial sectors are now registered as independent unions. The
 only unions recognized by the Department of Manpower are those which previously
 constituted the SPSrs industrial sectors.
 Two other labor groups, Setia Kawan (Solidarity), also known as Serikat Buruh
 Merdeka (SBM, Free Trade Union), and Serikat Buruh Sejahtera Indonesia (SBSI,
 Indonesian Workers Welfare Union), have been organized but are not registered.
 Setia Kawan, founded 3 years ago, is now essentially moribund. The SBSI, created
 in 1992, claims it has formed the necessary number of factory-level units to meet
 the legal requirements for registration as a labor union, but its most recent request
 in November for registration as a trade union was denied. The Minister of Man-
 power has stated that any unions which are formed should affiliate with the SPSI
 federation and that the Government will not recognize any unions outside the fed-
 eration. There have reportedly been tentative overtures to bring the SBSI into the
 SPSI. The SBSL however, has refused to accept these offers.
 The SBSI also has attempted unsuccessfully three times to register with the De-
 partment of Home Affairs as a social organization under the ORMAS Law, a pre-
 requisite to recognition as a labor union. The Home Affairs Department had not re-
 plied at year's end to SBSrs most recent request of November 17.
 The Government considers the SBSI illegal. Although the Government has not
 disbanded it, it has continually harassed it, especially after large-scale labor dem-
 onstrations, which the SBSI helped to organize in Medan in April, degenerated into
 anti-Chinese rioting. The Government arrested a number of the Medan SBSI leader-
 ship in the spring, and it arrested the National Chairman of the SBSI, Muchtar
 Pakpahan, in August. They were charged with inciting violence in connection with
 the riots. The Director General of the International Labor Organization (IL) sent
 a strongly worded letter to the Minister of Manpower expressing "serious concerns
 over the arrest of Pakpahan. The Medan leadership received sentences of between
 3 and 15 months in prison. In November Pakpahan was sentenced to a 3-year prison
 term, a sentence that was extended to 4 years in January 1995 when his appeal
 was rejected. It is widely believed  the Government's actions against the SBSI
 leadership are intended to discredit or destroy the organization(
 Also in November, the ILO's Committee on Freedom of Assciation, in its conclu-
 sions on the complaint made by the SBSI against the Government, criticized the
 Government's policy of recognizing only the SPSI and commented that "beyond the
 specific events raised in the present case, the Committee feels bound to note that
 the allegations reveal, from a more general perspective, a situation of a trade union
 monopoly in practice, and of heavy involvement of the police and armed forces in
 labor matters," and called on the Government to refrain from showing favoritism
 toward, or discrimination against, any particular unions.
 Because of past Ministry of Manpower regulations, many SPSI factory units are
 led by persons who have little credibility with their units' members because they
 were selected by employers. A new regulation states that employees must only no-
 tify their employer that they wish to form  a union and that they may proceed if
 they do not receive a response from their employer within 2 weeks. Despite this new
 
 
 provision, strikes continue to occur because employers attempt to prevent the forma-
 tion of union branches. These strikes are invariably successful, and the formation
 of an SPSI unit follows shortly thereafter. However, workers who are active in the
 formation of the union are frequently dismissed and have no practical protection by
 either law or government practice.
 Civil servants are not permitted to join unions and must belong to KORPRL, a
 nonunion association whose Central Development Council is chared-by the Minister
 of Home Affairs. State enterprise employees, defined to include those working in en-
 terprises in which the State has a 5-percent holding or greater, usually are required
 to join KORPRI, but a small number of state enterprises have SPSI units. Teachers
 must belong to the Teachers' Association (PGRI). While technically classed as a
 union, the PGRI continues to function more as a welfare organization and does not
 appear to have engaged in trade union activities such as collective bargaining.
 Unions may draw up their own constitutions and rules and elect their representa-
 tives. However, the Government has a great deal of influence over the SPSI and its
 federated unions. The head of the SPSI is a senior member of GOLKAR, and he and
 two other senior SPSI officials are members of Parliament representing GOLKAR.
 With one exception, all members of the executive council are members of GOLKAR.
 These persons have been given positions in the new federated industrial sector
 unions. The Minister of Manpower is a member of the SPSrs Consultative Council.
 Numerous regional SPSI officials also are GOLKAR members, sometimes serving in
 regional legislatures. According to credible reports, the Government interferes in the
 selection of SPSI officers, especially by placing retired military officers in midlevel
 SPSI positions. The Government has stated that it will cease  e ractice of placing
 military officers in union positions and eventually will remove officials with signifi-
 cant GOLKAR connections.
 Under the Criminal Code, police approval is needed for all meetings of five people
 or more of all organizations outside ofices or normal work sites. This prvision also
 applies to union meetings. Permission is routinely given to the SPSI but not to rival
 organizations such as SBSI, which was prevented from holding several meetings
 over the last few years, including its first congress in 1993. The Government may
 dissolve a union if it believes the union is acting against Pancasila, although it has
 never actually done so, and there are no laws or regulations specifying procedures
 for union dissolution.
 The SPSI maintains international contacts but is not affiliated with any inter-
 national trade union organizations except the association of Southeast Asian nations
 (ASEAN) Trade Union Council.
 On April 20 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions lodged a formal
 complaint against Indonesia with the International Labor Organization (ILO),
 supplementing a previous complaint filed in 1987, accusing the Government of deny-
 ing workers' right to set up unions of their own choosing, harassing independent
 workers' organizations, and of taking other actions contrary to ]ILO standards on
 freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining.
 While Pancasila principles ca for labor-management differences to be settled by
 consensus, all organized workers except civil servants have the legal right to strike.
 While state enterprise emp    sand teachers rarely exercise this right, private sec-
 tor strikes are freuent. eore a strike can occur in the private sector, the law re-
 quires intensive mediation by the Department of Manpower and prior notice of the
 intent to strike. However, no a proval is required. In practice, dispute settlement
 procedures are not followed, an formal notice of the intent to strike is rarely given
 because Department of Manpower procedures are slow. These procedures have little
 credibility with workers, who ignore them. Sudden strikes, therefore, tend to result
 from longstanding grievances or recognition that legally mandated benefits or rights
 are not being received. While strike leaders are not arrested for illegal strikes, they
 often lose their jobs and have no legal recourse for reinstatement. The number of
 strikes increased significantly during 1994 compared to the previous year, with the
 most dramatic increases occurring in the first quarter of the year.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 vided for by law, and the Department of Manpower promotes it within the context
 of the national ideology, Pancasila. Until recently only recognized trade unions, that
 is, the SPSI and its components, could legally engage in collective bargaining. As
 noted, new government regulations also permit unailiated plant-level workers as-
 sociations to conclude legally binding agreements with employers, though only one
 had done so by year's end. Agreements concluded by any other groups are not con-
 sidered legally binding and are not registered by the Department of Manpower.
 The majority of the collective bargaining agreements between the SPSI units and
 employers are negotiated bilaterally. Once notified that 25 employees have joined
 a registered SPSI or independent plant level union, an employer is obligated to bar-
 
 
 606
 ain with it. In companies without unions, the Government discourages workers
 m utilizing outside assistance, e.g., during consultations with employers over
 company regulations. Instead, the Department of Manpower prefers tat workers
 seek its assistance and believes that its role is to protect workers. There are credible
 reports that for some Indonesian companies, consultations are perfunctory at best
 and usually with management-selected workers; there are also credible reports to
 the contrary from U.S. companies. Over half of the factory-level SPSI units have col-
 lective bargaining agreements. The degree to which these agreements are freely ne-
 gotiatd between unions and management without government interference varies.
 By regulation, negotiations must be oncluded within 30 days or be submitted to the
 Department of Manpwer for mediation and conciliation or arbitration. Most nego-
 tiations are concluded within the 30-day period. Agreements are for 2 years and can
 be extended for 1 year. According to NGO's involved in labor issues, the provisions
 of these agreements rarely go beyond the legal minimum standards established by
 the Government, and the agreements are often merely presented to worker rep-
 resentatives for signing rather than being negotiated.
 Although government regulations prohibit employers from discriminating or
 harassing employees because of union membership, there are credible reports from
 union officials, of employer retribution against union organizers, including firing,
 which is not effectively prevented or remedied in practice. Some employers report-
 edly have warned their employees against contact with union organizers from the
 unrecognized SBSI organization. In addition to Marsinah (see Section .e.), several
 other labor union activists have died under mysterious circumstances duringthe
 past 2 years. Some human rights and labor NG(Ys believe that the authorities have
 not adequately investigated these deaths.
 Charges of antiunion discrimination are adjudicated by administrative tribunals.
 However, many union members believe the tribunals generally side with employers.
 Because of this perceived partiality, many workers reject or avoid the procedure and
 present their grievances directly to Parliament and other agencies. Administrative
 decisions in favor of dismissed workers tend to be monetary awards; workers are
 rarely reinstated. The provisions of the law make it difficult to fire workers, but the
 law is often ignored in practice.
 The armed forces, which include the police, continues to involve itself in labor is-
 sues, despite new regulations promulgated in January to prohibit military inter-
 ference when there is no threat to security. There is some evidence that the inci-
 dence of such military involvement decreased in 1994, and some observers credit
 government security forces with restraint in restoring order in the Medan riots of
 April However, these perceptions are not shared by all observers. Workers charge
 that members of the security forces attempt to intimidate union organizers and
 strike leaders and have been p resent in significant numbers during some strikes,
 even when there has been no destruction of pro rty or other violence. Members of
 military intelligence attended and monitored trade union education seminars run by
 the Asian-American Free Labor Institute (AAFLI), even though these programs
 were approved by the Department of Manpower. In 1993 the military command in
 Surabaya also halted an AAFLI-SPSI program on legal aid for industrial disputes
 approved by the Department of Manpower. At year's end the program had not been
 allowed to resume despite government assurances. Military officials occasionally
 have been reported present during negotiations between workers and management.
 Their presence has been described as intimidating by plant-level union officials. A
 military officer was among those convicted in connection with the Marsinah murder
 case.
 Labor law applies equally in export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law forbids forced labor, and
 the Government generally enforces it. NGO reports have alleged that some cases of
 forced labor in the form of debt bondage by login g companies exist in Irian Jaya.
 The Government says that it is unable to veriI these allegations because they are
 insufficiently specific. No complaints or information on forced labor in Irian Jaya
 had come to the attention of the National Human Rights Commission as of late Sep-
 tember. (See also Section 5, Indigenous People.)
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Child labor exists in both indus-
 trial areas and rural areas. There are an estimated 2.7 million working children be-
 tween the ages of 10 and 14, according to a 1994 report of the U.N. Human Rights
 Commission. Indonesia was one of the first countries to be selected for participation
 in the ILO's International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor (IPEC), and
 signed a memorandum of understanding with the ILO to guide their collaboration
 under this program on May 29, 1992. Recommendations for a plan of action were
 developed at a national conference in Bogor in July 1993. During 1994, 120 govern-
 
 
 607
 ment labor inspectors received ILO-sponsored training on child labor matters under
 the IPEC program.
 The Government acknowledges that there is a class of children who must work
 for socioeconomic reasons, and in 1987 the Minister of Manpower issued regulation
 per-ol/men/1987, 'Protection of Children Forced to Work," to regulate this situation.
 This regulation legalizes the employment of children under the age of 14 who must
 work to contribute to the income of their families. It requires parental consent, pro-
 hibits dangerous or diicult work, limits work to 4 hours daily, and requs em-
 ployers to report the number of children working under its prvisions. It does not
 set a minimum age for children in this category, effectively superseding the colonial-
 era government ordinance of December 17, 1925, on "Measures Limiting Child
 Labour and Nightwork of Women," which is still the current law governing child
 labor and sets a minimum age of 12 for employment. The 1987 regulation is not
 enforced. No employers have been taken to court for violating its restrictions on the
 nature of employment for children, and no reports are collected from establishments
 employing children.
 Act No. 1 of 1951 was intended to bring into force certain labor measures, includ-
 ing provisions on child labor which would replace those of the 1925 legislation. How-
 ever, implementing regulations for the child labor provisions have never been i-
 sued. Thus the child labor provisions in the 1951 Act have no validity. In September
 1993, the Government announced it would review its child labor regulations with
 the intention of tightening enforcement of restrictions on child labor. At year's end,
 the review had not been completed.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In the absence of a national minimum wage,
 area wage councils working under the supervision of the national wage council es-
 tablish minimum wages for regions and basic needs figures for each province-a
 monetary amount considered sufficient to enable a single worker to meet the basic
 needs of nutrition, clothing, and shelter. While Indonesia has succeeded in dramati-
 cally lowering the level of poverty thrugout the country, the minimum wage rates
 have lagged behind the basic needs        Minimum   wage rates were raised
 throughout the country in three stages by province on January 1, April 1, and Au-
 gust 1. While in most cases the new rates still did not equal the basic needs figure,
 the Government announced in August that new increases would take place simulta-
 neously throughout the country on April 1, 1995. The Department of Manpower
 projects that at that time minimum wage rates on the average will equal 106 per-
 cent of the basic needs figure, up from 97 percent as of August 1, 1994. Payment
 of the minimum wae is another question. There are no reliable statistics. The Gov-
 ernment's estimate m September, that 96 percent of all companies were paying at
 least the regional minimum wage is certainly exaggerated; independent observers'
 estimates range between 30 and 60 percent. Government enforcement is weak, and
 sanctions are light against employers who fail to pay the minimum wage. Neverthe-
 less, as a result of government pressures, the wave of strikes in the first quarter,
 and the Medan riots, some improvement in the situation seems to have taken place.
 Labor law and ministerial regulations provide workers with a variety of other bene-
 fits, such as social security, and worker in more modern facilities oten receive
 health benefits and free meals.
 The law establishes 7-hour workdays and 40-hour workweeks, with one 30-minute
 rest period for each 4 hours ofwork. The law also requires i day of rest out of every
 week. The daily overtime rate is 11 times the normal hourly rate for the frst hour,
 and twice the hourly rate for additional overtime. Regulations allow employers to
 deviate from the normal work hours upon request to the Minister of Manpower and
 with the agreement of the employee. Observance of laws regulating benefits and
 labor standards varies from sector to sector and by region. Employer violations of
 legal requirements are fairly common and often result in strikes and employee pro-
 tests. The Ministry of Manpower continues publicly to urge employers to comply
 with the law. However, in general, government enforcement and supervision of labor
 standards are weak.
 Both law and regulations provide for minimum standards of industrial health and
 safety. In the largely Western-operated oil sector, safety and health programs func-
 tion reasonably well. However, in the country's 100,000 laer registered ompanies
 in the nonoil sector, the quality of occupational health and safety programs varies
 greatly. The enforcement of health and safety standards is severely hampered by
 the limited number of qualified Department of Manpower inspectors as well. as by
 the low level of employee appreciation for sound health and safety practices. Allega-
 tions of corruption on the part of inspectors are common. Workers are obligated to
 report hazardous working conditions. Employers are forbidden by law from retaliat-
 ing against those who do, but the law is not effectively enforced.
