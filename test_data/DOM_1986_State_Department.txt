 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 The Dominican Republic is a constitutional democracy with a
 popularly elected president and a bicameral congress. The
 Supreme Court heads an independent judiciary whose members are
 appointed by the Senate. The military is fully responsive to
 the civilian governmental authorities and committed to
 constitutional order.
 National elections were held May 16, 1986 for'the sixth
 consecutive time since 1966. Salvador Jorge Blanco completed
 the final year of his 4-year term, turning power over to
 president Joaquin Balaguer Ricardo, leader of the principal
 opposition party and winner of the May elections, on August
 16. Parties representing the political spectrum from left to
 right freely participated; over 70 percent of registered
 voters went to the polls on election day.
 The Dominican Republic is a developing country with a mixed
 economy based primarily on agriculture and services. The
 Government accounts for 20 to 25 percent of the gross domestic
 product and controls several major industries. Historically,
 sugar has been the Dominican Republic's principal export,
 although both tourism and remittances from Dominicans abroad
 now generate more foreign exchange. The Government has
 renegotiated most of its commercial and public bilateral debt,
 and stabilized the market-determined exchange rate.
 Nonetheless, living standards have fallen, especially for the
 poor and lower middle class majority.
 During 1986, Dominicans continued generally to exercise and
 enjoy the broad range of human rights guaranteed them under
 the 1966 Constitution. The political environment remained
 unrestricted, and individuals and political groups freely
 debated and criticized the policies and programs of the
 Government. The May 1986 elections were open, fair, and
 competitive, although there were incidents of political
 violence during the election campaign and in the postelection
 period. While opposition to government economic austerity
 measures led to periodic protests and strikes, and economic
 discontent played a role in the election of Joaquin Balaguer,
 there was no repetition of the violent disturbances of April
 1984.
 Key figures in the ruling party and the new Government,
 including President Balaguer, have publicly affirmed their
 commitment to respect human rights. On several occasions
 since assuming office, the new administration removed military
 and police officers from office and reprimanded them, citing
 human rights abuses as one factor. Government officials have
 also commented on the need to improve prison conditions and to
 curtail the time period between arrest and trial.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Although there were no known cases of government-instigated
 killings in 1986, there were approximately 13 deaths related
 to the May elections. Prior to the elections, there were six
 killings as a result of violent clashes between supporters of
 the two principal political parties, the Dominican
 Revolutionary Party (PRD) and the Social Christian Reformist
 
 
 474
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 Party (PRSC). These deaths were not planned political
 assassinations, but occurred in different parts of the country
 when the two rival political organizations held competing
 campaign events; similar incidents occurred during the 1982
 election campaign. On election day, there were three more
 violent deaths in incidents at two polling places.
 Subsequently, four people were killed during a political
 demonstration by PRD members and Santo Domingo municipal
 workers at the headquarters of the Central Electoral Board
 (JCE) on June 23. As a result of this last incident, the
 commander of security forces at the JCE was summarily
 dismissed from the armed forces and a military investigating
 committee recommended that some 30 other officers and troops
 be sanctioned. In December, while 9 officers were either
 disciplined or retired, a joint military-police tribunal held
 that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute 20 other
 security force members accused of firing on the demonstrators.
 The January 1985 murder case of foreign exchange trader Hector
 Mendez and his chauffeur, in which there were allegations of
 involvement by government and police authorities, remains
 before the courts. The judge hearing the case resigned from
 the bench in August.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no credible reports of politically motivated
 disappearances in 1986.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture, and it is not practiced.
 The press routinely reports cases of police abuse. Prisoners
 and their families have access to the press, a fact that
 encourages the Government to take corrective action. In most
 instances, government and police officials have indicated a
 concern to redress improper behavior by police, but they have
 not always effected the needed changes. In early 1986. there
 were several cases in which the police were accused of both
 beating and murdering protesters or alleged criminals. The
 death of a sugar worker during a January strike and
 confrontation at the state-owned Catarey sugar refinery led to
 the dismissal and prosecution of the policeman involved. In
 addition, a police captain was sentenced to 15 years in prison
 for his involvement in the shooting of 3 brothers. In
 February, an official autopsy revealed that a young man, who
 police had claimed was killed in a motorcycle crash while
 attempting to escape, died as a result of being beaten and
 shot by police authorities. The two officers responsible for
 this action were dishonorably discharged and placed before the
 courts on criminal charges. In March an army-police tribunal
 dismissed charges against two corporals who were under
 investigation for the October 1985 shooting death of
 bandleader Tony Seval while the latter was in police custody.
 The new chief of police, named when the Balaguer Government
 took office in August, has issued instructions reminding
 members of the police that persons detained are entitled to
 "humane and rational treatment."
 The inadequately financed prison system suffers from
 unsanitary conditions and overcrowding. The overcrowding
 results in part from the slowness of the judicial process
 under which many prisoners remain in custody while awaiting
 
 
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 trial. Financial constraints continue to handicap the
 Government's ability to improve the prison situation. The new
 Attorney General has publicly recognized the poor conditions
 in the prisons, including the frequency of tuberculosis
 because of dietary deficiencies and the lack of medicines, and
 has pledged to work to improve the situation.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There are no known instances of arbitrary arrest, illegal
 detention, or exile of individuals for expressing views
 contrary to or critical of the Government. The Constitution
 stipulates that suspects may be detained for a maximum of 48
 hours for investigation before arraignment. After 48 hours,
 those detained must be charged or released, and this
 requirement is routinely observed.  Shortly after assuming
 office in August, the national police chief issued
 instructions reminding all police of this requirement.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are no known political prisoners.
 The Constitution guarantees a public trial. No special court
 for political or national security cases exists, and civilians
 may not be tried by a military court. Members of the armed
 forces are not tried by civilian courts, except under
 specified circumstances and only after a military board has
 reviewed the case and decided to pass it to the civilian
 courts. The appeals procedure, which includes appellate
 courts and the Supreme Court, is widely utilized.
 Court-appointed lawyers normally are provided at public
 expense to indigents only in criminal cases; they are seldom
 provided in criminal misdemeanor cases where their provision
 is at the court's discretion. Prosecuting attorneys are
 appointed by the executive branch.
 Judges at all levels are approved by the Senate. They are
 independent of the executive branch and subject to removal or
 transfer by a majority vote in the Senate. Their terms of
 office correspond to that of the President and other elected
 officials, ending on the last day of the incumbent
 administration regardless of date of appointment. Judges have
 displayed independence in their actions and are not known to
 persecute opponents of the administration. However, judges
 earn a relatively low salary, and the fairness and quickness
 of some trials have been subject to allegations of influence
 and manipulation. There is a widespread public belief,
 buttressed by credible reports, that a number of judges and
 prosecutors at the lower court level accept bribes. The
 Dominican Bar Association in March and June charged some
 judges and prosecutors with corruption and selling sentences.
 The slowness of the judicial system has come under criticism
 from several sectors. The Attorney General reported that only
 18 percent of the inmates in the country's prisons had been
 sentenced by the courts, citing cases where prisoners had
 spent as long as 10 years awaiting trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no reports of arbitrary governmental interference
 with the private lives of individuals or families.
 Constitutional safeguards against invasion of the home
 
 
 476
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 normally are observed. A residence may not be searched except
 in the presence of a prosecutor or an assistant prosecutor,
 excluding cases of "hot pursuit" or in instances where there
 is probable cause to believe that a crime is actually
 occurring within the residence. Because of theft within the
 postal department, there is little public confidence in the
 mail system.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These liberties are guaranteed by law and respected.
 Dominican newspapers are privately owned and freely reflect
 opposition points of view and criticism of the current
 Government. The numerous privately owned radio and television
 stations air all political points of view. Moreover, there
 are frequent exchanges of views between government officials
 and the media.
 There is no government censorship on political grounds.
 However, for 11 days following the May elections, all
 television and radio stations were prohibited from
 broadcasting any information about the elections, including
 the results. During this period the various stations either
 did not broadcast at all, broadcast only music (with no news
 of any kind, national or international), or linked up with the
 official television and radio chain controlled by the Central
 Electoral Board. Newspapers did provide full news coverage of
 election events and other news topics.
 In December 1985, the media and political opposition
 criticized the Government for ordering a commercial television
 station, Channel 13, to remain off the air. The station was
 owned by a prominent political figure of an opposition party.
 The Government stated that the station was ordered not to
 broadcast because of technical irregularities. In July a
 court ruled that there did not exist any legal or technical
 reason to keep Channel 13 off the air. The station began
 broadcasting again in September.
 While customs authorities from time to time confiscate
 Communist literature, books of all political persuasions are
 readily available for public sale. University autonomy and
 academic freedom are respected by the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution. Outdoor
 public marches and meetings require official government
 permits, which are granted routinely. Throughout 1986--
 especially during the pre-election campaign period--there were
 numerous such gatherings of parties and groups of diverse
 political orientations. Indoor gatherings of political
 parties, labor unions, and other associations are unrestricted.
 Labor unions historically have not played a significant role
 in the Dominican Republic, and less than 15 percent of the
 labor force is organized.
 The trade union movement is fragmented--there are eight
 recognized national labor confederations--and, except for the
 National Confederation of Dominican Workers (CNTD), highly
 politicized. Moreover, the confederations exercise only a
 limited degree of control over their affiliates. In 1986, 229
 
 
 477
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 new unions were formed and officially recognized. Several of
 the confederations are affiliated with-regional and
 international labor organizations.
 A significant portion of Dominican organized labor is
 Communist controlled or influenced. The politically
 affiliated organizations frequently pursue partisan objectives
 rather than workers' economic demands. The Government on
 occasion has briefly detained labor union leaders in order to
 stop strikes or other labor actions it considered illegal.
 Rising unemployment--28 percent for 1986--and the
 deterioration of the nation's economy have hampered the growth
 of organized labor. Unions have the right to negotiate and to
 strike, but operate under the handicap of a dated labor code,
 written during the Trujillo dictatorship, that gives unions
 few rights vis-a-vis management. For example, there is no
 effective protection for organizers or union officials.
 Proposed legislation to modernize the labor code and
 strengthen worker rights remained stalled in Congress in 1986.
 Professional organizations of lawyers, doctors, journalists,
 and others function freely. Like the unions, these
 organizations are free to maintain relations with counterpart
 international bodies of diverse political philosophies.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Discrimination on racial, religious, or ethnic grounds is
 prohibited by the Constitution. There are no religious
 requirements to hold public office, no restrictions on the
 practice of religious faiths, and no social discrimination
 based on religion. However, approximately 95 percent of the
 population is Roman Catholic, and the Church's preeminent
 position is accepted by the populace at large and is
 recognized in the Concordat between the Dominican Republic and
 the Holy See.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no unusual restrictions on travel within or outside
 the country. Many political exiles returned after an amnesty
 in 1978, but a legal ban on the return of certain members of
 the family of Rafael Trujillo, a former dictator, still exists
 The status and treatment of Haitians living in the Dominican
 Republic have been criticized by the press and private groups,
 both in the Dominican Republic and abroad. The Haitian
 community of approximately 500,000 is composed mainly of
 illegal immigrants seeking employment and better living
 conditions. This figure also includes approximately 800
 individuals, mostly opponents of former Haitian President
 Duvalier, who have received "political refugee" status from
 the Dominican Government.
 Following the fall of the Duvalier regime in February, the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, cooperating
 with the Dominican and Haitian Governments, arranged for the
 voluntary repatriation of several hundred of these political
 refugees to Haiti.
 In addition, there were another 1,000 de facto (but
 unrecognized) political refugees. Illegal immigrants
 routinely are deported under Dominican immigration law, while
 those seeking political refuge are not repatriated if the
 
 
 478
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 Government determines that they have a legitimate fear of
 persecution. There are restrictions against foreigners
 engaging in political activity directed against another
 country.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Dominican Republic is a functioning multiparty democracy
 in which governments are freely elected by the citizenry.
 Opposition groups of the left, right, and center operate
 openly and participated in the 1986 election campaign. The
 May elections, in which the ruling party was defeated, and the
 subsequent peaceful transfer of power in August, demonstrate
 the established right of the electorate to change its
 government freely. Elections are administered by the Central
 Electoral Board, an independent government body.
 Nearly three-quarters of the registered electorate voted on
 May 16, selecting national, provincial and municipal office
 holders. The large voter turnout and active participation of
 the two principal parties and the pro-Cuban Dominican
 Liberation Party in the Dominican Congress underline the
 favorable climate for political pluralism.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Dominican Republic participates actively in international
 and regional human rights bodies and supports efforts to
 promote human rights in international forums. International
 human rights organizations have been-allowed free access to
 the country.
 In response to a complaint by the International Confederation
 of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) concerning the infringement of
 union rights during the January Catarey sugar refinery strike,
 which resulted in the death of a union activist, the
 Government acknowledged that a policeman was involved. He
 later was dismissed from the police force and is facing court
 proceedings. Private organizations which freely report and
 comment on alleged human rights violations include the
 Dominican Human Rights Committee and the Dominican Union for
 the Defense of Human Rights. The major allegation of these
 organizations in 1986 was that the Government was forcing
 Haitian residents to participate in the cutting of sugar cane
 against their will. In addition, a new human rights group
 organized in July, the National Committee of Human and Labor
 Rights, is closely associated with the National Confederation
 of Dominican Workers, an ICFTU affiliate.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Sexual and racial discrimination are prohibited by law and
 women's political rights have been recognized in legislation
 since 1941. Forty-seven percent of registered voters are
 women, and women hold both elective and appointed offices in
 the Government. Women remain a minority in government
 offices, but President Balaguer designated women governors for
 8 of the country's 29 provinces. Divorce is easily obtainable
 by either spouse, and women can hold property in their own
 names apart from their husbands. Nonetheless, women
 
 
 479
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 traditionally have not shared equal social and economic status
 or opportunity with men.
 There is subtle social discrimination against darker skinned
 Dominicans, although this has not prevented their success in a
 variety of fields, including elected political office.
 Dominicans, for historical reasons and because of sharp
 cultural differences, generally are prejudiced against
 Haitians. This prejudice carries over to a minority in the
 population who are Dominicans of Haitian descent. These
 prejudices, social tensions, and historical enmities sometimes
 result in violence against the Haitian community in the
 country.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Dominican labor code prohibits employment of youths under
 14 years of age, and restricts the nighttime employment of
 youths ages 14-18. The labor code also provides that
 employees under 18 work no more than 8 hours a day, and, in
 addition to other limits on youth employment, specifies that
 those 18 years and younger will not be employed in dangerous
 or unhealthy jobs. In practice, many of the restrictions in
 the labor code are ignored. Young people, including minors
 less than 14, engage in a wide variety of work which
 technically violates the labor regulations. For example, the
 labor code's provisions regulating vendors and shoeshine boys
 are not enforced.
 The labor code establishes that all workers are entitled to 24
 hours of rest after 6 days of work; in practice, a typical
 work week is Monday through Friday plus half a day on
 Saturday. Safety and health conditions at the workplace do
 not always meet acceptable standards. The existing social
 security system is inadequate, and legislation to expand and
 improve it has remained stalled in the Congress.
 In 1985 the Government, recognizing the hardships entailed by
 the rising cost of living, took steps to raise the basic
 minimum monthly salary from 175 to 250 pesos (about US$63 to
 US$89 at the current exchange rate) for both public and
 private sector employees. Some smaller businesses are exempt
 from the new pay scale. At the same time, the minimum daily
 wage for agricultural workers was raised from 5 to 6 pesos.
 Action by the executive branch preserved this 250 peso minimum
 wage for public sector employees through 1986.
 The Government and the State Sugar Board (CEA) did not
 contract seasonal sugarcane cutters from Haiti for the 1985-86
 harvest. However, charges were leveled by the Catholic Church
 and some political parties, labor organizations, and human
 rights groups that the Government forced Haitians--generally
 illegally resident--to engage in cane cutting. In a written
 declaration dated February 23, the Dominican Episcopal
 Conference of the Roman Catholic Church declared that Haitians
 living in the Dominican Republic, including both legal and
 illegal residents, "are being taken against their will to cut
 cane." The Government denied the charge, while affirming that
 many Haitians, together with Dominicans, voluntarily were
 engaged in such activities.
