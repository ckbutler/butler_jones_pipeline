 NAMIBIA*
 South Africa administers Namibia, originally under a League of
 Nations mandate (1920-1966) and since 1966 illegally on a de
 facto basis. Executive power over the territory rests with the
 Administrator General, appointed by the South African Government.
 Beginning in 1980, considerable authority was transferred to
 an interim three-tier system of elected representatives, divid-
 ing governing responsibility between central, ethnic, and local
 authorities. Throughout 1982, at the central government ("first-
 tier") level, the Council of Ministers -- a 15-member body drawn
 from the 50-member National Assembly -- served as the day-to-day
 executive authority in Namibia, although the Administrator Gen-
 eral, as the representative of the South African Government,
 reserved the power to issue proclamations with the force of law.
 South Africa retained police, defense, and customs relations
 -powers. The Council of Ministers and National Assembly had
 authority over all matters not reserved to South Africa, but the
 Administrator General maintained a veto authority over any of
 their actions. The Council of Ministers and National Assembly --
 never recognized as legitimate institutions by the United States,
 the United Nations, or the international community -- were -
 dissolved in-January 1983, and the Administrator General resumed
 direct rule.
 The "second-tier" authorities-- separate elected bodies repre-
 -senting each of the 12 officially designated population groups
 .except the-Bushmen, ,who are wadinistered'directly by the central
 -Government -- exercise semiautonomous authority in areas deter-
 mined by the Administrator General. Not all of the ethnic
 authorities have equal power, however, and, under this system,
 whites prosper disproportionately in comparison with other ethnic
 groups. The "third-tier" authorities, such as municipal govern-
 ments and village management boards, are limited to providing
 local services.
 The judicial structure in the territory comprises two overlapping
 systems -- one for whites, westernized blacks, and persons of
 mixed race, and one for indigenous African people.
 During 1982, the state of human rights in Namibia continued to
 reflect South Africa's rule of the territory, as well as the
 effects of continued military hostilities.
 Since mid-1966 the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)
 has sought to force the withdrawal of South Africa from Namibia.
 SWAPO's efforts have been partly political and partly military,
 entailing a low-level guerrilla war in the densely-inhabited'
 northern part of the territory along the Angolan border. Martial
 law is in effect in this region, and there is a substantial South
 Africa-Defense Force presence. SWAPO tends to operate from its
 !main.bases in Angola in' small-unit guerrilla activities. In turn,
 the South Africans and the South West Africa Territorial Force
 engage in local counterinsurgency action inside Namibia and
 strike periodically and sometimes deeply across the border-in an
 effort to disrupt SWAPO capabilitiesand infrastructure. The
 activities of both sides in the conflict have a predictably
 negative impact-on the lives of the people of Namibia. There are
 persistent reports of intimidation and abuse of the local popula-
 -tion by both sides, and civilians are frequently caught in
 crossfire between the two forces.
 4There is no United States mission in.Namibia, and the United
 States Government has only limited information about the human
 rights situation there.

 1982 was marked by a continuing debate among the Namibian internal
 parties and the South African Government over elimination of
 remaining forms of institutionalized discrimination in Namibia.
 Resumption of direct rule by the Administrator General has left
 this question unresolved.
 The past year also saw continued progress in the diplomatic
 initiative to bring about a peaceful, internationally recognized
 settlement in Namibia, begun in 1977 by the five Western members
 of the Security Council at that time -- the United States,
 the United Kingdom, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, and
 Canada. The United States believes that the success of this
 initiative is central to the positive evolution of human rights
 in Namibia.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There have been a number of reports of killings of civilians by
 untrained special constables used as bodyguards by senior offi-
 cials in northern Namibia (Ovambo). Particularly grisly photo-
 graphs of one such killing of an entire family were published
 in the Windhoek press in September 1982. The motive for such
 atr6cities is commonly reported to be robbery. There have also
 been reports that SWAPO guerrillas were responsible for the
 shooting death of a Windhoek farmer in the Tsumeb region in
 April. The perpetrators of the crime were reportedly shot to
 death by police in November 1982. During 1982 a number of
 deaths -- both civilian and military -- were also attributable
 to land mines allegedly placed by SWAPO.
 b. Disappearance
 Disappearances in Namibia are a function of the conflict situa-
 tion, flight from the country, and the operation of martial law
 and South African security legislation. Incommunicado detentions
 still occur, and the Government continues to withhold information
 about detainees, making it difficult to judge their frequency or
 duration. In 1981 the Government instituted a military draft
 for all Namibians, black and white, to provide conscripts for
 the recently constituted South West Africa Territorial Force.
 There are reports that up to several thousand young Namibians
 have fled the country to avoid military service.
 There are also reports of SWAPO kidnappings of young people to
 fill their military ranks. Persons sympathetic to SWAPO assert
 that most young people leave the territory willingly, but this
 cannot be confirmed. There are also unconfirmed allegations that
 persons suspected of SWAPO activities are arrested and removed to
 distant parts of Namibia with no notification to family members.
 c. Torture
 South African authorities, operating under, inter alia, the
 Terrorism Act, the Internal Security Act, and the relevant proc-
 lamations of the Administrator General, have broad police powers
 to arrest, detain, and interrogate people. Over the years, there
 have been a number of reports that South African police and mili-
 tary authorities have abused, mishandled, and, in certain cases,
 tortured prisoners. These accusations have been supported by
 local religious leaders, as well as by other visiting clergymen
 from South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
 Churchmen, particularly in northern Namibia, have complained that
 suspected SWAPO members are subjected by the police to torture,
 including deprivation of water in desert conditions for periods
 
 
 298
 of up to 30 hours. During 1982 reports alleging widespread tor-
 ture were issued by the Southern African Catholic Bishops' Con-
 ference, the British Council of Churches, and leaders of the
 South African Council of Churches. In December 1982, Amnesty
 International issued a report which charged South Africa with
 torturing prisoners and called for an independent judicial
 inquiry into reports of the use of electric shock, beatings,
 and other forms of torture. Verification of these reports is,
 however, extremely difficult given conditions in the territory
 and the nature of South African security legislation. There are
 also reports of similar abuses perpetrated by SWAPO.
 Torture has most frequently occurred immediately after arrest
 and has usually been perpetrated by police irregulars or by
 members of "Koevoet", a police unit officially described as
 having a counterinsurgency function. With the announced aim of
 stopping such incidents, the South African Defense Force estab-
 lished in September 1982, in cooperation with the Ovambo Chief
 Minister, a special commission to review the behavior of security
 forces in the northern "operational" area. Although efforts to
 punish those responsible for torture have been limited, the
 existence of this commission and the semi-public review of cases
 referred to it have reportedly improved the behavior of security
 forces in general. However, in November 1982 two men detained
 by the police in Kavango died within hours of their arrest.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading-Treatment or Punishment
 As noted above, the civilian population in. the "operational"area
 is subject to harassment, abuse, and intimidation from both sides.
 South African security legislation (e.g. Terrorism Act, Internal
 Security Act) has been repromulgated for Namibia by the Adminis-
 trator General. The Internal Security Act also extends to
 Namibia the Government's power to "ban" individuals. However,
 this-power is used infrequently. The Vice President of SWAPO is
 serving his second five-year ban, and is restricted to a township
 outside Walvis Bay.
 The South African Bishops Conference issued a report in May 1982
 which detailed allegations of wide-spread atrocities by South
 African soldiers pursuing guerrillas in Namibia. In one case, a
 church service in Ondanga was allegedly interrupted by the arriv-
 al of two unregistered trucks full of soldiers who proceeded to
 interrogate and beat the men in an effort to get information
 on SWAPO activities.
 Conditions in established jails and prisons, including the deten-
 tion center at Mariental, are described by the International
 Committee of the Red Cross as comparable to those in similar
 South African facilities. As far as can be determined, prisoners
 are treated more or less the same, regardless of offense, once in
 these formal facilities. Most incidents of abuse occur while
 prisoners are in police custody, immediately after arrest.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Several laws and proclamations in effect in Namibia permit arbi-
 * trary arrest without access to the courts or to lawyers. It is
 ;difficult to estimate the number of people so detained, although
 several hundred may be held at any one time. Most of these people
 .are alleged supporters of the internal wing of SWAPO, which is
 allowed to operate as a political party. For example, a number
 of.-internal SWAPO officials were detained under Administrator
 General Proclamation Number 9 for varying periods of time follow-
 ing disorders at a 1981 SWAPO Namibia Day (August 26) rally in
 KatuturaTownship, outside Windhoek. Presently, several hundred
 SWAPO members taken prisoner during the South Africa Defense
 
 
 299
 Force raid on Cassinga, Angola in May 1978 remain as detainees
 in southern Namibia. Since the South African Government does
 not accord these people prisoner of war status, yet cannot con-
 vict them of ordinary crimes, they remain in indefinite deten-
 tion as political prisoners.
 Detainees are sometimes freed under "release warrants" which
 impose restrictions on movements and public statements similar
 to "banning" under the Internal Security Act. Although the
 police decline to release statistics on the number of "release
 warrants" in effect, the practice is believed to be fairly fre-
 quent as a form of conditional release.
 f. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 Under South African law and the terms of martial law in the same
 areas which inhibit access to civil courts, the right to a fair
 and public trial is seriously impaired. If a defendant is actu-
 ally brought to trial, he has the right to and can generally ob-
 tain effective counsel, and charges are usually clearly stated
 at the time of formal arraignment. Since no state of war has
 been declared in Namibia, those charged with offenses are tried
 in civil courts, including on charges of violations of the
 Terrorism Act or the Internal Security Act. As far as can
 be determined, no SWAPO guerrillas or political activists have
 been tried by military court.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Invasion of the home by South African security forces is still
 common, especially in the northern "operational" area. The
 legal requirement for a civil court warrant to search a private
 home is superseded in many cases by the terms of the security
 legislation and powers of the military under martial law. In
 urban areas, surveillance is still common, including electronic
 surveillance of political activists.
 2. Respect for Civil-and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 A series of laws circumscribe individual rights to free speech,
 press, and association. South African security legislation,
 which is enforced by the police, prevents publication of mater-
 ial which is embarrassing to the state or which concerns anything
 defined as a military or security matter, without permission of
 the pertinent military or police authorities. Such matters
 include the names of persons detained and the charges against
 them, if any.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The limited freedom of association previously permitted in
 Namibia for recognized opponents of the authorities, including
 SWAPO, was sharply curtailed during 1981 with the passage of
 the "Prohibition and Notification of Meetings Act." This legis-
 lation, aimed at curbing SWAPO political activities, requires
 all political parties in the territory to abjure forever acts
 of violence or taking up arms to bring about political change.
 The Act has prevented SWAPO from holding meetings of more than
 20 persons and has been applied with similar effect against other
 parties which also regard themselves as liberation movements.
 Namibia has six labor unions. All are registered nationally
 and are nominally nonracial. However, few union members are
 black, and, in recent yearsp there has been little evidence
 of black labor militancy in Namibia.

 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although formal recognition of freedom of religion is observed,
 clergymen from most of the Christian churches represented in
 Namibia report that they have been harassed because of pro-SWAPO
 sympathies or statements critical of the South African presence
 in the territory. One recent case of brutality involving South
 Africa Defense Force officers and civilians in Ovambo resulted in
 a court martial in 1982 of at least one Defense Force officer,
 with other trials pending. However, authorities have still not
 assigned responsibility for other incidents, including the 1980
 bombing of a church printing press in Ovambo or the fire which
 destroyed an Anglican seminary at Odipo.
 There is no provision under the military conscription system,
 which was instituted in 1981, for conscientious objection to
 military service.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement in Namibia is restricted to some extent by
 the various security regulations in effect (curfews, etc.) and
 the military situation in the north. With the abolition of the
 pass requirement, however, the system can be said to be less
 rigorous than that applied in South Africa.
 Despite the fact that the South African Government and Namibian
 authorities no longer formally adhere to a system of exclusive
 geographic areas for each of the ethnic groups, some measures in
 pursuit of that objective continue to be undertaken. For exam-
 ple, in 1981 a number of Bushman communities in the Ravango
 region were, on short notice and against their will, relocated
 by the South Africa Defense Force.
 For practical purposes, travel regulations which the South
 African Government imposes on blacks and whites in South Africa
 apply as well to Namibians. Movement between South Africa and
 Namibia is unrestricted for whites, but controlled for blacks.
 Movement within Namibia is generally unrestricted. Foreign
 travel by blacks affiliated with SWAPO is frequently restricted,
 and internal SWAPO leaders have often appealed to western govern-
 ments to intercede with the South African Government to obtain
 passports. Other black Namibians appear to be able to obtain
 passports for study abroad or political meetings.,
 In northern Namibia, frequent use of land mines, reportedly by
 SWAPO, inhibits movement by local inhabitants. Fear of SWAPO has
 led one prominent non-SWAPO political leader to employ full-time
 bodyguards.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 South Africa's administration of Namibia, which includes the
 exercise of executive power by a South African-appointed Admin-
 istrator General, severely restricts effective participation
 in the political process.
 Except for restrictions imposed by the "Prohibition and Notifi-
 cation of Meetings Act", there are no curbs on political activi-
 ties by any political group as such, and even SWAPO remains an
 active political party in Namibia. However, its internal wing
 has been largely moribund since 1979, when its entire leadership
 was detained simultaneously by the South African Government.
 
 301
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human.Rights
 The South African Government's ambiguous attitude toward external
 critics of the republic's domestic policies is reflected in its
 actions in Namibia. South Africa has allowed critics of its
 rule in Namibia, such as the Lutheran Council and a commission
 of Catholic bishops, to travel to Namibia and make contact with
 the various opponents of the regime. However, the South African
 Government has taken public exception to some of their more out-
 spoken criticisms; and other groups, such as the American Bar
 Association, have not been allowed to travel to Namibia. From
 time to time, outside pressure is heeded, such as in the 1981
 commutation of the death sentence of Marcus Kateka, who was con-
 victed of complicity in a SWAPO attack on a white-owned farm.
 However, in general the security system in Namibia is not
 responsive to outside criticism.
 In its September 1982 briefing paper on Namibiav Amnesty Inter-
 national expressed its continued concern over the use of deten-
 tion without trial, administrative restriction, allegations of
 torture, and ill-treatment of political prisoners.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 With respect to South Africa's application of apartheid to
 Namibia, the International Court of Justice recorded in a 1971
 advisory opinion that South Africa adopted "restrictive measures
 of control" establishing "limitations, exclusions or restric-
 tions for the members of the indigenous populations groups...
 It found South Africa's conduct "based on grounds of race,
 colour, descent or national or ethnic origin" to be "a denial of
 fundamental human rights" and "a flagrant violation of the
 purposes and principles of the (United Nations) Charter." Since
 1971, concrete steps have been taken to eliminate certain of the
 distinctions referred to by the Court. Restrictions on freedom
 of assembly and association have been somewhat relaxed, although
 important legal restrictions still exist which separate persons
 on racial and ethnic grounds.
 There has been some relaxation since 1977 of the strict legal
 requirement for racial segregation in Namibia. This is the case,
 for example, in most restaurants and hotels. However, segrega-
 tion remains the rule in the case of public services provided by
 the ethnically-based second-tier governments, e.g., health and
 education, and in public services directly contolled by South
 African authorities, e.g., the railroads.
 In Namibia a highly developed infrastructure exists in conjunc-
 tion with a traditional African society. While the division no
 longer fully parallels the racial division in the country, a
 substantial degree of parallelism continues to exist. This is
 because key governmental sectors, such as health and education,
 are under the control of the ethnically-based second-tier govern-
 ments. As a result, the substantial difference in services
 provided to black and white Namibians in the past has not been
 fundamentally changed.
 The population of Namibia is between one and 1.25 million, 90 per-
 cent black and 10 percent white. The population growth rate was
 3.0 percent in 1980. Life expectancy at birth is approximately
 50 years, and the infant mortality rate (1980 figure) is 120/1000
 live births. Literacy figures are 100 percent for whites and 38
 percent for blacks, with school attendance following roughly the
 same configuration. GNP (1980 estimate) is approximately $1.4
 billion, but has been declininq since 1978. Per capita income of
 
 
 302
 roughly $1,400 belies the structure of the economy, which is sharp-
 ly divided along racial lines between those who participate in the
 modern market sector and those in the traditional subsistence sec-
 tor. The economic outlook continues to be less optimistic than
 in previous years. Namibia has been experiencing problems with a
 long-term drought, over-fishing, and a soft world demand for its
 three principal mineral resources--diamonds, copper, and uranium.
