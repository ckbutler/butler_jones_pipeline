 ICELAND
 Iceland is a constitutional republic and a multiparty parliamentary democracy. Its
 literate and educated people participate in high percentages in regular fair and free
 elections which determine the distribution of power among political parties and
 leaders. The civil and criminal justice systems offer equal protection to all.
 The nation has no indigenous military forces or political security apparatus.
 Iceland has a mixed and open economy in which all of its citizens enjoy the right
 to hold private property.
 Icelanders have long been strong defenders of human rghts both at home and
 internationally, and the country has an exemplary human rights record.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Exirajudiciol Killing.-Extrajudicial killings do not occur.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no instances of abductions or disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are all
 prohibited by law and do not occur.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Due procsss provided by law and ob-
 served in practice. The Constitution states that any person arrested by the authoi-
 ties must be brought before a judge without undue delay. The judge must rule with.
 in 24 hours whether the person is to be detained. Although the Constitution allows
 for bail, it is not usually imposed as a condition for release. A judge s ruling may
 be appealed immediately to a higher court. Preventive detention is not practiced.
 There were no allegations of arbitrary detention. There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-Defendants may confront witnesses and otherwise
 participate in public trials, which are fair and free from intimidation. They are
 gUaranteed the right to competent legal counsel of their own choice. In cases where
 the defendants are unable to pay attorneys fees, the State does so. The courts are
 
 
 free of political control. While the Ministry of Justice administers the lower court
 system, the Supreme Court carefully guards its independence and fairness. Juries
 are not normally used, but multijudge panels are common, especially in the appeals
 process. There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 the Constitution and in practice there is deep respect for the autonomy and rights
 of individuals. A warrant from a court is required for entry into a home except in
 cases of hot pursuit. Arbitrary intrusions by official entities, political organizations,
 or any other organized group into the private beliefs or personal liberties of individ-
 uals do not occur.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution expressly forbids censorship
 and other restrictions on the freedom of the press and on a person's right to express
 his thoughts. Citizens and the media exercise these freedoms extensively. Academic
 freedom of expression is vigorously exercised.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to assemble unarmed, except when it is feared that such gatherings may
 cause riots. In practice, plans for public meetings are virtually never rejected, and
 the authorities only rarely modify them. In addition, the Constitution provides that
 citizens have the right to join together formally or informally to form associations
 without governmental authorization. A varied and wide spectrum of voluntary orga-
 nizations plays a vital role in Icelandic politics and society.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Most citizens are members of the Lutheran Church, but
 there is complete freedom for other faiths. Members of both Christian and non-
 Christian faiths are allowed to proselytize freely. They may maintain ties with, and
 receive support from, coreligionsts abroad.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Iclanders are free to travel at home and abroad, to emigrate, and to
 return at will. Refugees are never compelled to return to a country in which they
 would face persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The political system is an open, fully functioning parliamentary democracy in
 which voters freely choose the members of the Althing (Parliament) who, in turn,
 make the laws of the land and determine the composition of the Cabinet. Parliamen-
 tary elections are held at 4-year intervals unless the Althing dissolves itself before
 the end of its full term. Voting in elections and membership in the various political
 parties are open to all citizens who are 18 years of age or older. Primary elections
 and party caucuses are used to select Althing candidates. Multimember districts and
 proportional representation increase the chances for minority points of view to be
 represented. In addition, there is a strong cultural insistence on having the views
 of all significant gups represented in the Althing. Currently five political parties
 are represented. The center/right coalition Government, formed following national
 elections in April 1991, consists of the Independence Party and the Social Demo-
 cratic Party. David Oddsson of the Independence Party is Prime Minister.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights associations are active in Iceland. The Government and populace
 support international efforts to improve human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Iceland's ethnically homogeneous population is fiercely egalitarian and, as a mat-
 ter of principle, is opposed to discrimination based on sex, religion, or any other fac-
 tors. Government legislation and practice reflect this attitude. However, Iceland's
 record is not perfect in this respect.
 Both physical and mental violence occurs against women. The problem is gradu-
 ally receiving greater public attention through the efforts of the Women's List politi-
 cal party, which raises the issue periodically in political debate, as well as through
 efforts of other concerned women's organizations. A public women's shelter operates
 in Reykjavik and offers protection to approximately 320 women and 150 children
 per year. There is also a rape trauma center sponsored and operated by women's
 organizations, including those that operate the women's shelter. Both are supported
 financially by national and municipal governments and private contributions. Ap-
 proximately 400 women and children (aged 3 to 70) annually receive assistance at
 the rape trauma center. There were dramatic increases in 1992 in the number of
 clients seekinu protection and assistance at both the shelter and the rape trauma
 
 
 center (78 percent and 31 percent, respectively). Approximately 50 percent of those
 who make use of the shelter cite alcohol abuse by their male partners as a factor
 contributing to the violence they suffer. Counseling is available from social workers
 and lawyers at the shelter.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers in Iceland have, and make extensive use
 of, the right to establish organizations, draw up their own constitutions and rules,
 choose their own leaders and policies, and publicize their views. The trade unions
 are not controlled by the Government or any single political party. Unions take an
 active part in Nordic, European, and international trade union bodies. With the ex-
 ception of limited categories of workers in the public sector whose services are es-
 sential to public health or safety (e.g., air traffic controllers), unions have had, and
 have used for many years, the right to strike. Only three labor unions went on
 strike in 1992: the Union of Natural Scientists (for 24 hours in February),
 playschool workers in the northwest (for 6 days in February and March), and mem-
 ers of the Merchant Fleet and Fishing Vessel Officers Guild (for 15 hours in May).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Approximately 76 percent of
 all eligible workers belong to unions. There are no impediments to union member-
 ship in law or in practice. Virtually all unions exercise their right to bargain collec-
 tively on wages, workingconditions, and related issues. Labor courts effectively ad-
 judicate disputes over labor contracts and over the rights and provisions guaranteed
 under the 1938 Act on Trade Unions and Industrial Disputes, which prohibits
 antiunion discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones or other special economic zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The employment of children below
 the ae of 16 in factories, on ships, and in other places that are hazardous or re-
 quirehard labor is prohibited by law, and this prohibition is observed in practice.
 Children of 14 and 15 years of age may be employed in light, nonhazardous work,
 but their work hours may not exceed the ordinary working hours of adults in the
 same occupation. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration enforces child
 labor regulations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Icelandic workers are protected by laws that
 effectively ensure their health and safety, as well as provide for unemp oyment in-
 surance, paid vacations, pensions, and reasonable working conditions and hours.
 The standard legal workweek is 40 hours. Although there is no minimum wage law,
 union membership is so pervasive and effective that labor contracts, in effect assure
 even the lowest paid workers a sufficient income for a decent standard of living.
 Health and safety standards are set by the Althing and administered and enforced
 by the Ministry of Social Affairs through its Occupational Safety and Health Admin-
 istration. Food, shelter, health care, and education are all guaranteed without dis-
 crimination to those lacking adequate income because of age, illness, or other rea-
 sons.
