 LIBERIA
 Liberia is a centralized republic dominated by a strong presidency. Although the
 Constitution provides for three branches of government, there is no effective system
 of checks and balances, and presidents traditionally have wielded extraordinary
  ower. Americo-Liberians, descendents of freed African-American slaves from the
 nited States and the Caribbean who make up about 5 percent of the population,
 dominated the country's government through the True Whig Party until 1980, when
 Sergeant Samuel K Doe, a member of the indigenous Krahn ethnic group, seized
 power in a military coup. Doe was killed by rebels in 1990 at the start of a 7-year-
 long ethnically divisive civil war, which was ended by the Abuja Peace Accords in
 1996, and from which forces led by Charles G. Taylor, who is of both indigenous
 and Americo-Liberian ancestry, emerged dominant. In July 1997 Taylor won the
 presidency, and his National Patriotic Party (NPP) won three-quarters of the seats
 in the Congress, in elections that were administratively free and transparent, but
 were conducted in an atmosphere of intimidation, as most voters believed that Tay-
 lor's forces would resume fighting if Taylor were to lose. The leaders of the former
 warring factions, including Taylor, did not make any serious attempt to reconcile
 their differences. In his first year in office, Taylor restored the trappings and cere-
 mony customarily associated with the presidency, but his NPP Government did not
 pass any significant legislation. The judiciary is subject to political influence, eco-
 nomic pressure, and corruption.
 The regular security forces included: the armed forces; the national police, which
 have primary responsibility for internal security; the Special Security Service (SSS),
 a large and heavily armed executive protective force; as well as numerous other ir-
 regular security services attached to certain key ministries and parastatal corpora-
 tions, the responsibilities of which appeared poorly defined. The national- army,
 which fought against Taylor's faction during the civil war, has yet to be downsized
 and restructured as required by the Abuja Peace Accords, although a restructuring
 plan exists. Only a few contingents have been deployed to maintain security in parts
 of rural areas. The many, newly created security services absorbed Taylor's most ex-
 perienced civil war fighters. Armed units within these services consisted almost ex-
 clusively of undisciplined Taylor loyalists. Remnants of ECOMOG, the West African
 peacekeeping force deployed around greater Monrovia, interceded on several occa-
 sions to contain violence triggered in part by the government security forces. While
 civilian authorities generally maintained control of the security forces, there were
 frequent instances in which the security forces acted independently of government
 authority. Members of the security forces committed numerous human rights
 abuses.
 Liberia is a very poor country with a market-based economy that is only begin-
 ning to recover from the ravages of the civil war. There is no reliable data on aver-
 age per capita income, but it is estimated at only a small fraction of the prewar
 level. Prior to 1990, the cash economy was based primarily on iron ore, rubber, tim-
 ber, diamond, and gold exports. Eighty-five percent unemployment, a 15 percent lit-
 eracy rate, the continued internal displacement of civilians, and the absence of in-
 frastructure throughout the country continued to depress productive capacity, de-
 spite the country's rich natural resources and potential self-sufficiency in food. Gov-
 ernment officials and former combatants continued to exploit the country's natural
 resources for personal benefit. Extortion is a widespread phenomenon in all strata
 of society.
 The Government's human rights record was poor, with serious problems in many
 areas. The security forces committed many extrajudicial killings. Police shot and
 killed suspects in custody, and security forces on September 18 encircled and killed
 perhaps hundreds of ethnic Krahns who were affiliated with a faction that opposed
 
 
 232
 
 Taylor during the civil war. Members of the SSS were implicated in the disappear-
 ance and apparent murder of a market woman. Security forces tortured, beat and
 otherwise abused or humiliated citizens. The Government investigated some of the
 alleged abuses by the security forces, but in all cases in which officers were charged,
 they either were treated leniently or exonerated. Prison conditions in all 13 counties
 were harsh, and in the case of Gbarnga Central Prison, life threatening. Security
 forces continued at times to use arbitrary arrest and detention, and lengthy pretrial
 detention remained common. The judicial system, hampered by inefficiency, corrup-
 tion, and a lack of resources, was unable to ensure citizens' rights to due process
 and a fair trial. In some rural areas where the judiciary had not been reestablished,
 clan chieftains administered criminal justice through the traditional practice of
 trial-by-ordeal; at times authorities tacitly condoned this practice. The security
 forces violated citizens' privacy rights, conducting warrantless searches and looting
 homes. The Government restricted freedom of the press, temporarily closing private
 newspapers and radio stations, stopping the printing of a private newspaper, flog-
 ging a journalist, and threatening other journalists critical of the Government. Secu-
 rity forces restricted freedom of movement, using roadblocks to extort money from
 travelers and returning refugees. The Government postponed local elections. Secu-
 rity forces frequently harassed human rights activists. Violence and discrimination
 against women, and violence against children remained problems. The education
 and care of children remained widely neglected, and the civil-war-era decline in fe-
 male genital mutilation (FGM) began to be reversed. Societal ethnic discrimination
 remained widespread, ethnic differences continued to generate violence and political
 tensions, and the Government continued to discriminate against indigenous ethnic
 groups that had opposed Taylor in the civil war, including the Krahn ethnic group.
 Forced labor, including by children, persisted in rural areas. Child labor remained
 widespread. Ritualistic killings also persisted.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political-and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Security forces committed a substan-
 tial number of extrajudicial killings during the year; most were killings of ethnic
 Krahn on or after September 18.
 On the night of January 8-9, a police unit tasked with curbing a wave of armed
 robberies, went to the home of a former rebel commander, Mannah Zekay. Eye-
 witnesses claim that the police took Zekay, clad only in underwear, into custody
 along with an associate, Weah Saydee. At one stage during his detention, Zekay
 broke free from the police and ran to an ECOMOG checkpoint for protection. The
 French-speaking soldiers on duty did not understand Zekay's plea for help and re-
 turned him to police custody. On the morning of January 9, the police displayed the
 bullet-riddled bodies of two men at police headquarters and announced that the
 antirobbery task force had killed them in a heavy exchange of gunfire. No policemen
 were wounded. Zekay's skull appeared to have been fractured with a blunt instru-
 ment. There was no official investigation and no autopsy.
 On the night of February 8, the antirobbery task force went to a displaced persons
 camp in Brewerville in search of an alleged armed robber, John Nimely. They found
 Nimely and took him to police headquarters for questioning. The following morning,
 the police displayed his body and announced that he had been killed while trying
 to escape from police custody. The cause of death appeared to be a single gunshot
 to the back of Nimely's head. According to the police, Nimely admitted under inter-
 rogation to a string of armed robberies and the rae of two women. He volunteered
 to accompany a squad of officers to a cemetery where he had a weapons cache. At
 the cemetery, Nimely allegediy removed a loaded weapon from the cache and opened
 fire on the police officers. The police allegediy returned fire, killing Nimely. No po-
 licemen were injured. There was no official investigation and no autopsy.
 During the year, many persons were killed in clashes between government forces
 and the forces of Roosevelt Johnson, the only one of the warlords who had fought
 against Taylor during the civil war and still remained in the country. Until Septem-
 ber Johnson and a substantial number of his former fighters were based on Camp
 Johnson Road in downtown Monrovia just six blocks from President Taylor's office
 in the Executive Mansion. Mutual suspicions and misperceptions by these men and
 their former fighters resulted in widespread unrest on four occasions between Feb-
 ruary and August. Johnson's followers, almost all members of the Krahn minority,
 frequently harassed motorists and pedestrians passing through their neighborhood
 at night. When the security forces were sent to deal with these problems, undisci-
 plined and heavily armed former combatants within the SSS and the Liberian Na-
 tional Police (LNP) Special Task Force used excessive force, thereby further provok-
 
 
 ing the Krahn. Altogether, at least four persons were killed in these clashes. In each
 case ECOMOG stepped in to restore order.
 On September 18, security forces in the capital conducted a military assault,
 codenamed Operation Camp Johnson Road, against Johnson's base. Hundreds of
 SSS officers and members of the police Special Task Force, joined by scores of irreg-
 ular former combatants of Taylor's former faction, employed automatic weapons,
 rocket-propelled grenades, and mortars. Much of the shooting occurred at nighttime
 and was indiscriminate. Credible reports indicate that as many as 300 persons,
 most of them Krahns, many of them women and children, were killed in a 17-hour
 battle, and in subsequent house-to-house searches and summary executions by gov-
 ernment forces. On the night of September 18, ECOMOG peacekeepers reported wit-
 nessing a double execution of unidentified males on the eastern outskirts of Monro-
 via. Krahn leader Roosevelt Johnson survived the initial attack and sought refuge
 in a Western embassy on September 19; police opened fire on Johnson and seven
 supporters in the entryway of the embassy, killing two members of Johnson's party,
 and wounding other members of his party as well as two embassy employees. One
 hour later and three blocks away, several international NGO workers witnessed an
 execution of an unidentified male by security force members. Five senior officers and
 several junior officers of the Krahn-dominated Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) were
 interrogated and tortured on September 21 at a military stockade in central Monro-
 via. They were then taken to a miitary base outside the capital and executed. The
 Government falsely claimed that the men had been caught in crossfire during the
 September 19 fighting. Eleven persons reportedly were tortured before being killed
 on October 1 (see Section 1.c.). Following these events, about 9,000 persons, most
 members of the Krahn ethnic group, fled from the country to neighboring Cote
 d'Ivoire. Although the Government agreed to the demands of the international com-
 munity for a United Nations investigation of these events, no inquiry had begun by
 year's end.
 Five SSS officers were charged in January with the November 1997 murder of op-
 position political leader Samuel Saye Dokie and three family members. The LNP
 had detained the Dokies at a, police checkpoint in Gbarnga on November 28, 1997.
 On the following day, the five accused officers forcibly removed the Dokies from po-
 lice custody. The Dokies' mutilated, burned bodies were discovered 3 days later. The
 director of the SSS publicly admitted that he had ordered the Dokies' arrest, but
 he disavowed participation in or knowledge of the murders. Although Dokie had
 been a renegade from Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front, the President prom-
 ised to bring the Dokies' murderers to justice. When the trial of the five SSS officers
 began on February 25, the prosecutor dropped charges against three of the five men,
 who agreed to turn state's evidence against the other two. The Government also
 issued arrest warrants for four other individuals, including the SSS regional com-
 mander, who allegedly fled to Cote d'Ivoire. There were numerous procedural irreg-
 ularities in the ensuing trial. On April 8, the jury unanimously found the two ac-
 cused men not guilty. The Government made no serious attempt to locate or extra-
 dite the other suspects in the case.
 Ritualistic killings, in which body parts used in traditional rituals are removed
 from the victim, continued to occur (see Sections 2.c. and 3). The number of such
 killings is difficult to ascertain, since police often describe deaths as accidents even
 when body parts have been removed. Deaths that appear to be natural or accidental
 sometimes are rumored to be the work of ritualistic killers.
 b. Disappearance.-On the night of June 28, nine members of the SSS allegedly
 abducted Nowai Flomo from her residence near Monrovia. The 37-year-old market
 woman, whose sister is an SSS officer, allegedly engaged in a heated discussion with
 her abductors before being taken from the house. After several persons claimed to
 have witnessed Flomo's ritual murder, a coalition of women's groups threatened a
 massive protest march to demand the arrest of SSS officer David Daniel Daniel was
 arrested on July 7, but was released 3 weeks later for lack of evidence. Daniel was
 arrested again on August 27 and detained in connection with Flomo's disappear-
 ance, but was not brought to trial.
 On June 6, six former fighters of the ULIMO-Krahn faction allegedly disappeared
 at Roberts International Airport while waiting for a flight to Banjul, The Gambia.
 Widespread reports that they had been tortured and killed by government security
 forces proved to be incorrect. There were in fact only five men, not six, and they
 subsequently turned up in Banjul, where they denied having been detained.
 Scores of victims of Operation Camp Johnson Road and persons subsequently
 killed during house-to-house searches were buried secretly by the security forces,
 leaving their next of kin in doubt as to their whereabouts.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other degrading treatment; however, govern-
 
 
 ment security forces tortured, beat and otherwise abused or-humiliated citizens. A
 local human rights organization claimed that security personnel often use torture
 in interrogating those they suspect of criminal activity. There were also reports that
 as many as 11 officers of the armed forces detained at the Barclay Training Center,
 among 27 persons detained pending trial on treason charges, were tortured on Sep-
 tember 21 before being taken to another location and killed (see Section l.a.). Other
 evidence also indicated that government claims that they were killed in a gun battle
 were disingenuous. There were numerous credible reports that security forces sub-
 jected citizens to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. On several occasions dur-
 ing the year, security forces publicly disrobed, flogged, and humiliated perceived op-
 ponents of the administration. In April the Director of Police ordered the flogging
 of a member-designate of the Liberia Human Rights Commission for an alleged traf-
 fic violation. J. Kormah Bryemah sustained multiple contusions from the flogging.
 President Taylor appointed a commission to investigate the matter, but refused to
 publicize its findings, claiming that he had ordered the probe for his personal infor-
 mation. The Senate subsequently declined to confirm Bryemah's appointment to the
 commission.
 The Government often dispatched security force units to rural areas without pay-
 ing or provisioning them. There were many incidents in which members of the secu-
 rity services and the armed forces serving in rural parts of the country harassed
 and extorted-money and goods from civilians. There were many credible reports that
 security forces harassed returning refugees, displaced persons, and refugees from Si-
 erra Leone, especially in the border areas (see Section 2.d.).
 In July, August, and October, while dismantling several-thousand market stalls
 used by small traders, police manhandled numerous marketers and confiscated
 thousands of dollars worth of money and goods. The campaign, which was carried
 out in the name of urban beautification, was suspended in September but resumed
 in December.
 Clan chieftains continued to use the traditional practice of trial-by-ordeal to re-
 solve criminal cases in rural areas. Although the Supreme Court ruled that trial-
 by-ordeal--commonly, the placement of a burning metal object on a suspect's body
 to determine whether he or she is telling the truth-is unconstitutional, the Min-
 istry of Internal Affairs continued tacitly to condone the practice in an unknown
 number of cases in 1998. In April four young men in Nimba County who were ac-
 cused of stealing gin distillery equipment were admitted to a local clinic with third
 degree burns on the bottoms of their feet. The injuries were the result of trial-by-
 ordeal carried out by a clan chief on the orders of the local army commander. A law-
 suit brought in 1994 for injuries resulting from trial-by-ordeal still was pending be-
 fore the Supreme Court at year's end.
 Armed supporters of Roosevelt Johnson, the last of the warlords who had opposed
 Taylor in the civil war, also regularly harassed citizens and subjected them to extor-
 tion, according to numerous reports. However, Johnson and many of his supporters
 left the country after the Government's attack on them in September (see Section
 l.a.).
 Prison conditions were harsh, and in some cases life threatening. The Government
 did not provide prisoners with adequate food or medical care. Cells at Monrovia
 Central Prison occasionally were overcrowded with prisoners awaiting trial. The
 Deputy Minister of Justice for Corrections welcomed and supported initiatives by
 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the Catholic Justice and
 Peace Commission, and other NGO's to make improvements to prison facilities in
 Monrovia and Kakata. President Taylor visited Monrovia's Central Prison in Decem-
 ber and subsequently ordered the release of some prisoners being held without
 charge.
 Women, who constituted about 5 percent of the prison population, were held in
 separate cells. A jailer raped a female inmate in August in Saniquellie, Nimba
 County. A local magistrate ordered the severe flogging of the jailer. There were no
 separate facilities for juvenile offenders.
 Human rights groups were granted frequent access to prisoners in Monrovia, and
 these groups often obtained needed medical treatment for prisoners. In a number
 of cases, human rights groups and interested individuals achieved the release of
 prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention; however, security forces continued at times to arrest and detain
 persons arbitrarily. The Constitution provides for the rights of the accused, includ-
 ing warrants for arrests, and the right of detainees either to be charged or released
 within 48 hours. Although the Government generally adheres to these standards,
 warrants were not always based on sufficient evidence, and detainees, especially
 
 
 those without the means to hire a lawyer, often were held for more than 48 hours
 without charge.
 Lengthy pretrial detention is also a serious problem. Two armed robbery suspects
 from Rivercess were detained for over 2 months before they were charged. Eighteen
 persons arrested in Vai Town in October 1997 and charged with a single murder
 remained in pretrial detention for over a year. The police nave only limited logistics
 and forensic capabilities, and cannot adequately investigate many crimes, including
 murder cases. When the courts release known criminals for lack of evidence, police
 officers often rearrest them on specious charges.
 In September, following Operation Camp Johnson Road, the Government arrested
 some members of the armed forces and 19 civilians, including some senior Krahn
 leaders, on charges that included treason and sedition in some cases. The Govern-
 ment dropped charges against 5 of the civilian suspects in return for their testimony
 as state witnesses; the trial of the remaining 14 civilian detainees was just begin-
 ning at year's end. The military personnel arrested at the same time remained in
 detention, uncharged, at year's end.
 The Government did not use forced exile, but the security forces frequently har-
 assed and threatened opposition figures to the point that a number of them de-
 parted the country due to fear for their personal safety or that of their families. Sev-
 eral times during the year, President Taylor publicly alleged that some of these op-
 position figures had gone abroad to conspire in the overthrow of his Government.
 The effect of such statements was to keep numerous prominent opposition figures
 and former warlords out of the country indefinitely.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Although the Constitution provides for an inde-
 pendent judiciary, judges always have been subject to political, social, familial, and
 financial pressures. Corruption and lack of professionalism remained a recurrent
 problem.
 The judiciary is divided into four levels, with the Supreme Court at the apex. All
 levels of the court system in Monrovia, including' the Supreme Court, functioned,
 though erratically. A new juvenile court, the first in the country's history, was es-
 tablished in 1997, but it tried no cases during the year. A criminal court established
 late in 1997 specifically to handle armed robbery cases heard only one case during
 1998. Outside Monrovia the judiciary did not function in most areas due to an acute
 lack of trained personnel, infrastructure, and resources. In some parts of the coun-
 try, refugees returning from abroad found squatters occupying their houses, but had
 no legal recourse to evict them. Several localities reverted to traditional forms of
 justice administered by clan chieftains (see Section 1.c.).
 Under the Constitution, defendants have due process rights that conform to inter-
 nationally accepted standards. However, in practice these rights are not always ob-
 served. Courts regularly received kickbacks on damages awarded in civil cases. De-
 fense attorneys often suggested that their clients pay a gratuity to appease judges,
 prosecutors, and police officers, and ensure a favorable ruling.
 In August the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court summarily sentenced a Deputy
 Minister of Information to 5 days in the central prison for criminal contempt after
 he said in a radio interview that he felt that the judiciary was "rotten." In December
 the President called for reform of the judiciary and dismissed a number of mag-
 istrates and justices of the peace accused of incompetence or malfeasance.
 f. Arbitray Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the right of privacy and the sanctity of the home; however,
 authorities regularly infringed on these rights. The Constitution provides that police
 must obtain a warrant, or have a reasonable belief that a crime is in progress, or
 is about to be committed, before entering a private dwelling. In practice, police and
 SSS officers frequently entered private homes and churches without a warrant to
 carry out arrests and investigations. For example, in April armed SSS officers en-
 tered the home of a former minister of commerce with the stated purpose of killing
 him. The former minister was not at home, but the SSS officers nonetheless man-
 handled his female friend. Police searched scores of homes without warrants follow-
 ing Operation Camp Johnson Road, in several cases triggering gun battles with the
 Krahn inhabitants.
 The security forces regularly harassed and threatened opposition figures and their
 families by surveilling, and in some cases, entering their homes, usually at night.
 Several journalists and human rights activists slept in the homes of friends or rel-
 atives for months at a time due to fear that the security forces might follow through
 with their threats. These incidents of harassment increased significantly in the im-
 mediate aftermath of Operation Camp Johnson Road. In rural areas, armed security
 forces illegally entered homes, most often to steal food, money, or other valuables
 (see Section 1.c.). This problem was especially prevalent in remote parts of Lofa
 County during the first half of the year.
 
 
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press; however, the Government restricted this right in practice. The
 Government temporarily closed newspapers and radio stations, and harassed and
 threatened journalists, many of whom practiced self-censorship.
 The Government took several steps in the beginning of the year that appeared
 to be part of a concerted effort to limit freedom of the press. However, in each case
 the Government subsequently reversed course. For example, on March 20, the Min-
 istry of Information announced new media guidelines that, if enforced, would have
 driven most private newspapers and radio stations out of business. The guidelines
 established liquidity requirements, minimum education and experience standards
 for editors, and a minimum daily circulation level that would have forced cash-
 strapped newspapers to double their output. The Press Union of Liberia challenged
 the guidelines as unconstitutional, because they restricted freedom of expression.
 After discussing the issue with the press union, the Ministry agreed to revise the
 guidelines to the satisfaction of the private media. In May, journalists raised con-
 cern about the fact that Decree 88-A, promulgated by President Samuel Doe in the
 1980's, remained in force and could be invoked by the Government to restrict press
 freedom. The Justice and Peace Commission researched the matter and found that
 an interim legislature had repealed the decree in August 1993. However, to allay
 lingering concern, President Taylor formally repealed the decree in July.
 Despite the Government's reversal in these areas, it took a number of actions that
 restricted press freedom. On January 5, the Ministry of Information ordered
 Monrovia's only printing press to cease publication of Heritage, a twice-weekly pri-
 vate newspaper. The Ministry claimed that a Heritage editorial was inflammatory.
 The opinion piece in question innocuously chided the Government for apparent in-
 gratitude towards ECOMOG, the Nigerian-led peacekeeping force. The Government
 permitted the newspaper to resume publication after the managing editor formally
 apologized to the Ministry.
 On January 22, the head of the police Special Task Force severely flogged Hassan
 Bility, the managing editor of The National, a twice-weekly private newspaper,
 while escorting him to police headquarters for questioning. President Taylor prom-
 ised to take disciplinary action against the police officer concerned, but no action
 was taken by year's end.
 Security forces periodically threatened private print media editors and journalists
 throughout the year. In April a group of police officers used a charge of reckless
 driving as a pretext to harass the managing editor of a private daily. In May secu-
 rity officers threatened to burn alive the staff of another private daily, and in Au-
 gust they warned the same staff, "neither God nor Satan can save you this time."
 Several leading private journalists did not sleep in their own homes for extended
 periods because of frequent nighttime visits andverbal threats by security officers.
 The harassment of private journalists intensified greatly following Operation Camp
 Johnson Road, resulting in a high degree of self-censorship, particularly with regard
 to security issues.
 Seven private newspapers were published regularly in the country. Two were dai-
 lies and five appeared once or twice weekly. Some of them carried articles that were
 critical of the Government. However, their editors admitted to practicing self-censor-
 ship by withholding news reports that reflected unfavorably on-and commentary
 that was highly critical of-the President, the security services, and official corrup-
 tion.
 Due to limited literacy and the relatively high costs of newspapers and television,
 radio remained the most important medium of mass communication. Six private FM
 radio stations located in the capital broadcast to the greater Monrovia area and in
 some cases beyond. The Monrovia Communications Network, affiliated with Presi-
 dent Taylor's National Patriotic Party and reportedly financed by the President per-
 sonally, operated one of these stations, and also maintained a short-wave station
 that broadcasts to the entire country from the town of Totota, near the center of
 the country. Its programming was not critical of the executive branch of the Govern-
 ment. Of the five other privately owned domestic FM radio stations, two were owned
 by nationals of the country, one was operated by the Catholic archdiocese, one was
 an evangelical station, and one was foreign owned. The Catholic Church also oper-
 ated a weak short-wave transmitter. Programming on these private stations, largely
 domestically produced, was occasionally critical of the Government. Telephone talk
 shows were popular. In September police arrested a prominent businesswoman and
 questioned her about comments she made on a telephone talk show. In her remarks,
 she suggested that the Government apologize to a foreign government for a shooting
 incident in which security forces trespassed on the premises of that government's
 embassy and wounded two members of the embassy's staff (see Section L.a.).
 
 
 On January 7, the Government ordered the closure of Star Radio, a private sta-
 tion operated by a Swiss NGO. It later relented and allowed the station to continue
 broadcasting. However, in October the Government prohibited Star Radio from post-
 ing its news bulletins on the Internet and broadcasting on short wave. The Govern-
 ment reversed its position shortly thereafter and permitted the station to resume
 use of the Internet, but at year's end it continued to prohibit its use of short-wave
 frequencies. The Government's limitation of Star Radio to FM broadcasts prevented
 its broadcasts from reaching audiences outside the immediate Monrovia area.
 Two television stations operated in the country; both were privately owned. They
 broadcast to an apparently small number of viewers in the greater Monrovia area.
 One was very irregular due to technical difficulties. The other, financed by Presi-
 dent Taylor, broadcast for a couple of hours every evening, usually showing coverage
 of government events or old movies. News reports and editorials on the more inde-
 pendent station were seldom critical of the Government, but were not known to
 have been restricted by the Government. No international cable or satellite tele-
 vision services were available. There were no known restrictions on personal sat-
 ellite receivers.
 Two private Internet service providers-the country's first-began operations dur-
 ing the year. Several government officials publicly criticized citizens who dissemi-
 nated damaging information and criticism of the Government to Liberians living
 abroad. However, there have been no known attempts to disrupt or otherwise limit
 access to the Internet. The Government maintained its own website, which it used
 to counter what it considered false allegations propagated on the Internet.
 The Liberian Broadcasting Corporation (LBS) operates one FM station that covers
 the greater Monrovia area and a short-wave station that reaches outside the coun-
 try. News programming is informative and generally balanced, but seldom critical
 of the Government. At least one reporter was suspended during the year for broad-
 casting news considered uncomplimentary to the Government. During the 1997 gen-
 eral and presidential elections, candidates enjoyed equal access to the state-owned
 radio station. LBS also owns a television transmitter, which was inoperative. The
 Ministry of Information publishes a newspaper that generally appears once a week.
 Reports and editorials were strictly progovernment, and occasionally were stridently
 adversarial towards critics of the Government.
 Academic freedom was generally respected at the University of Liberia. In July
 and August, speakers at a 3-week long national conference on the future of the
 country were openly critical of the Taylor administration's first year in office. There
 were no known reprisals.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly, and the Government generally respected this right
 in practice. The Government used objective criteria to approve or disapprove permits
 for public meetings. Approvals for marches and gatherings were sometimes contin-
 gent upon rerouting or changes in venue. Several permits were denied during 1998
 on security grounds. These actions did not appear to be discriminatory towards any
 particular group. In September the Justice Minister denied a permit for a dem-
 onstration at a foreign embassy that had been instigated by President Taylor, fol-
 lowing the embassy's decision to provide temporary refuge to Roosevelt Johnson.
 The Constitution provides for the right of association and the Government gen-
 erally respects this right in practice. Registration requirements can be onerous, but
 do not appear to be discriminatory towards any specific group.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution recognizes freedom of religion as a fun-
 damental right, and the Government generally respects this right in practice. There
 is no established state religion. Although Islam is gaining adherents, as much as
 40 percent of the population profess to be Christian. A significant portion of the pop-
 ulation follows traditional animism or blends traditional religions with Christianity
 or Islam. Little reliable information appears to be readily available about traditions
 associated with ritual killings (see Section L.a.).
 Although the law prohibits religious discrimination, Islamic leaders complained of
 societal discrimination against Muslims (see Section 5).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement throughout the
 country as well as the right to leave or enter; however, the Government restricted
 freedom of movement by means of numerous joint security checkpoints where travel-
 ers routinely were subjected to arbitrary searches and petty extortion. Security
 forces also extorted money from returning refugees.
 In June the Government repealed an exit visa requirement for all residents, and
 no longer required foreign visitors to register with the immigration service within
 48 hours of arrival.

 The law includes provisions for granting refugee/asylee status in accordance with
 the provisions of the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and
 its 1967 Protocol. The Government provided first asylum. There was a large influx
 of refugees from neighboring Sierra Leone due to the political violence in that coun-
 try.
 Although no official census has been taken, it is estimated that there are more
 than 120,000 Sierra Leoneans living along the western border of the country. The
 Taylor administration cooperated with the office of the United Nations High Com-
 mission for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in attempting
 to assist these refugees. However, inaccessibility due to poor road conditions and the
 limited capacity of local NGO's severely restricted the amount of relief assistance
 that could be provided. A large number of refugees were moved from the least acces-
 sible camp in Vahun to a newly established camp in Kolahun, which was farther
 from the border and more accessible. Many refugees, among them families and camp
 followers of a Sierra Leonean rebel group, the Revolutionary United Front, re-
 mained in Vahun voluntarily.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for the right to vote in free and fair elections, and citi-
 zens exercised this right in 1997 in elections that international observers deemed
 free and transparent. However, the elections were conducted in an atmosphere of
 intimidation, as most voters believed that the forces loyal to Charles Taylor would
 resume the civil war if Taylor were to lose the election. Since the legislative election
 was held on the basis of proportional representation, Taylor's National Patriotic
 Party won control of the legislature by the same 75 percent majority that Taylor
 received in the popular vote for the presidency. The 1997 legislative and presidential
 elections were held under a special election law in accordance with the terms of the
 Abuja peace process.
 In July the chairman of the Election Commission issued a warning that can-
 didates for public office who engaged in ritualistic killing, in the belief that it would
 enhance their electability, would be disqualified and would face criminal prosecution
 for murder (see Section 1.a.) This appeared to be a response to -a genuine social
 problem rather than an attempt by the Government to create a pretext for restrict-
 ing political competition.
 The Congress did not exercise genuine independence from the executive branch.
 Opposition legislators, who controlled only one-auar of the seats in the House of
 Representatives and in the Senate, were generally more docile than some maverick
 members of the ruling NPP. Although all representatives and senators had been
 elected by proportional representation and did not campaign in their individual dis-
 tricts, most demonstrated a strong sense of responsibility towards their constituents.
 However, Congressional committees failed to develop expertise in their respective
 areas of responsibility. No major legislation was passed into law during the year.
 The State is highy centralized. The President appoints the governors of the 13
 counties. Municipalities and chieftancies elect their own officials. Subnational gov-
 ernments at all levels have no independent revenue base and rely entirely on the
 central Government for funds. Education, health, and public works are provided by
 central Government civil servants. Local officials serve mainy as lobbyists to the
 central Government.
 Municipal and chieftaincy elections were to have been held in May. Due to dis-
 organization, poor planning, and financial mismanagement, polls were held in just
 one county, where a by-election was required to fill a vacant senate seat. The elec-
 tion commission spent $480,000 on the Lofa County election, in which only 40,000
 citizens cast ballots. Disgruntled poll workers who claimed that they did not get
 paid held a member of the Election Commission hostage for several weeks to drama-
 tize their demands. Polling in the country's 12 other counties was at first put off
 until October, and then postponed until the spring of 1999.
 There are no restrictions on the participation of women in politics, but they never-
 theless remained underrepresented in government. The sole female candidate in the
 1997 presidential election finished a distant second behind President Taylor. The
 overall numbers of women in high-ranking positions in the Taylor administration
 and in the various political parties are low. Two of the 20 cabinet positions are held
 by women, a woman serves as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and a woman
 chairs the National Reconciliation Commission.
 Muslims also tend to be underrepresented in government; oniy one cabinet min-
 ister is a Muslim.
 No ethnic or regional group was conspicuously overrepresentd in the Govern-
 ment. President Taylor has described himself as one-third Americo-Liberian, two-
 
 
 239
 
 thirds indigenous. During the year, he appeared to rely on Americo-Liberian support
 less than he did in previous years. Personal loyalty to President Taylor appeared
 increasingly important in the allocation of high public office.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Until mid-September, the Taylor administration permitted domestic and inter-
 national human rights groups to operate largely without interference, but members
 of the security forces frequently harassed individual democracy and human rights
 activists. Although the Government routinely criticized these actions, and pledged
 to investigate them and punish the perpetrators, it did not follow through on these
 pledges. Harassment increased significantly during the last 3 months of the year as
 domestic human rights groups and international NGO workers attempted to gather
 data on the number of persons who were killed, wounded, and remain missing as
 a result of Operation Camp Johnson Road.
 Domestic human rights organizations were underfunded, understaffed, and their
 personnel lacked adequate training. There are two coalitions of human rights
 groups: the National Human Rights Center of Liberia has 12 member organizations,
 while four other groups joined together to form the Liberia Federation of Human
 Rights Organizations. Both of these organizations sought to further public discus-
 sion of human rights problems.
 Some of the human rights groups paid regular visits to detainees at police head-
 quarters and prisoners at the central prison. Several domestic human rights organi-
 zations have established branches outside of the capital and perform similar mon-
 itoring functions there. There was no discernible pattern of government interference
 with these activities.
 The Government created a Human Rights Commission in 1997, but it caused con-
 siderable controversy by limiting the commission's investigatory power to future
 abuses only, restricting its ability to compel testimony or gather evidence, and deny-
 ing it budgetary support. Four members were named to the commission in 1997.
 en te Senate finally held a conation hearing in July, it rejected two of these
 four individuals (see Section 1.c.). However, the Senate passed a bill that strength-
 ened the commission by, among other things, giving it the right to subpoena wit-
 nesses. The President failed to nominate persons to fill the three vacancies on the
 commission, and it remained inactive for all of 1998.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on ethnic background, race, sex,
 creed, place of origin, or political opinion, but discrimination exists. There are no
 laws against gender discrimination, ethnic discrimination, or female genital mutila-
 tion (FGM). Differences involving ethnic groups, notably the Krahn group, continued
 to contribute to serious political violence and abuses.
 Womeu-Domestic violence against women was extensive but never was ad-
 dressed seriously as an issue by the Government, the courts, or the media. Several
 NGO's in Monrovia and Buchanan continued programs to treat abused women and
 girls and increase awareness of their human rights.
 The status of women varies by region, ethnic group, and religion. Before the out-
 break of the civil war, women held one-fourth of the professional and technical jobs
 in Monrovia. On the whole, women have not recovered from the setbacks imposed
 by the civil war, when most schools were closed and they could not carry out their
 traditional roles in the production, allocation, and sale of food.
 In urban areas, women can inherit land and property. In rural areas, where tradi-
 tional practices are stronger, a woman normally is considered the property of her
 husband and his clan and usually is not entited to ierit from her husband or re-
 tain custody of her children if her husband dies. There continued to be few pro-
 grams to help former combatants reintegrate into society, and there were none spe-
 cifically to benefit former female combatants. However, several women's organiza-
 tions advanced family welfare issues, helped promote political reconciliation, and as-
 sisted in rehabilitating both former female combatants and women who were victims
 of the civil war.
 Throughout the year, professional women's groups-including lawyers, marketers,
 and businesswomen-remained vocal about their concerns. Government officials
 often responded negatively to public criticism. There were credible reports of harass-
 ment nd apossible surveillance of outspoken critics. Security officers forcibly brought
 a prominent women's rights activist to police headquarters for questioning and de-
 tamed her for several hours a   she revealed to the media that there were wit-
 nesses to the killing and secret burial of Nawai Flomo (see Section wb.). The activist
 
 
 eventually was- set free, but only after thousands of women threatened to march on
 police headquarters to demand her release.
 Children.-Due to the poor condition of government schools, most children who at-
 tended school went to private institutions. Since many private schools had to be re-
 furbished due to wartime damage, school fees were increased greatly, thereby mak-
 ing education unattainable for many school-age children. In both public and private
 schools, children often were asked to provide their own books, pencils, and paper.
 No data were known to be available on either school enrollment or government ex-
 penditure on education.
 Young persons were victimized seriously during the civil war. An estimated
 50,000 children were killed; many more were wounded, orphaned, or abandoned.
 Nearly all youths witnessed terrible atrocities and some committed atrocities them-
 selves. Twenty-one percent (4,306) of the combatants who disarmed under the provi-
 sions of the Abuja Peace Accords were child soldiers under the age of 17. Many
 youths remain traumatized and some still are addicted to drugs. The number of
 street children in Monrovia and the number of abandoned infants increased signifi-
 cantly following disarmament. NGO's and UNICEF continued retraining and reha-
 bilitation programs for a limited number of former child fighters. A new juvenile
 court was established in Monrovia in 1997, but it lacked the resources and person-
 nel to function. Children continued to be incarcerated with adults, and there were
 long delays in deciding cases involving minors.
 Female genital mutilation is widely condemned by international health experts as
 damaging to both physical and psychological health. FGM traditionally has been
 performed on young girls by northern, western, and central tribes, particularly in
 rural areas among traditional societies. Prior to the onset of the civil war in 1989,
 approximately 50 percent of women in rural areas between the ages of 8 and 18
 were subjected to FGM. In some instances, female health professionals in the tribes
 participated in the practice to the extent of providing postoperative care.
 The war totally disrupted traditional village life. Most of the population fled to
 neighboring countries or became displaced within the country. Social structures and
 traditional institutions, such as the secret societies that often performed FGM as
 an initiation rite, also were undermined by the war. While many experts believe the
 incidence of FGM had dropped to as low as 10 percent by the end of the war, tradi-
 tional societies are reestablishing themselves throughout the country, and a rise in
 the incidence of FGM is expected. The most extreme form of FGM, infibulation, is
 not practiced. The Government has taken no action against FGM.
 People With Disabilities.-As a result of the civil war, there is a large number of
 persons with permanent injuries in addition to those disabled by accident or illness.
 It is illegal to discriminate against the disabled, but in practice they do not enjoy
 equal access to public buildings. There are no laws mandating accessibility to public
 buildings or services.
 Religious Minorities.-The law prohibits religious discrimination. However, Libe-
 rian secular culture gives preference to Christianity in civic ceremonies and observ-
 ances, and discrimination spills over into areas of individual opportunity and em-
 ployment. Although there are some Muslims in senior government positions, many
 Muslims believe that they are bypassed for highly desirable government jobs.
 Many Muslim business proprietors believe that the Taylor Government's decision
 to enforce an old statute prohibiting business on Sunday discriminated against
 them.
 Between April and June, unknown persons set fire to six mosques in Lofa, Bong,
 and Nimba counties; these mosque burnings apparently were part of a conflict be-
 tween the predominantly Muslim Mandingo ethnic group and other non-Muslim eth-
 nic groups. President Taylor criticized the arson attacks, blamed them on religious
 hatred, and promised to investigate. Although no arrests were made, there were no
 further arson incidents during the year.
 In December there was a small number of violent clashes between Muslim and
 Christian youth groups in Monrovia during a Christian evangelical crusade.
 National/Racial [Ethnic Minorities.-Although the Constitution bans ethnic dis-
 crimination, it also provides that only "persons who are Negroes or of Negro de-
 scent" may be citizens or own land. Many persons of Asian descent who were born
 or lived most of their lives in Liberia are denied full rights as a result of this racial
 distinction. It appeared that the issue of national and ethnic origin would be a
 major topic on the agenda of the July-August National Conference on the Future
 of Liberia. However, in his remarks at the opening of the conference, however,
 President Taylor declared that the issue would be addressed in a national referen-
 dum and should not be discussed by delegates.
 The country, although small, is ethnically diverse. The population of about 3 mil-
 lion is made up of 16 indigenous ethnic groups as well as the Americo-Liberian mi-
 
 
 nority-descendents of freed African slaves from the United States and the Carib-
 bean-which until 1980 dominated the Government and the public sector through
 the True Whig Party. The indigenous ethnic groups generally speak distinct primary
 languages and are concentrated regionally. No ethnic group constitutes a majority
 of the population.
 A very large but undetermined number of innocent citizens who happened to be
 of the Kraln ethnic group were victimized during house-to-house searches following
 Operation Camp Johnson Road. Government security forces also turned away from
 hospitals virtually every Krahn who sought treatment for wounds received during
 the fighting.
 Many members of the predominantly Muslim Mandingo minority encountered
 hostility when they sought to return, after the end of the civil war, to their villages
 in Lofa, Bong, andNimba canties. Many Mandingos were unable to reoccupy their
 own homes, which had been taken over by squatters. Arsonists burned six mosques
 in the region between April and June, in what appeared to be a pattern of violence
 against the Mandingos by members of rival ethnic groups. Members of the Lorma,
 Gio, and Mano minorities generally held all Mandingos responsible for atrocities
 committed by the ULIMO-Mandingo faction during the civil war. The lack of com-
 petent security forces and a fully functioning judiciary in these areas prevented
 many Mandingos from seeking redress.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution states that workers, except mem-
 bers of the military and police, have the right to associate in trade unions. The Con-
 stitution also states that unions are prohibited from partisan political activity. Gov-
 ernment interference in union activities, especially union elections and leaderships
 struggles, was common both before and during the civil war.
 Although most economic activity was interrupted by the war, unions proliferated.
 Thirty-two functioning unions were organized loosely under two umbrella groups--
 the Federation of Liberian Trade Unions and the Congress of Liberian Trade
 Unions--with the common objective of protecting the rights of their 60,000 mem-
 bers, who largely were unemployed. The actual power that the unions exercised was
 extremely limited, since the country's work force is largely illiterate and the labor
 laws tend to favor management.
 The Constitution is slent on the right to strike, but labor laws protect this right.
 A decree passed by the People's Redemption Council in 1984 outlawed strikes, but
 it was not enforced during the year. Due to the destruction of the economy and the
 estimated 85 percent unemployment rate, strikes were infrequent. However, on
 April 12, the Firestone Rubber Plantation Agricultural Workers' Union went on
 strike over a proposed wage increase. The strike was settled 7 weeks later.
 The Taylor Government strictly enforced the union registration requirements that
 had fallen into disuse during the war. Its failure to make civil service salary pay-
 ments on time produced conflicts in sev ergoenment departments and agencies.
 Labor unions traditionally have been aiated with international labor groups
 such as the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 The United States suspended Liberia's status as a beneficiary under the General-
 ized System of Preference (GSP). The program was suspended in 1990 as a result
 of the Doe government's failure to provide internationally recognized workers'
 rights.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Colctively.-With the important exception
 of civil servants, workers (including employees of public corporations and autono-
 moh agencies) have the right to organize and bargain collectively. In the past,
 agreements were negotiated freely between workers and their employers without
 government interference. These rights were largely moot becausthe o lack of eco-
 nomic enterprise.
 There were no export processing zones. All those previously existing were do-
 stroyed during the civil war.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor, but even before the civil war this prohibition was widely ignored in rural
 areas where farmers were pressured into providing free labor on "community
 projects" that often benefited only local leaders. In many p arts of the country, this
 practice continued. Two domestic NGO's reported cases of forced labor in the south-
 east.
 The Constitution prohibits forced and bonded labor by children. However, in Jan-
 uary an international NGO reported from Sinoe County in the southeast that former
 combatants "adopted" former child soldiers and used them for forced labor, pri-
 marily in farming activities. The Government appointed a commission, consisting
 largely of security personnel, which reported after a cursory investigation in the
 
 
 242
 southeast that it had discovered no evidence of the practice. A leading local NGO
 sent a separate mission, which it said confirmed that this practice does exist.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 prohibits the employment of children under the age of 16 during school hours in the
 wage sector, but enforcement traditionally has been lax. Throughout rural areas,
 but particularly where there were no schools, small children continued to assist
 their parents as vendors in local markets or on the streets, to take care of younger
 brothers and sisters, and to work on family subsistence farms.
 The Constitution prohibits forced and bonded labor by children; however, there
 were reports of its use (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptabl Conditions of Work.-The Labor Law provides for a minimum wage,
 paid leave, severance benefits, and safety standards, but enforcement was targeted
 solely against profitable firms that generally observed these standards. The Min-
 istry of Labor assessed heavy fines against these firms in order to generate revenue.
 Due to the country's continued economic problems, most citizens were forced to ac-
 cept any work they could find regardless of wages or working conditions.
 The 1977 Labor Law requires a minimum wage of approximately $0.25 per hour
 not exceeding 8 hours per day, excluding benefits, for unskilled laborers. Agricul-
 tural workers are paid $1.50 for an 8-hour day, excluding benefits. Skilled labor has
 no minimum fixed wage, but industrial workers usually received three or four times
 the wage paid to agricultural workers. The much-sought-after minimum wage jobs
 provided a decent standard of living for a worker and family. However, there were
 very few such jobs. Families dependent on minimum wage incomes also engage in
 subsistence farming, small-scale marketing, petty extortion, and begging.
 The Ministry of Labor did not have the resources to monitor compliance with the
 labor laws.
 The Labor Law provides for a 48-hour, 6-day regular workweek with a 30-minute
 rest period per 5 hours of work. The 6-day workweek may extend to 56 hours for
 service occupations and to 72 hours for miners, with overtime pay beyond 48 hours.
 Prior to 1990, there also were government-established health and safety standards,
 enforced in theory by the Ministry of Labor. During the war, these regulations were
 not enforced. Even under the Labor Law, workers did not have a specific right to
 remove themselves from dangerous situations without risking loss of employment.
