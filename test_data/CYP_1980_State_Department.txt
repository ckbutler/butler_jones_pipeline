 CYPRUS
 Human rights issues in Cyprus reflect a long history of
 troubles between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot com-
 munities. The two communities frequently take opposing views
 on questions of human rights. The continuing presence of
 Turkish military forces in northern Cyprus is the major area
 of disagreement. The Government of Cyprus considers the
 Turkish military an occupying force whose presence constitutes
 a continuing violation of international law. Turkish Cypriots
 argue that until a comprehensive settlement is achieved, the
 Turkish military presence is required to guarantee the security
 of the :urkish Cypriot community.
 Another serious issue is the problem of displaced persons
 arising from the 1974 de facto division of the island. The
 Government of Cyprus maintains that all displaced persons must
 be permitted to return to their homes in accordance with
 United Nations resolutions. The Turkish Cypriot leadership,
 however, argues that return of displaced persons must be im-
 plemented in a way that takes account of practical difficulties
 and the requirements of a bicommunal state. The question of
 persons who are missing as a result of violent events, parti-
 cularly as a result of the hostilities of 1974, also remains
 unresolved.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Article I of the constitution prohibits torture. Torture is not
 permitted or practiced by the Cyprus government, the Turkish
 Cypriot administration, or Turkish forces in northern Cyprus.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punish-
 ment is guaranteed by law in both communities and has been
 respected in practice within each community during the past
 year. There are no summary executions.
 Adequate health care is provided in prison and detention fa-
 cilities. Diet is considered adequate. In detention, family
 members may visit at any interval not deemed to impede an in-
 vestigation. Once sentenced, prisoners may be visited by
 family members once a month or more frequently when humani-
 tarian needs exist. Attorneys may visit prisoners freely.
 Differing classes of imprisonment do not exist except in cases
 requiring medical treatment and for first offenders awaiting
 trial.
 c. Disappearances
 There are no current reports of persons being abducted,
 secretly arrested or held in clandestine detention. However,
 as a result.of the 1963-74 intercommunal troubles and the
 events of 1974, the issue of missing persons remains a source
 of dispute between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot com-
 munities.
 
 
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice by both Greek Cypriot and
 Turkish Cypriot authorities. The right of habeas corpus is
 observed. Preventive detention exists neither in law nor in
 practice. No individual may be held for more than three days
 for investigation of a crime without referral to a court for
 extension of the period of detention. Most periods of in-
 vestigative detention do not exceed eight or ten days before
 formal charges are filed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In both communities, fair public trial is guaranteed and
 provided in practice. Because Cyprus was a British colony,
 it incorporated many of the features of the British judicial
 system. The judiciary is independent of executive or mili-
 tary control. Jury trials are almost unknown, and, although
 a request for a jury trial usually is granted, cases generally
 are tried before a judge or a panel of judges. All defendants
 are entitled to counsel and counsel has unrestricted private
 access to his client. There are no known incidents of harrass-
 ment of defense lawyers. There are no special courts to deal
 with security or political offenses. There are no reports of
 political prisoners. Civilians are not tried by military
 courts.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Inviolability of the home, except with judicial warrant, is
 guaranteed by the Cyprus constitution. A "constitution"
 adopted by the Turkish Cypriots in 1975 has a similar guarantee.
 It is respected in practice.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 The Greek Cypriot economy is free enterprise-oriented with
 only a modicum of government participation or regulation.
 The economy is based on agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and
 tourism. The manufacturing sector at 16.2 percent is the
 largest contributor to the gross domestic product (GDP), which
 in 1979 amounted to $1.72 billion. GDP per capita in the
 government-controlled area in 1979 was $3,300. The economic
 problems faced by the Greek Cypriots are those of moderate
 inflation, sectoral labor shortages and small production units.
 The Turkish Cypriot economy, because it is tied to the Turkish
 economy and uses the Turkish Lira as its currency, has suf-
 fered from the same problems as the Turkish economy-i.e., high
 inflation, low investment, and significant underemployment.
 GDP in 1978 was estimated to have been about $200.7 million.
 On a per capita basis, this amounted to $1,580. However, be-
 cause of exchange rate fluctuations and other factors, the
 statistics available for the Turkish sector may not indicate
 the true disparity between the two communities.  (Calculated
 at the 1978 exchange rate of 1 dollar equals 25.3 TL). In-
 come and wealth are reasonably wall distributed within both
 communities, and extreme disparities between the upper and
 lower classes do not exist in Cyprus. Cypriot society is
 essentially middle class with a small but prominent wealthy
 
 
 756
 class. Government of Cyprus and Turkish Cypriot tax systems
 are progressive. The right of private property is vigorously
 protected by the Government of Cyprus and Turkish Cypriot
 authorities. Adequate housing is available, even for dis-
 placed persons, as is health care. There is a "national
 health scheme" on each side of the island which provides
 free medical care to lower income people and all employees
 of the Government of Cyprus, and employees of the Turkish
 Cypriot authorities. In the Turkish Cypriot-administered
 areas in 1978, there was reportedly one hospital bed for every
 199 persons and one doctor for every 1,280 persons. In
 government-controlled areas, there was one hospital bed for
 every 158 persons and one doctor for every 991 persons.
 Education is free through age 15 and is available throughout
 the country. Illiteracy is virtually unknown in the popula-
 tion under age 55.
 Women have legal status equal to that of men in both com-
 munities. Cyprus is a traditional Mediterranean society in
 which custom rather than law has retarded the participation
 of women in all areas of public life. Changing attitudes,
 urbanization and a modernizing economy have, however, brought
 increasing numbers of women into the work force. Although
 traditional attitudes may impede promotions to a certain
 extent, as in other modern societies, it is reasonable to
 expect that at least some of the women presently employed will
 reach the highest ranks in their professions.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press Religion and Assembly
 All of these basic rights are guaranteed by law and are widely
 and freely practiced. The press is free throughout the en-
 tire island. There are 27 daily and weekly periodicals that
 run the breadth of the political spectrum. The government
 is frequently criticized. There is no censorship and no
 known incident of intimidation of journalists. There is
 freedom of religion for the majority Greek Orthodox and
 Muslim communities, and religious freedom for the Maronite,
 Armenian, other Christian, and Jewish minorities is guar-
 anteed.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Turkish and Greek Cypriots enjoy normal freedom of movement
 within their respective areas. Some of the restrictions im-
 posed by Turkish Cypriot authorities on travel by the Greek
 Cypriot population resident in the north have been relaxed
 in recent years. Greek Cypriots residing in the Turkish-
 Cypriot controlled area still do not have the same freedom
 of movement as do Turkish Cypriots residing in the government-
 controlled area. Travel between the two sectors is extremely
 limited, but some is permitted for humanitarian reasons. The
 Greek Cypriot population (numbering less than 2,000) resident
 in the Turkish Cypriot-administered area continues to decrease
 as a result of gradual transfers to the south. Officials of
 the United Nations force in Cyprus continue to monitor all
 transfer requests in order to ensure that they are voluntary.
 
 
 757
 The right of Turkish Cypriots to travel abroad is complicated
 by the fact that most nations do not recognize passports
 issued by the 'Turkish Federated State of Cyprus (TFSC)" or
 expired passports issued before July 15, 1974 by the Govern-
 ment of Cyprus that have been extended by the "TFSC." The
 government denies individuals access to the government-
 controlled sector if they have entered Cyprus through the
 ports or airports of the Turkish Cypriot-administered area.
 Freedom of movement from the Turkish Cypriot areas to the
 government-controlled area ordinarily is not possible for
 visitors to Cyprus. Turkish Cypriot authorities normally
 restrict entry to their area by individuals of Greek Cypriot
 or Greek ancestry, ostensibly to avoid any possible incident
 of revenge or provocation. The right to travel abroad or
 emigrate is observed. There are, however, some restrictions
 on exit permits from both areas for those of military ser-
 vice age and for those facing legal action. In the government-
 controlled areas, because of labor shortage, some controls
 are also exercised over those seeking employment abroad.
 The Cyprus government is a party to the Geneva Convention and
 the New York Protocol on the Status of Refugees, and it does
 cooperate with the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees in handling refugees from other countries. Given the
 priority of caring for refugees of the events of 1974, Cyprus
 has not offered to accept large numbers of refugees from
 other countries for permanent residence.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Both the Government of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot adminis-
 tration have lively and free Western-style multiparty polit-
 ical systems. Both have a parliament, and suffrage is
 universal. There is active and unrestricted competition for
 support by political parties among all elements of society,
 except for Greek Cypriots living in the north, iho are not
 permitted to vote in Turkish Cypriot elections. The Turkish
 Cypriot authorities have announced plans to enable Greek
 Cypriots and Maronites living in the north to participate
 in local elections and run for local office. Women in both
 north and south participate to a lesser degree in politics
 than do men, although there is no legal impediment. There
 are some women in party structures and women are represented
 at various levels of government. The government has estab-
 lished an interministerial committee on the status of women,
 and sent a representative to the World Conference for Women
 in Copenhagen.
 There is an active trade union movement which exercises the
 right to organize, strike and bargain collectively.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The question of missing persons--resulting from the intercom-
 munal troubles of 1963-74 and the events of 1974--remains an
 issue. Despite a 1977 agreement in principle between the
 leaders of the two communities to establish a committee to
 investigate cases of missing persons, the two sides remain in
 
 
 758
 disagreement on the terms of reference, particularly on the
 role of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
 Decisions on Cyprus-related issues were postponed during 1979
 sessions of the UNHRC and European Human Rights Commission.
