 LITHUANIA
 Lithuania became independent again in 1991 after more than 50
 years of occupation by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
 (U.S.S.R.). :The United States GoVernment, which had refused to
 recognize Lithuania's forcible incorporation into the U.S.S.R.
 in 1940, reestablished formal diplomatic relations with the
 Lithuanian'Government in September, and the Soviet Union, like
 many other'states, recognized Lithuania's independence. In
 September Lithuania joined the United Nations.
 In January and in August, Soviet authorities attempted to
 overthrow the elected Government-of Lithuania. On January 8,
 Communist-organized protests, including a mob attack on the
 Parliament building, led to the resignation of Prime Minister
 Kazimiera Prunskiene. On January 10, Soviet military and
 security forces, claiming that they were protecting Soviet and
 Communist Party property, seized the central publishing house
 and several other premises in Vilnius, the capital city. Three
 days later, they forcibly took over the central television
 tower in Vilnius, killing 13 civilians and injuring scores of
 others. A shadowy National Salvation Committee declared itself
 the legitimate government of Lithuania.
 Despite the results of a referendum on February 9 in which 90
 percent of the voters approved Lithuania's independence, Soviet
 military and security forces continued to harass Lithuania,
 capturing young Lithuanian males for induction into the armed
 forces, seizing additional government buildings, attacking and
 burning Lithuanian border posts, and beating and sometimes
 killing customs and police officials. When the attempted coup
 against Soviet President Gorbachev began on August 19, Soviet
 military troops took over some communications and government
 facilities in yilnius and other cities but returned to their
 barracks when the coup failed. The Lithuanian Government then
 banned the Communist Party and ordered confiscation of its
 property.
 Lithuania is a parliamentary democracy. An elected, unicameral
 legislature, the. Supreme Council, passes laws and selects
 government ministers. The Chairman of the Supreme Council,
 Vytautas Landsbergis, serves as Head of State. The Government,
 consisting of a Council of Ministers headed by a Prime Minister,
 exercises executive authority with parliamentary approval.
 Lithuania adopted a temporary Constitution in 1990, which is an
 amended version of its 1938 constitution. A new constitution
 is being'drafted and will be voted on in a national referendum
 when completed.
 The primary law enforcement organization is the Lithuanian
 police, which replaced the militia~of the Soviet period. Until
 independence, Soviet militia forces, Interior Ministry troops,
 and the Committee for State Security (KGB).were present in
 Lithuania in large numbers and continued to monitor the
 Lithuanian population.
 Lithuania enjoyed a higher standard of living than many of the
 former Soviet republics. Nevertheless, the general Soviet
 economic decline'affected Lithuania, leading to economic
 inefficiencies, shortages, and some rationing. In 1991 the
 Lithuanian Government announced plans to establish a, market
 economy. To this end, the Parliament passed preliminary
 legislation-on privatization, investment, and banking, and the
 Government began a program to raise prices to reflect market
 conditions.

 LITHUANIA
 The human rights situation in the first 8 months of 1991 was
 characterized by severe Soviet repression, including harassment,
 detentions, and killings which occurred against a backdrop of
 rising aspirations of the Lithuanian populace for national
 independence and full sovereignty. Following the failure of
 the attempted coup in the U.S.S.R. in August, the Lithuanian
 authorities fully took over the apparatus of government and put
 into effect a number of laws intended to protect the rights of
 citizens. Freedom of speech, press, assembly, association, and
 religion are provided in law and respected in practice. Concern
 was expressed that the rights of the Polish minority may have
 been infringed by the suspension of local government bodies;
 the Lithuanian authorities say that there is no discrimination
 in law or practice against ethnic Poles or other minorities.
 The foreign press has reported on the rehabilitation of some
 persons alleged to have been involved in crimes against
 humanity during the period of Nazi occupation; the Lithuanian
 Government has asserted that they are rehabilitating only
 persons charged under Soviet law with anti-Soviet crimes, and
 that persons charged with crimes against humanity cannot be
 rehabilitated without a full review of those charges.
 RESPECT FOR HIMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of such killings by Lithuanian
 authorities.
 During their campaign to seize government and other buildings
 from the Lithuanian authorities, Soviet military and security
 forces on January 13 assaulted the central television tower in
 Vilnius, killing 13 Lithuanian civilians and injuring many
 others. Soviet military and civilian authorities refused to
 cooperate with the Lithuanian Procurator General in
 investigating these deaths. The U.S.S.R. Procurator General's
 office issued its own report on the January killings, blaming
 the deaths on "armed Lithuanians" operating in the environs of
 the television tower.
 Later in the year, Soviet security forces attacked Lithuanian
 border posts on several occasions. In one such incident on
 July 31, seven Lithuanian police and customs officials at the
 Medininkai border post were killed. Despite investigative
 efforts by the Lithuanian Procurator's office and promises of
 assistance from Soviet authorities, the perpetrators were not
 identified. During the August coup attempt, a Lithuanian
 Parliament guard was killed by Soviet soldiers who forced their
 way onto the grounds of the Parliament. Two Soviet soldiers
 were seized by Lithuanian security forces at the scene and
 await trial; a third reportedly escaped.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of abductions or disappearances caused by
 Lithuanian officials.
 According to Lithuanian authorities, Soviet military patrols
 before the recognition of Lithuanian independence forcibly
 abducted several Lithuanians of draft age for induction into
 the Soviet armed forces. At that time, many Lithuanian men
 refused to submit to the Soviet military draft and were
 
 
 1169
 LITHUANIA
 encouraged by the Lithuanian Government not to respect Soviet
 draft laws. The Soviet authorities generally refused to
 disclose the whereabouts of these men for some time, but all
 have been released and have returned to Lithuania, as have all
 Lithuanian troops previously serving in the Soviet army.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although such practices were prohibited under Soviet law,
 Lithuanian officials and citizens report many instances in
 which Soviet military and security personnel subjected numerous
 Lithuanians, detained on various groinds, to brutal beatings
 and degrading treatment. In some cases, the victims had to be
 hospitalized and suffered permanent injury. Soviet security
 personnel also reportedly beat Lithuanian customs officers
 during attacks on border posts.
 Lithuanians who were imprisoned by Soviet authorities,
 particularly political prisoners, were harshly treated. They
 commonly suffered physical and psychological abuse and were
 detained under extremely unhealthful conditions. Since
 reestablishing its independence, Lithuania has made serious
 efforts to improve such conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Before independence Soviet military and security authorities in
 Lithuania detained a number of persons without warrant,
 including the Lithuanian Defense Department head, a member of
 Parliament. Lithuanian law forbids arbitrary arrest,
 detention, or exile. There were no reported instances in which
 Lithuanian authorities engaged in such activities. Police may
 detain a person for up to 72 hours based upon reliable evidence
 of criminal activity. At the end of that period, a warrant
 must be approved by a magistrate and a decision made whether or
 not to make a formal arrest. The authorities have a total of
 10 days in which to present a prima facie case. The right to
 an attorney reportedly exists from the moment of detention.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Soviet legal practices prevailed throughout much of the year,
 but Lithuania began to establish its own control over the
 judicial apparatus through appointments and elections of
 procurators and judges without approval from Moscow. Until the
 August coup attempt, this basic division was reflected in the
 existence of two procurators general: one appointed by the
 Lithuanian Parliament, and the other by Soviet authorities.
 A defendant has the right to counsel. While there does not
 seem to be a public defender system as such, a new association
 of private lawyers has been formed. No political trials are
 known to have taken place in 1991.
 Lithuaniani government efforts to rehabilitate persons charged
 with anti-Soviet crimes led to reports that some people alleged
 to have been involved in crimes against humanity during the
 Nazi occupation were also benefiting from this rehabilitation.
 Because of the international attention to this issue, however,
 a special judicial procedure has been established to examine
 when a crime against humanity may have been involved and whether
 or not the person was ever formally charged with this offense.
 Such persons may not be rehabilitated until their cases have
 been fully reviewed.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 Prior to independence, the Soviet security apparatus continued
 to operate openly in Lithuania, employing informers and
 technical means to monitor correspondence and telephone
 conversations in selected cases. These practices ceased with
 the end of Soviet rule. Except in cases of hot pursuit or the
 danger of disappearance of evidence, search warrants are
 required before police may enter private dwellings.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech is widely respected in Lithuania. Despite
 Soviet seizure of the central publishing house and radio and
 television stations in January, the non-Communist Lithuanian
 media were able to find alternate facilities to continue
 publishing and broadcasting, albeit with reduced circulation
 and broadcasting area. Free Lithuanian television programs
 were broadcast from studios and transmission facilities in
 Kaunas, except when Soviet troops briefly seized these sites
 during the August coup attempt. According to the Government,
 there is no exercise of prior restraint over either print or
 broadcast media and no restriction on disclosure, save for
 cases of national security. However, the press itself has
 complained of various forms of restraint on its freedom and has
 undertaken strikes and demonstrations to publicize its cause.
 There are no private or independent radio or television
 stations, although the Government and the Parliament are
 discussing the establishment of independent media outlets.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Lithuania witnessed a large number of mass meetings and public
 gatherings without interference from Lithuanian or Soviet
 authorities. According to the Ministry of Justice, there are
 currently no laws that prohibit or restrict public gatherings,
 even on the grounds of public order. Large numbers of
 Lithuanians stood vigil outside the Parliament in Vilnius on
 numerous occasions, especially during the January events. Mass
 gatherings also took place on the occasion of funerals for
 those who died in January and July. The Lithuanian Popular
 Front, Sajudis, held several large rallies in Vilnius without
 incident, as did Lithuanian trade unionists and supporters of
 the Soviet presence in Lithuania.
 The 1990 basic law respects the right of Lithuanians to
 associate freely, requiring only that they inform the Government
 of large gatherings or demonstrations. The authorities are
 working on regulations for the issuance of permits. However,
 the Lithuanian Parliament on August 22 outlawed the Moscow-
 backed Communist Party in Lithuania in light of its activities
 in January and August and seized Communist Party properties.
 It also banned other organizations associated with the Soviet
 occupation authorities.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There have been no arbitrary restrictions on the exercise of
 religious freedom since the declaration of independence. The
 Government recognizes no state religion and actively supports
 religious diversity. The former Jesuit college in Kaunas was
 reestablished, and numerous Catholic churches around the country
 
 
 1171
 LITHUANIA
 were reopened. A Jewish Culture Center was established in
 Vilnius.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Before Lithuania achieved full independence, Soviet authorities
 possessed the means to exert control over movement within and
 into the country but generally did not interfere with such
 movement. Since recognizing Lithuania's indepeudence, Soviet
 border control personnel have worked closely wtiih Lithuanian
 authorities to ,monitor cross-boKder traffic. Under Lithuanian
 law, Lithuanian citizens are permitted fee'movement within,
 and re.turn to, Lithuania.      I"
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 . to Change Their Government
 Lithuania is now a parliamentary democracy. There are no
 political parties as such, but the members of Parliament are
 divided according to groups. At present there are nine groups,
 and more are likely to be formed. They differ on matters of
 ideology, national identity, and personal or political loyalty.
 Nearly all derive from the Sajudis movement, which was a broadly
 based, proindependence and proreform movement that led the
 nation to independence. Elections are called by Parliament at
 5-year intervals and are freely conducted by secret ballot
 available in the Lithuanian, Russian, and Polish languages.
 Suffrage is universal. There was one byelection in 1991, and
 one local election is slated for March 1992.
 There are no restrictions on women's participation in politics
 or government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Lithuanian authorities actively encouraged international and
 nongovernmental human rights groups to travel to Lithuania to
 bear witness to the effects of Soviet repression as well as to
 investigate allegations of Lithuanian mistreatment of
 minorities. Members of the U.S. Commission on Security and
 Cooperation in Europe visited Lithuania on several occasions,
 as did members of international human rights organizations.
 According to the Lithuanian Government, several domestic human
 rights groups have already been registered, and more are
 expected to follow.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Lithuanian Constitution prohibits discrimination based on
 race, sex, religion, or ethnic background. Non-Lithuanian
 ethnic groups, comprising about 20 percent of the population,
 include Russians, Jews, and Poles.
 Relations between Lithuanian authorities and non-Lithuanian
 communities, especially the sizable Polish community in Vilnius
 and the southwest region of Lithuania, are strained. In the
 spring, representatives of the Polish community voted to
 establish a Polish autonomous region in Lithuania which the
 Government of Lithuania declared illegal. After the August
 coup attempt, Lithuanian authorities removed local officials
 elected in the regions inhabited by a majority of Poles,
 
 
 -1172
 LITHUANIA
 alleging that they had worked closely with Moscow and supported
 the coup attempt. Lithuanian administrators were appointed
 pending the election of new officials. Although a date for new
 local elections has not been announced, the Government has
 indicated that they must be held by September 1992.
 Non-Lithuanians, especially Poles, have alleged job and salary
 discrimination based on the imposition of Lithuanian-language
 requirements. A new citizenship law went into effect on
 December 11, 1991. While ostensibly nondiscriminatory in its
 precepts, the law mentions "Lithuanian origin" in establishing
 claims to citizenship, which could work against ethnic Poles or
 Russians who apply. The Polish community has also expressed
 concern over Lithuanian proposals to redraw administrative
 boundaries to break up predominantly Polish territorial units.
 This idea has since been dropped by the Lithuanian authorities.
 The Constitution provides the same rights for women as for men.
 Women also possess significant maternity and day-care benefits.
 Official policy specifies equal pay for equal work. However,
 in Lithuanian society in general, there are inequalities based
 on sex. Women are underrepresented in the political leadership,
 in some professions, and in the still emerging new management
 class.
 Statistics are not available on the incidence of abuse directed
 at women. Fledgling women's rights organizations are attempting
 to increase public awareness of women's issues in the country.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Prior to the August coup attempt, Lithuanian workers remained
 largely subject to Soviet labor law, which did not permit the
 right to associate freely in practice. The Lithuanian branch
 of the U.S.S.R.'s All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions
 adapted to the trend toward Lithuanian independence by renaming
 itself the Confederation of Free Trade Unions. However, by its
 own admission, its membership is 70 percent Communist. In
 January Communist-backed unions struck briefly in support of
 Soviet authorities. During the August coup attempt, the
 Confederation did not denounce the plotters. A genuinely free,
 independent trade union called the Lithuanian Workers Union
 (LDS) which emerged in 1990 was permitted, following the failure
 of the coup attempt, to take over the headquarters that the
 Government had confiscated from the Confederation. A third
 grouping that is close to the Social Democrats also emerged in
 1991.
 Since the coup, Lithuania has adopted legislation reconfirming
 the right of workers to form independent unions and, with
 certain restrictions, to strike. However, the LDS maintains
 that its organizing efforts are still hampered by the holdover
 Communist managers in many enterprises.
 On October 4, Lithuania was formally readmitted to the
 International Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Under Soviet law, Lithuanian workers did not have the right to
 organize outside the official trade union system, and free
 collective bargaining did not exist in practice. Lithuanian
 legislation since the coup confirms the right to organize and
 
 
 1173
 LITHUANIA
 bargain collectively, but plant level bargaining is only in its
 infancy. Since the economy is still predominantly in the hands
 of the State, the unions seek redress at the political level.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.
 Compulsory labor was a feature of Soviet-administered prisons
 in Lithuania; it has since been banned.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Government has retained the minimum age for employment of
 childrdn at 16, and it has added 1 year to compulsory education,
 bringing the total to 12 years of schooling. Lithuanian
 authorities enforce minimum age and compulsory education laws
 through a system of inspections.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Labor conditions in Lithuania were similar to, but sometimes
 better than, those in the Soviet Union. According to known
 Soviet statistics, wages in all categories of workers in
 Lithuania were above the Soviet average. By law, white-collar
 ,workers enjoy a 40-hour workweek; blue-collar staff, a 48-hour
 workweek with, premium pay for overtime.
 Soviet and Lithuanian laws establish minimum health and safety
 standards for the workplace. However, worker complaints
 indicate that these standards seem frequently to be ignored.
