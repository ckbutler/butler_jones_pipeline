 GABON
 Gabon gained independence from Fr.ance in 1960, and Leon Mba,
 leader of the Bloc Democratique Gabonais, forerunner of
 the present Democratic Party of Gabon, was elected
 president. Gabon has been a single party state in which
 political power is effectively concentrated in the presidency
 .since the accession to that office by El Hadj Omar Bongo in
 1969. President Bongo was re-elected president in 1973 and
 again in January 1980. A 93-member National Assembly,
 chosen from a single slate proposed by the party, functions
 regularly, but has little influence. The legal system is
 based upon French civil law, customary law, and the 1961
 constitution. There has been no significant opposition to
 the present leadership since President Bongo's accession to
 ,the presidency. The right of integrity of the person is
 generally respected; political rights are circumscribed
 by the existence of the single party system.
 1.     Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law. There have been no reports
 that it was practiced in 1980 or in recent years.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There are no reports of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment
 or punishment. There are no summary executions. Capital
 punishment is permitted by law but is rarely imposed and, in
 the three known cases this decade, only after public trial
 and conviction of murder. Prison conditions are austere,
 with rudimentary and frequently crowded facilities. Visits
 of family members, however, are permitted, and in cases
 where medical attention is required, the prisoner seems able
 to obtain it.   Arrested persons may engage attorneys of
 their choice if they can afford them; otherwise they are
 provided court-appointed counsel. There are no reports
 of differences in treatment due to type of conviction,
 social class, race, sex, or religion.
 c.   Disappearances
 There are no reports of secret arrests or clandestine
 dentention.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment are prohibited in the
 Gabonese constitution, a prohibition which appears to be
 carefully respected. No cases are known to have occurred
 in 1980. While there have been instances in the past
 involving harrassment of some foreign nationals, none is
 known to have been government-sanctioned.
 In July 1980, Amnesty International reported that two
 soldiers had been "held without trial since March 1978,
 when they were arrested on suspicion of left-wing sympathies.*
 In August 1980, the Gabonese government replied to Amnesty
 
 
 94
 International that "there has been no one, in preventive
 detention or condemned by the State Security Court, held in
 any penetentiary establishment in the country since June 19,
 1980." In November 1980, President Bongo stated that there
 were no political prisoners in Gabon. As of December, there
 are no known political prisoners in Gabon.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is guaranteea by the
 Gabonese constitution and is enforced by the courts.
 The constitution states that "the judiciary power shall be
 independent." Defendants are accorded the right to counsel.
 Charges are formally and clearly stated. There are no
 political or security courts. Appeal to higher courts is an
 integral part of the judicial system.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 The Gabonese constitution states that "the domicile shall be
 inviolable. Searches may be ordered only by a judge or
 other authorities designated by law." Nonetheless, there
 have been occasional instances in the past when non-Gabonese
 suffered invasion of their homes by hostile groups of
 Gabonese private citizens following political differences
 between Gabon and their homelands. Gabonese officials
 provided protection to those affected in these instances.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care,
 Employment and Education
 Gabon's large mineral and timber resources and its small
 population (estimated 650,000) have resulted in a high
 per capita income (estimated $3,000 - $4,000) for a de-
 veloping country. Distribution of income has been uneven,
 but the government is addressing the problem, in part, through
 programs in social services, efforts to develop an adequate
 surface transportation network, and efforts to develop
 non-subsistence agriculture and small to medium industries
 in rural areas. The economy is organized around extractive
 industries dominated by privately-owned companies with a
 large foreign involvement and substantial state participa-
 tion. Outside these relatively few pockets of economic
 activity and wealth, most of the country lives by subsis-
 tence agriculture with a modicum of cash crop activity,
 supplemented by a substantial governmental sector. Gabon is
 dependent on overseas suppliers for essential manufactured
 products and even for foodstuffs.
 The right of both men and women to hold privately-owned
 property is spelled out in the constitution and is scru-
 pulously upheld. Pay scales have been relatively high;
 minimum wage is about $200 per month. They have been
 accompanied by high prices; the inflation rate was about 15
 percent at midyear. There is little unemployment among
 Gabonese willing to work. While corruption is not uncommon,
 the problem is not a major one for Gabonese society. The
 most recent such cases, reported publicly in late 1979,
 involved Lebanese businessman and Gabonese customs agents.
 While urban women are to be found in increasing numbers in
 government, in the professions (teaching, nursing, law), in
 politics, and in service industries, their presence in the
 
 
 business life of Gabon remains very limited. In rural
 areas, women are largely restricted to their traditional
 roles in agriculture. In both rural and urban areas, the
 role of women as homemaker is still predominant.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion, and Assembly
 The constitution guarantees liberty of conscience and the
 free practice of religion,the inviolability of correspondence
 and telegraphic and telephonic communications, and the right
 to work regardless of sex, origins, religious beliefs, or
 opinions.
 There are no constitutional guarantees of freedom of
 speech, press, or assembly, however. The right to form
 associations or societies and religious communities within
 conditions established by law is guaranteed by the constitu-
 tion. Since virtually all important organizations -- unions,
 women and youth groups -- are affiliated with the sole
 political party, all political meetings require de facto
 government approval. The media are government-controlled;
 television regularly carries live news from abroad and
 some coverage of local politics. A recent television broad-
 cast review of Gabon's history since independence included
 in-depth statements from members of the erstwhile opposition
 defending their former positions. In addition, the local
 newspaper carries a daily front-page column which is frequently
 critical of some aspect of government, except the presidency.
 Since the government controls the media, any such criticism
 must have official acquiescence.   Foreign publications
 containing items critical of prevailing conditions circulate
 freely within Gabon.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within-the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions of a political nature on emigration
 or on freedom of movement within or travel outside the
 country. The right of voluntary repatriation is recognized.
 Gabonese communities abroad are miniscule; so far as is
 known, these Gabonese live abroad by choice.  A few political
 exiles from other countries live in Gabon. Until 1980, Gabon
 sheltered an estimated 60,000 Equatorial Guinean refugees,
 most of whom were more or less integrated into Gabon's
 social and economic life. Many of them remained in Gabon
 in a non-refugee status following the change in government
 in Equatorial Guinea in August, 1979.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political participation is restricted by the constitution
 to the single authorized party, the Democratic Party
 of Gabon, and its affiliated organizations. No citizen
 wishing to take part within this framework is prohibited
 from doing so. A revision of electoral procedures before
 recent national elections provided for increased opportunity
 for members of the party at the local level to choose
 candidates for the National Assembly.
 Trade unionism operates within government and party limita-
 tions. The union played little discernible role in the
 
 
 96
 outcome of a three-day teacher's strike in May 1980, called
 over salary increases. The right to strike is neither
 guaranteed nor prohibited in law, but strikes are rare and
 wildcat strikes are discouraged. Union officials are
 believed to seek government approval prior to engaging
 employers in significant trade union concerns.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violation
 of Human Rights
 There are no local organizations which systematically
 report and contest human rights violations.  There were no
 known cases in 1980 of external non-governmental human rights
 groups seeking to conduct investigations of alleged violations
 inside Gabon. The U.N. High Commmissioner for Refugees
 still maintains an office in Libreville, even though there
 are no longer refugees in Gabon.
