 ITALY
 Italy is a longstanding, multiparty parliamentary democracy. Executive authority
 is vested in the Council of Ministers, headed by the President of the Council (the
 Prime Minister). The Head of State (the President of the Republic) nominates the
 Prime Minister after consulting with leaders of all political forces in Parliament.
 Parliament was elected in free and democratic elections in Ajiril. The judiciary is
 independent but critics complain that some magistrates are politicized.
 The armed forces are under the control of the Government and Parliament. There
 are four separate police forces under different ministerial or local authorities. Under
 exceptional circumstances, the Government may call on the army to provide secu-
 rity. The army supports the police in general guard duties in Sicily, a region with
 
 
 984
 a high level of organized crime, thus freeing police resources for investigative and
 related activities. There were a number of credible reports that some members of
 the security forces committed abuses.
 Italy has an advanced, industrialized market economy, and the standard of living
 is high. Small and midsized companies employ some 70 to 80 percent of the work
 force. Major products include machinery textiles, apparel, transportation equip-
 ment, and food and agricultural products. he Government owns a substantial num-
 ber of enterprises in finance, communications, industry, transportation, and serv-
 ices, but privetization is moving forward at a measured pace.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. The law and
 the judiciay generally provide effective means of dealing with instances of individ-
 ual abuse. However, there were problems in some areas. There continued to be re-
 ports of police abuse of detainees, although abuse of inmates by prison guards de-
 clined. Pidsons are overcrowded, and the pace of "justice remains slow. Societal dis-
 crimination a~int women, abuse of children, and discrimination and sporadic vio-
 lence against immigrants and other foreigners are problems. Parliament passed new
 comprehensive legislation to protect women agais violence and sexual abuse.
 There were some reports of child labor in the underground economy.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 Twyo Trn polie ofier wer     rught to trial on  nslaughtr carges in 199
 for beating a suspect to death after his arrest in December 1993. n January 1995,
 a court acquitted beth officers, finding that one officer's use of physical force had
 been within the limits of the law. The suspect's family appealed i April 1995, but
 a hearing had not been scheduled b year's end.
 The trial of four suspects charged wth the March 1993 killing of an Iranian oppo-
 sition leader took place in September. The court acit  three of the suspects for
 insufficient evidence and the fourth was considered beyond the jurisdiction of the
 court by reason of diplomatic immunity.
 b. Disappearane.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearanes.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture and cruel or degrading punishment. However, there have
 been some reports of abuse by police. Amnesty International (Al), the United Na-
 tions Huma n     t             (UNHRC), the UN. Committee Against Torture,
 and the Council of Europe's European Committee for the Prevention of Torture
 (ECrTe reported instances in which police abused detainees, commonly at the time
 of arrest or during the first 24 hours in custody, before detainees saw an attorney
 or a judicial authority. Examples of mistreatment include kicking, punching, beat-
 ings with batons, or deprivation of food. A high proportion of these cases involve
 non-European Union immigrants (mostly Africans), Rom , and persons held in con-
 nection with drg-related offenses. The U.N. Committee and the UNHRC expressed
 concern over a pocsible trend towards racism. Amnesty international (Al), the
 UNHRC and the U.N. Committee noted that, although authorities routinely inves-
 tigate con laints of mistreatment in detention, some of the investigations lack thor-
 ou ness. The UN. Committee and the UNHRC also questioned whether appro-
 prate sanctions were imposed on those found guilty. Italy has ratified all of the
 principal international instruments prohibiting torture and cruel, inhuman, or de-
 ding treatment or punishment but the ECPT and the UNHRC reommended
 tateauhorities take more effective steps to safeguard detainees and inmates
 from poor treatment. The ECPT's first visit to Italian prisons was in March 1992.
 Another visit took place in October 1995, but the report on that visit was not avail-
 able by year's end.
 Amnesty International rrl specic instances of mistreatment by law
 enforcement and prison officers. One involved the alleged beating and verbal abuse
 of the driver of a ear by police officers acting as bodyguards for a judge in Sicily.
 Although the driver was released without charge, he had to be treated at a hospital
 for a perforated ear drum and bruises. He lodged a formal written complaint with
 the local judiciary in June 1995 and was given oral confirmation that October that
 judicial proceedings had been opened on his case. In another case, a Ghanaian citi-
 zen resident in Denmark was reportedly beaten by plice officers at the Rome air-
 port because they suspected him of travelling with illegal documentation. Although
 hewas    rmittedto ontinue his journey the next day, he allegedly suffered hearing
 loss in one ear and facial disfigurement. The Ghanaian fied a written account of
 his experience with the Italian Embassy in Denmark. In addition Al reported that
 
 
 985
 an Italian citizen of Nigerian origin was beaten by two police officers when she
 failed to produce identity documents upon their request. InMay the prosecutor's of-
 fice requested that the two officers involved be tried on charges of abuse of author-
 ity, t   t, and causing injury. The prosecutor also asked that the woman be
 charged for resisting and insulting public officials, refusing to identify herself, and
 causing injury. Prebminary hearings have been scheduled.
 Prisn standards meet international levels. However, despite the creation of new
 prison space and a drop of almost 5 percent in the total jail population (due mainly
 toalawpassedin1995changingthetermsofpreventivedetention), the prison po
 ulation exceeds maximum capacity of the nation's prisons by some 20 percent. In
 some cases, the number of inmates is two or three times greater than capacity.
 Overcrowding creates problems of poor sanitation and strains medical services, so
 much so that it was noted as a negative factor by the EOPT in its report on prison
 conditions after a visit in 1992 (Published in Italy in 1995). AIDS is a maior prob-
 lem alhouh te lw alow jugesto elese risner whso etntion would pre-
 vent access to appropriate treatment or endanger the health of other inmates. Ac-
 cording to data of the Association of Prison Doctors, about 5 percent of the total
 prison population is HIV positive. There were 43 suicides as of early December, com-
 parering 1995.
 The number of allegations of abuse of prisoners by guards is decreasing. In De-
 cember 1994, the Naples judiciary committed to trial 71 prison officials of the
 Secondigliano prison, including the chief warden, on charges of mistreating some
 300 inmates in early 1993. A court hearing for 65 of the defendants, all of them
 prison guards, began in March.
 The Government rermits independent monitoring of prison conditions by par-
 liamentarians, local  Iuan rights groups, the media, and other organizations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-In response to public concern over exces-
 sive use of preventive or investigative detention, Parliament passed a new law in
 1995 clarifying that preventive detention can be imposed only as a last resort, or
 if there is clear and convincing evidence of a serious offense, such as crimes involv-
 ing the Mafia, or those related to drugs, arms, or subversion. In these cases, a maxi-
 mum of 2 years of preliminary investigation is permitted. Except in extraordinary
 situations, preventive custody is not permitted for pregnant women, single parents
 of children under 3 years of age, persons over 70 years of age, or those who are seri-
 ously ill. Despite these added protections, the practice of preventive detention re-
 emerged as a concern when a former Senator accused of mafia-related crimes, who
 had fled Italy for 4 months but was returning to face the charges, committed suicide
 in August.
 Detainees are allowed prompt and regular access to lawyers of their choosing (al-
 though occasional lapses in this general rule have been alleged) and to family mem-
 bers. If a detainee is indigent, the State provides a lawyer. The preliminary hearing
 judge's interrogation of an accused person must be conducted within 5 days, or the
 defendant must be released. Interrogation by a magistrate of a person in custody
 must be recorded on video or audio tape, or the statements cannot be utilized in
 any proceedings. The prosecutor is required to include in his request for preventive
 measures all evidence favorable to the accused. In addition the defense may present
 any favorable evidence directly to the court.
 Preventive custody can be imposed only for crimes punishable by a maximum sen-
 tence of not less than 4 years.
 There is no provision for bail, but judges may grant provisional liberty to suspects
 awaiting trial. As a safeguard against unjustified detention, panels of judges ("lib-
 erty tribunals') review cases of persons awaiting trial and decide whether continued
 detention is warranted. Despite these measures, as of mid-1996, 40 percent of in-
 mates were in prison because they were awaiting either trial or the outcome of an
 appeal, rather than because they had been finally sentenced. The Constitution and
 law provide for restitution in cases of unjust detention.
 Punishment by exile abroad is not practiced, and the law prohibits domestic exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is formally autonomous, but the
 Constitution gives the Justice Minister the right to propose disciplinary action
 against magistrates. Friction between the magistrates and the Justice Ministry can
 develop when this right is exercised.
 There are three levels of courts. The lower level has three separate tracks: Praetor
 Courts for offenses punishable by monetary fines or imprisonment for not more than
 4 years; a Court of Assizes for crimes punishable by prison terms of more than 24
 years; and a Tribunal Court for offenses falling between the jurisdiction of the first
 two. The Assizes Court of Appeals hears appeals from all three tracks. Decisions at
 this level can be further appealed to the highest level, the Court of Cssation, which
 is headquartered in Rome.
 
 
 986
 The law provides for trials to be fair and public, and the authorities observe these
 provisions. The law grants defendants the presumption of innocence. Trials are pub-
 lic, and defendants have access to an attorney sufficiently in advance to prepare a
 defense. Defendants can confront witnesses. All government-held evidence is nor-
 mally made available to defendants and their attorneys. Defendants can appeal ver-
 dicts to the highest appellate court.
 Cumbersome procedures slow the pace of justice. The average waiting period for
 trials is about 18 months. The Code of Criminal Procedure that took effect in 1989 .
 sought to streamline the process, but it has not produced substantial improvement.
 The European Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of two Italian citizens who
 claimed that their rights had been violated by the length of the proceedings in their
 case. They were arrested on February 13, 1976, charged with murder, and after
 trials and appeals, the Court of Cassation gave a final ruling on February 28, 1992.
 The European Court ordered the Italian Government to pay $16,000 (24 million lire)
 to one of the accused and $10,000 (15 million lire) to the other, plus their court
 costs.
 Since 1991 public prosecutors have conducted sweeping investigations into high
 level corruption. These inquiries continue and enjoy public support. However, there
 are critics who complain that some investigating magistrates are occasionally influ-
 enced by political or other interests in choosing targets of inquiry, or sometimes fail
 to show adequate respect for the rights of the suspects, by, for example, making ex-
 cessive use of preventive detention (see Section 1.). In addition, since 1993 more
 than 200 magistrates have come under judicial investigation on charges of corrup-
 tion, collusion, or mafia-related crimes. At least 15 were arrested and several others
 were committed to trial.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interence Wth Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 safeguards the privacy of the home, and the authorities respect this provision.
 Searches and electronic monitoring may be carried out only under judicial warrant
 and in carefully defined circumstances. Violations are subject to legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of speech and the
 press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independent press,
 an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to en-
 sure freedom of speeh and of the press, including academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government does not re-
 strict the right ofpeaceful assembly, including prtests against government policies,
 except in cases where national security or public safety is at risk. Permits are not
 required for meetings, but organizers of public demonstrations must notify the
 lice in advance. Professional and employer associations organize and operate freely.
 While allowing general freedom of association, the Constitution and law prohibit
 clandestine associations, those that pursue political aims through force, that incite
 racial, ethnic, or religious discrimination, or that advocate fascism.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and the
 Government respects this rit. The Government subsidizes the Roman Catholic
 Church, the Adventist Churc, and the Assemblies of God by allowing taxpayers to
 elect to designate a fixed percentage of their tax payment to one or another of these.
 In November 1993 the Buddhist community applied for the same funding, but the
 Government has not yet responded.
 Roman Catholic religious instruction is offered in public schools as an optional
 subject. Those students who do not want to attend the "hour of religion" may take
 an alternative course.
 d. Freedom of Mocement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution and law provide for these rights, and the Government
 respects them in practice. Citizens who leave are guaranteed the right to return.
 The Constitution forbids deprivation of citizenship for political reasons.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. It provides first asylum for
 refugees fleeing hostilities or natural disasters, for example. In these cases the refu-
 gees are granted temporary residence permits that must be renewed periodically
 and that carry no guarantee of future permanent residence. In 1996 the number of
 such refugees present in Italy, coming largely from the Balkans, declined to 49,630.
 The Government also provides political asylum, often for permanent residence, and
 120 permits were granted in 1996 for political asylees. There were no reports of
 forced expulsion of any persons having valid claim to refugee status.
 
 
 987
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 All citizens over the age of 18 have the right to vote, by secret ballot, for the 630
 members of the Chamber of Deputies. Those over 25 have the right to vote for 315
 of the 325 members of the Senate, which also has 10 nonelected members, such as
 former Presidents of the Republic. Elections must be held every 5 years, or sooner
 if the President of the Republic so orders.
 Parliament and a few representatives of regional bodies jointly elect the President
 of the Republic for a 7-year term. The Constitution states that the President need
 not be a member of Parliament, but must be over age 50. The President nominates
 the Prime Minister, who is the head of the executive and who in turn selects the
 cabinet members.
 There are no restrictions in law on women's participation in government and poli-
 tics. Fewer women than men, however, are office holders: in 1995 women held 3 of
 23 cabinet positions. Women hold 25 of 325 Senate seats, and 63 of 630 seats in
 the Chamber of Deputies.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction,
 investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government offi-
 cials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, sex (except with regard to
 hazardous work-see below), religion, ethnic background, or political opinion, and
 provides some protection against discrimination based on disability, language, or so-
 cial status. However, societal discrimination persists to some degree.
 Women.-Legislation to protect women from physical abuse, including from mem-
 bers of their family was updated and strengthened in February. The law regards
 spousal rape the same as any other rape.
 Media reports of domestic violence are common, and Telefono Rosa, a prominent
 nongovernmental organization, reports that its hot line for assistance in cases of vio-
 lence against family members received 1,621 calls in 1995 (latest available figures).
 The same organization reports that rape cases filed with the courts were 1,863 for
 199J5, compared with 1,_689 for 1994 (latest available figures).
 Law enforcement and court officials are not reluctant to bring perpetrators of vio-
 lence against women to justice, but victims sometimes d not press charges due to
 fear, shame, or ignorance of the law. The new legislation passed in February makes
 prosecution of perpetrators of violence against women easier and shelters women
 wvho have been objects of attack from publicity. The Government provides a hot line
 through which abused women can obtain legal, medical, and other assistance. In
 May the city of Milan opened a clinic served by 40 doctors to provide free medical
 assistance to abused women and minors. Women's associations also maintain sev-
 eral shelters for battered women.
 The media report cases of trafficking in women, often involving forced prostitu-
 tion. The women (as well as their exploiters) are usually illegal immigrants and are
 therefore reluctant to contact the police. Nevertheless, the police have been able to
 make arrests on several occasions.
 There are a number of government offices that work to ensure women's rights.
 The Prodi Government created a new cabinet-level position, the Office of Minister
 for Equal Opportunity, and named a woman to this position. In addition there is
 an Equal Opportunity Commission within the Office of the Prime Minister. Another
 such commission is in the Labor Ministry and focuses on discrimination and wom-
 en's rights in the workplace. The Labor Ministry has a counselor who deals with
 these problems at the national level, and similar officials serve with regional and
 provincial governments. Many of these counselors, however, have limited resources
 or   ir work.
 Some laws intended to protect women from hazardous work keep them out of jobs
 such as night shis or underground work in mines a,       or tunnels. Maternity
 leave, intrduced to benefit women, does add to the cost of employing them, with
 the result that em ployers sometimes find it advantageous to hire men instead.
 Women generally receive lower salaries than men for comparable work. They are
 underrepresented in many fields, such as management or the professions (women,
 for example, account for only 25 percent of magistrates and only 10 percent of police
 officers). Women are often laid off more frequently than men.
 
 
 988
 While the law does not specifically prohibit sexual harassment, labor agreements
 covering broad sectors of the economy, in both the private and public sectors, do con-
 tain clauses that address the problem.
 Women enjoy legal equality with men in marriage, property, and inheritance
 ri ihs.
 Tere are many groups actively and effectively involved in promoting women's
 rights. Most are close to labor unions or political parties.
 Children.-The Government demonstrated a strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare. It signed the European Convention on the Exercise of the Rights
 of Minors on January 25. It launched an extensive study of the living conditions of
 minors to serve as a data base for po~icies to improve their situation. The Ministry
 of Labor and Social Welfare and the Ministry of Public Administration brought em-
 poyers' associations, national cooperative societies, and labor unions together to
 subsribe to a pact to battle exploitation of child labor by those organizations in
 their operations both in Italy and overseas. Signatories of the pact also agreed to
 contribute an hour's wage (for labor) or its equivalent for their staffs (for organiza-
 tions) to United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and International Labor Orga-
 nization (ILO) programs aimed at improving the situation of children in less devel-
 oped countries. Nevertheless, there were credible reports of instances of child labor
 in the underground economy.
 Schooling is compulsory or children from age 7 to 14. The dropout rate for chil-
 dren in the compulsory schooling cycle is 0.75 percent for the nation as a whole,
 but 1.24 percent in the south. Boys and girls enjoy equal access and treatment with
 regard to education, health, and other government services.
 Abuse of children is a societal problem. The National Statistical Office estimated
 that 600,000 children below the age of 15 suffered abuse of some kind within the
 last 2 years. A toll free number to help abused children under 14 years of age re-
 ceived an average of 5,000 calls daily nationwide. In the period from November 1994
 to the end of May 1996, 3,580 of these calls required followup services. Social work-
 ers counsel abused children and are authorized to take action to protect them, in-
 cluding placing them in shelters.
 People With Disabilities.-The law forbids discrimination against disabled persons
 in employment education, or in the provision of state services. Legislation requires
 enterprises with more than 35 employees to draw on the disabled to staff 15 percent
 of their work force, directs that public buildings be made accessible to persons with
 disabilities, and spells out a number of specific rights for the disabled. Compliance
 with these requirements, however, is still only partial.
 NationalIRacialIEthnic Minorities.-Immigrants and other foreigners face soci-
 etal discrimination. Some were even subjected to physical attack. The Romani peo-
 ple encounter difficulties finding places for their groups to stay. The city of Rome
 opened three camps for them so far and others are expected to be opened. The
 Romani population around Rome is between 5,000 and 6,500.
 The Forum of Foreign Communities continues its work on behalf of immigrants
 and foreign residents. It has a hot line to report incidents of violence against for-
 eigners. Other nongovernmental agencies, such as Caritas, provide a broad range
 of assistance to immigrants throughout the country.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law provides for the right to establish trade
 unions, join unions, and carry out union activities in the workplace. Some 40 per-
 cent of the work force is organized. Trade unions are free of government controls
 and no longer have formal ties with political parties. The right to strike is embodied
 in the Constitution and is frequently exercised. A 1990 law restricts strikes affecting
 essential public services such as transport, sanitation, and health. Unions associate
 freely with international trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of workers to organize and bargain collectively, and these rights are re-
 spected in practice. By custom (though not by law), national collective bargaining
 agreements apply to all workers regardless of union affiliation.
 The law prohibits discrimination by employers against union members and orga-
 nizers. It requires employers who have more than 15 employees and who are found
 guilty of antiunion discrimination to reinstate the workers affected. In firms with
 less than 15 workers, an employer must state the grounds for firing a union em-
 ployee in writing. If a judge deems these grounds spurious, he can order the em-
 ployer to reinstate or compensate the worker.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition on Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and it does not occur.
 
 
 989
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law forbids employment of
 children under 15 years of age (with some limited exceptions). There are also spe-
 cific restrictions on employment in hazardous or unhealthful occupations of males
 under age 18, and females under age 21. Enforcement of minimum age laws is effec-
 tive only outside the extensive "underground" economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work Minimum wages are not set by law but rather
 by collective bargaining agreements. These specify minimum standards to which in-
 dividual employment contracts must conform When an employer and a union fail
 to reach agreement, courts may step in to determine fair wages on the basis of prac-
 tice in comparable activities or agreements.
 The law provides a maximum workweek of 48 hours, with no more than 6 days
 per week and 8 hours per day, except that the latter can be exceeded in some speci-
 eod kinds of jobs. Most ollective agree ments provide for a 36 to 38hour workweek.
 Overtime may not exceed 2 hours a day or an average of 12 hours per week.
 The law sets basic health and safety standards and guidelines for compensation
 for on-the-job injuries. European Unon directives on health and safety have also
 been incorporated into the law; some provisions have already taken effect and oth-
 ers will be phased in during 1997. Labor inspectors are from local health units or
 from the Ministry of Labor. They are few, given the scope of their responsibilities.
 Courts im     fines and sometimes prison terms for violation of health and safety
 laws. Worers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations
 without jeopardy to their continued employment.
