 IRELAND
 Ireland attaches great importance to the observance and
 maintenance of human rights. Individual liberties and
 civil rights are guaranteed and protected by the Con-
 stitution. Political institutions are democratic and
 political life is orderly. The growth of terrorist
 activities resulting from the civil unrest in Northern
 Ireland, including the assassination of the British
 Ambassador and bombings of hotels, stores and pubs in
 Dublin in 1976, caused the Irish Government to intro-
 duce legislation to combat terrorism. The Parliament
 adopted this legislation.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected
 in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Constitutional protections against such conduct are
 generally observed. Amnesty International, in a 1977
 report, expressed concern about alleged maltreatment
 of detainees or prisoners, especially where terrorism
 or other serious crimes may have been involved. In
 response, the Government appointed a special committee
 headed by a retired judge to consider the allegations
 and make recommendations on measures to safeguard the
 rights of prisoners and detainees. This Committee's
 report was made public in September 1978. The Govern-
 ment stated that a majority of the recommendations
 were either accepted or already in effect. Those
 accepted by the Government included, for example, in-
 forming those needing to know of an arrest made, and
 permitting the suspect to write his own statement.

 Those already in effect included informing the suspect
 of his rights, maintaining police logs on all develop-
 ments in arrest cases and stressing in police training
 the proper treatment of persons arrested. The
 Government withheld application of some Committee
 recommendations pending further examination and rejected
 others. Amnesty International issued a statement,
 October 9, urging the Government to reconsider several
 of the rejected proposals, such as permitting solicitors
 to attend interrogations and establishment of an inde-
 pendent complaints tribunal.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 In 1976, the spillover into the Republic of terrorist
 activities arising from the Northern Ireland situation
 led the Irish Government to declare a state of emergency
 and to allow police to detain persons for up to seven
 days without charge. A signatory of the European Con-
 vention on Human Rights, Ireland availed itself of the
 rights of derogation from the Convention until security
 conditions improved. The new Irish Government elected
 in June 1977 decided to return to a maximum period of
 two days' detention without charge. This took effect
 October 12, 1977.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed by law and respected
 in practice.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by
 law and respected in practice.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Irish Government is firmly committed to improving
 the quality of life for all its citizens. The 1978
 budget allots over forty percent of current government
 expenditures to social welfare, health and education.
 Long-standing economic policies of industrialization
 
 
 468
 and modernization have produced a substantial increase
 in the standard of living and a decrease in regional
 and occupational disparities. About forty percent of
 tax revenue comes from a progressive income tax, but
 the Government (like many European governments) relies
 heavily on indirect taxes such as value-added and ex-
 cise taxes which are by nature regressive. Economic
 modernization has been accompanied by changing social
 patterns, especially in the status of women. Legisla-
 tion requiring equal pay for equal work and providing
 unemployment benefits for single women is in effect.
 Adjustments have been effected to reduce fiscal
 disincentives for working wives. The significant gap
 in earnings between men and women is gradually
 narrowing. There is no corruption of any consequence.
 There is no discrimination on ethnic, religious or
 other grounds.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of movement, foreign travel and
 emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Irish citizens participate fully in an orderly demo-
 cratic political system. The labor movement is free
 and strong..
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Irish Government in general has a good record
 
 
 469
 regarding independent, outside investigations of
 alleged human rights abuses. A 1977 Amnesty Inter-
 national Report and the Government's response to it
 were described in Section l.b. above.
