 HAITI
 The Haitian military has effectively ruled the cour.try since its unconstitutional,
 violent overthrow and expulsion of President Jean-Bertrard Aristide in Septemb'er
 1991. From January to August, Haiti was ruled by an unconstitutional de facto re-
 gime, the second since the coup. On July 3 the military high command signed an
 agreement with President Aristide on Governors Island, New York to restore con-
 stitutional order. Pursuant to the accord, on August 30, Prime Minister Robert
 Malval, ap 3inted by President Aristide, was sworn in to office. The military high
 command failed to respect the provisions of the Governors Island accord which de-
 layed full implementation by the end of the year. Malval held de jure power
 throughout this period but was unable to effect full control of the Government, and
 actual power remained in the hands of the military and its supporters. Ministers
 in -.he Malval Government were often prevented from carrying out their duties by
 threats, violence, and other forms of intimidation. On October 14, Justice Minister
 Guy Malary was killed in downtown Port-au-Prince. Although the killers had not
 been identified by year's end, there is strong reason to believe they were supporters
 of the military. Prime Minister Malval resigned on December 15, in keeping with
 his announced intentions, but stayed on as acting Prime Minister pending appoint-
 ment of a replacement.
 The Haitian armed forces, which have considerable legal and institutional auton-
 omy, are responsible for law enforcement and public security. The police, all of
 whom are stationed in Port-au-Prince, are an integral part of the armed forces. In
 both urban and rural areas, armed forces units serve as police, despite a constitu-
 tional requirement to separate these two bodies. Paramilitary personnel in civilian
 clothes (known as "attaches" in the city or "section chiefs" and "adjoints" in rural
 avas) conduct most of the intimidation and violent repression for both the police
 and the army. Military, police, and paramilitary personnel committed numerous se-
 rious human rights violations with impunity in 1993.
 The Haitian economy is characterized by severe overpopulation vis-a-vis ever
 dwindling arable land due to environmental devatation, high infant mortality, a
 heavy dependence on imports and foreign assistance, a predominantly rural popu-
 lation living on rapidly eroding land, wide disparities of income, and a small manu-
 facturing base.  ile never strong, the economy declined in recent years, owing to
 political instability and government mismanagement. That decline continued in
 1993 and was intensified bythe Organization of American States' (OAS) trade em-
 bargo and the United Nations' fuel embargo, as well as the suspension of all but
 international humanitarian assistance following the 1991 coup.
 Haitians suffered frequent human rights abuses throughout 1993, including politi-
 cal and extrajudicial ilngs by the security forces and their allies, disappearances
 beatings and other mistreatment of detainees and prisoners, arbitrai7 arrest and
 
 
 468
 detention, executive interference with the judicial process, and continued infringe-
 ment of the rights of citizens to change their government. More than 200 civilian
 human rights observers from the United Nations and the OAS were deployed
 throughout the country from February through October when they were withdrawn
 due to perceived threats and intimidation. Their presence temporarily helped curb
 political violence and human rights violations, but indiscriminate violence remained
 substantial, especially in rural areas, where two-thirds of Haitians live. There was
 a substantial increase in crimes of violence, including politically motivated killings,
 beginning in July and August, as tensions rose over the Governors Island accords
 and military efforts to derail their implementation. Most of the violence is directed
 at stopping the transition to democracy.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Levels of violence were high
 throughout 1993 and were exacerbated by the manifest unwillingness of the mili-
 tary and de facto government to respect human rights, curb extrajudicial killings,
 and pursue criminal justice. Until its withdrawal in October, the wide-scale pres-
 ence throughout Haiti of the U.NJOAS International Civilian Mission (ICM) human
 rights observers helped prevent even greater violence.
 The ICM began formally collecting and publishing data on human rights abuses
 in June, and the mission registered over 100 homicide cases from June to Septem-
 ber. It is difficult to assess the actual number of political and extrajudicial killings,
 because judicial authorities rarely conducted criminal investigations into any unex-
 plained deaths, including violent ones such as murder, whether  litical or not. For
 example, the ICM registered a disturbing increase in killings in Port-au-Prince and
 environs in July and August. According to the ICM, the number of murders in the
 city climbed from 5 in May and 9 in June to 67 for the combined months of July
 and August. Of these 67 killings, ICM officials believe at least 7 may have been po-
 litically motivated. The ICM registered three deaths in official custody from sus-
 pected unnatural causes from May to August, but informed observers believed the
 number of such deaths was significantly higher. Some local groups published much
 higher estimates, but their methodology was not as careful as the ICM's and their
 figures could not be verified.
 No serious investigation of these killings was undertaken by judicial or military
 authorities. The Haitian army general staff, under strong pressure from the IC,
 transferred a few army officers for repeated abuses and dismissed one officer on
 human rights grounds in 1993. As a general pattern, however, the military avoided
 disciplining even flagrant abusers. An army corporal accused of the August murder
 of a peasant in the Central Plateau was transferred to a nearby department. Al-
 though initially described by military authorities as "under arrest and investiga-
 tion, the soldier was, in fact, loosely confined to barracks, and there was little indi-
 cation of any "ongoing" investigation.
 Elements of the military and their unpaid deputies, or "attaches," continued their
 vigilante actions, particularly in Port-au-Prince. There was strong evidence of sys-
 tematic complicity between citypolice and criminal and vigilante gangs. Attache vio-
 lence resulted in at least one death and numerous injuries at a September 8 city
 hall ceremony to mark the return of Port-au-Prince's pro-Aristide mayor, ousted fol-
 lowing the coup. Several days later, armed civilians attacked Aristide supporters
 during a church service, killing prominent pro-Aristide activist Antoine Izmery and
 one other person. Justice Minister Guy Malary was similarly murdered in public on
 October 14. No investigation or arrests have been made in either case.
 One homicide case with political implications was investigated by judicial authori-
 ties during the year: the July 1991 torture and murder of five youths while in police
 custody. Following the arrest of the policeman accused of the murder, President
 Aristide publicly praised him in a September 11, 1991, speech. A Port-au-Prince
 magistrate determined in July, despite compelling evidence to the contrary, that
 "reasonable doubt" existed concerning the guilt of the accused policeman and
 dropped all charges.
 b. Disappearance.-Haitian human rights advocates point out that, because many
 Aristide activists remained in hiding, it was difficult to verify reports of disappear-
 ances. The ICM recorded 1 reported disappearance between February and May,
 then 10 in June. There were eight abduction and subsequent release cases and five
 disappearances in July and August. Historically, the "disappeared" in Haiti are ei-
 ther never found or found murdered. Increased political tension in the latter half
 of the year may have altered and exacerbated patterns of violent intimidation.
 
 
 The bullet-riddled body of a relative of a local journalist was discovered July 13
 on the coastal road north of Port-au-Prince. The journalist had photographed sol.
 diers pistol-whipping their way to the front of a gas line durin the U.N.OAS fuel
 embargo. After an independent local daily published the photo, the reporter was ar-
 rested and beaten and family members were harassed, leading to the disappearance
 and murder of the journalist's cousin. Criminal elements associated with Port-au-
 Prince's 22nd police company were suspected of involvement in the crime; the Gov-
 ernment took no action to investigate or prosecute.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumane, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution guarantees each citizen the right to life, health, respect of the
 human person, and individual liberty. In addition the Constitution prohibits unnec-
 essary force or restraint, psychological pressure, or physical brutality. These con-
 stitutional protections were largely ignored, and ill-treatment remained widespread,
 particularly the threat of physical violence used by police and soldiers to extort
 money from detainees and their families. Brutal beatings with fists and clubs, tor-
 ture, and other cruel treatment of detainees were common. In June a pregnant
 woman arrested for theft in the southern town of Jeremie was beaten so badly that
 she lost her child.
 Three labor leaders arrested and beaten in April were held at the Port-au-Prince
 military hospital for several days following their legal release. They were probably
 detained and treated at the military hospital because the extent of their injuries
 would have aroused local and international outrage had they been released imme-
 diately.
 Prison conditions are abysmal. Detainees regularly have no access to lege.l counsel
 and continue to suffer from a lack of the most basic hygienic facilities as well as
 inadequate food and health care. Children are regularly detained together with
 adults in violation of the rule that children should be detained separately. The 1987
 Constitution calls for prisons to be administered by the Ministry of Justice. The
 army continues to control them, although the military authorities have asked to be
 relieved of responsibility for prison administration. The ICM attempted to monitor
 prison conditions throughout the country and to prepare registers of all prisoners
 but periodically was denied access to prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrest and detention remain
 among the most persistent human rights abuses in Haiti. The ICM recorded more
 than 300 cases of arbitrary arrest from June to August. According to the Constitu-
 tion, a person may be arrested only if apprehended during the commission of a
 crime or if a judicial warrant has been issued and must be brought before a judge
 within 48 hours of arrest. In practice, however, arbitrary arrest and detention as
 well as interrogation without legal counsel present are common and are frequently
 used by soldiers and provincial officials to intimidate and extort money from the
 populace. The frequency of this practice makes it difficult to determine the number
 of arrests on purely political grounds.
 The Constitution calls for the separation of the police from the military, with the
 civilian police under Justice Ministry authority. One goal of the Governors Island
 accord was passage of enabling legislation aimed at finally separating the police
 from the army. On the basis of this legislation and with U.N.-sponsored training
 and assistance for the new police force, a new rural police force was to be deployed
 to the provinces to replace the infamous "section chiefs," a form of local constabulary
 in rural areas who are responsible for numerous arbitrary arrests. Section chiefs
 commonly obtained their positions by bribing the military commanders who appoint
 them, recouping their "investment" in turn by accepting money from individuals
 called attaches or adjoints who also extort money from the peasant population tinder
 threat of arbitrary arrests and beatings.
 Politically active clergy were frequently victims of arbitrary arrest and harass-
 ment by the military and the paramilitary attaches, as part of a more general in-
 timidation campaign against Aristide sympathizers, particularly in the countryside.
 In February pro-Aristide bishop Willy Romelus was attacked by civilians after giv-
 ing a funeral mass at the Port-au-Prince cathedral. The bishop was escorted from
 the cathedral site by U.NJOAS civilian observers. Arrests and harassment of jour-
 nalists are frequent and form part of an overall pattern of government and military
 intimidation of the media.
 Two American citizens were illegally detained in 1993, at the behest of relatives,
 in cases involving family land disputes. One American citizen was illegally detained
 for "lack of respect to a uniformed police officer on duty."
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-This right is widely and severely abridged. The
 Constitution provides for an independent judiciary and the right to a fair public
 trial. It expressly denies police and judicial authorities the right to interrogate per-
 sons charged with a crime unless the suspect has legal counsel present or waives
 
 
 470
 this right. Nevertheless, interrogation without legal counsel present is the norm,
 and the use of beatings and torture to extract confessions is widespread. Moreover
 contempt for the judiciary dating back to the Duvalier regime rendered it a vestigial
 branch of government, understaffed, poorly trained, and inadequately compensated.
 Seven years after the Duvaliers' fall, the judicial branch's lamentable state has not
 improved. All governments since 1986 have continued the practice of appointing and
 removing judges at will and of exerting political influence at every stage of the judi-
 cial process.
 The Code of Criminal Procedure does not clearly assign responsibility to inves-
 tigate crimes and there are no penalties for delay or inaction. Authority to pros-
 ecute is divided among police, prosecutors, and investigating magistrates. Overlap-
 ping authority invites the abdication of responsibility and encourages tacit complic-
 ity in widespread corruption.
 The Code also stipulates two criminal court sessions per year to try all major
 crimes requiring a jury trial. These sessions usually last only 2 weeks, and in some
 years only one session is held. Failure to reform the Code has resulted in a huge
 acklog, with detainees sometimes waiting years in pretrial detention for a court
 date. A U.S. citizen charged with murder (he was 15 years old at the time he was
 alleged to have committed the crime) has been detained for more than 2 years
 awaiting trial. Taking the month of April as an example, the Port-au-Prince metro-
 politan military announced total arrests for the month to have been 1,018. Some 212
 prisoners were released in April, with 90 referred to the public prosecutors' office
 or possible charges. During the same month, the Chamber of Deputies' Justice
 Committee counted 700 prisoners at the National Penitentiary, including about 250
 military prisoners. Fewer than 100 of the total penitentiary population were actu-
 ally serving sentences. The rest were accused persons held without bail. If the ac-
 cused is ultimately tried and found innocent, he has no recourse against the Govern-
 ment for time already served.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-
 Throughout 1993 there were many credible reports of soldiers and other armed per-
 sons entering private homes for illegal purposes. Similar arbitrary searches were
 equally common in the provinces, with clergy suspected of pro-Aristide sympathies
 a particular target. In addition armed urban bandits called "zenglendos" violently
 raided entire neighborhoods of Port-au-Prince, confident that the police, with whom
 they are alleged to have strong ties, would not intervene.
 Police roadblocks were also used frequently to conduct illegal searches, especially
 during periods of real or perceived political tension. In January police beat and held
 at gunpoint a foreign missionary at a police roadblock for having in his possession
 weekly newspapers, sold openly in Port-au-Prince, which mentioned President
 Aristide. Police shot and wounded another foreigner in February for accidentally
 running a roadblock. The discovery of pro-Aristide posters or literature during a po-
 lice search of a house or vehicle frequently resulted in illegal arrest. There were
 credible reports that police and military also seized private correspondence during
 such searches.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press. -Freedom of speech and the press is provided
 for by the Constitution but is often abridged because of intimidation and self-censor-
 ship. With an illiteracy rate of approximately 80 percent, broadcast media, espe-
 cially Creole-language radio, have unusual importance, and independent broadcast
 media were particular targets. In February Conatel, the Haitian board governing
 communications, invoked a Duvalier-era decree to order all radio station directors
 to suppress all information that might "alarm the populace."
 Nineteen radio stations operate in Port-au-Prince, 11 of which offer news pro-
 gramming. Four radio stations operatingbefore the coup closed permanently. News
 broadcasts exercise sporadic self-censorship, conditioned by events and political ten-
 sions. Print media enjoyed greater freedom, possibly as a result of their relatively
 small readership. Two independent daily newspapers operate in Port-au-Prince; pro-
 Aristide weeklies published in Haiti and in the United States were freely sold in
 the streets, although vendors of some of these publications were harassed sporadi-
 cally. The army and the police also frequently harassed, beat, or detained persons
 they found in possession of pro-Aristide literature. There were numerous incidents
 of illegal detention and petty harassment of radio and print journalists during 1993.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association. -The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, but these rights were severely restricted fol-
 lowing the 1991 coup d'etat. There were credible reports from all parts of Haiti that
 the military en age in a systematic effort to inhibit any type of association during
 1993. Soldiers fired into the air to disperse gatherings. Some community organizers,
 
 
 even of nonpolitical organizations, were arrested and sometimes beaten harassed,
 or intimidated into fleeing their own communities. Grasasrots liberation theology or-
 ganizations in the countryside remain a strong base of support for President
 Aristide. These groups and their leaders were particular targets of military and
 paramilitary harassment, such as short-term arrests clearly intended to intimidate.
 These arrests often followed the discovery of pro-Aristide materials during illegal
 military searches of homes, vehicles, and church rectories. Most civic education,
 community health, and literacy organizations were prevented from operating nor-
 mally.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Religion is an integral part of Haitian life and culture
 and is practiced widely. Roman Catholicism and voodoo (a mixture of African beliefs
 and Christianity) are the two major religions. Members of various Protestant de-
 nominations and foreign missionary groups openly seek converts. There are no gov-
 ernment restrictions on missionary activities, affiliations with overseas coreligion-
 ists, or religious instruction or publishing.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation. -There were credible reports that many Haitians moved from one area
 of the country to another to evade abusive local authorities. Estimates of those num-
 bers vary widely, and a lack of statistics make it difficult to establish the actual
 number. However, it is likely that several thousand Haitians are internally dis-
 placed.
 There were no cases of government restriction on foreign travel in 1993. Although
 the clandestine departure of migrants is technically a violation of Haitian immigra-
 tion law and punishable by fines or jail sentences, the authorities made only token
 efforts to interfere with such migration, occasionally in the form of soliciting small
 bribes to permit departure. Authorities intermittently detained and prosecuted sus-
 pected organizers of the voyages.
 Throughout 1993 U.S. authorities engaged in interdiction and repatriation of ille-
 fal Haitian migrants bound for the United States. Although Haitian boat people
 face the same difficult conditions affecting Haitians in general, in interviews the
 U.S. Embassy refugee program has conducted with returnees, no credible claims of
 retribution have been made by those repatriated Haitians who are not involved in
 organizing the voyages. Persons suspected of organizing the illegal departuresare
 generally taken into police custody and detained briefly. Since February 1992, the
 .S. Embassy and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) have provided
 in-country processingof refugee applications by Haitians claiming well-founded fear
 of persecution, and INS has granted refugee status to approximately 2,000 Haitians
 who are then transported to the United States.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The right of citizens to change their government was forcibly abridged by the Sep-
 tember 1991 military coup, and again in October 1993 when the army and its allies
 refused to implement the Governors Island accords. President Aristide was forced
 to flee the country after the coup, and most senior members of his administration
 either went into hiding, fled the country, or took refuge in foreign embassies.
 The Parliament and such local officials as mayors were elected along with Presi-
 dent Aristide at the end of 1990. Some local elected officials were persecuted and
 ousted from office after the coup. Members of Parliament remained in place and
 have played a continuing role in political events since the coup. In January the de
 facto government mandated, pursuant to an "executive order," by-elections for nine
 senate and four chamber seats. Pro-Aristide political parties refused to run for the
 vacant seats. The by-elections were conducted irregularly and the results were not
 recognized by the international community. Members of Parliament and leaders of
 politic al parties agreed at the United Nations in July that those eleted to par-
 liamentary seats in January would refrain from participating in legislative business
 until a solution to the problem could be found by the incoming constitutional gov-
 ernment.
 There are no de     impediments to women's participation in politics or govern-
 ment. De facto impediments include economic factors such as poorer families "-a-
 tioning" education money to pay school fees for male children only, and the general
 lower status of women which limits their role in these fields.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 About a dozen local human rights groups exist in Haiti, but only a few were ac-
 tive. All of the local human rights groups depended upon five attorneys in Port-au-
 Prince who offered pro bono legal defense assistance. These attorneys were also
 
 
 training paralegals to defend cases in the provinces. Human rights organization offi-
 cials reported repeated threats but still managed to operate relatively freely. Hai-
 tian human rights figures and groups have publicly criticized the Government, al-
 though more so under the previous de facto regime than in the late-1993 political
 climate of intimidation and increased violence. Most such groups do not have the
 means or training to investigate government activities. One human rights group
 conducted a prison visit/reform program during 1993. The program halted when the
 group's director was threatened by armed civilians who- invaded his home in late
 October; the director ultimately was forced to leave the country.
 The ICM, a team of international human rights observers which eventually num-
 bered more than 200, were deployed throughout Haiti under U.N. and OAS auspices
 until October. The ICM's activities were largely tolerated by military and de facto
 civilian authorities, although access to prisons was blocked intermittently by local
 officials. On two occasions ICM vehicles were deliberately damaged: one was stoned
 b a pro-Aristide mob and another was battered by soldiers and armed civilians.
 1CM personnel were followed and intimidated by army enlisted men in the
 Artibonite Valley and in the Central Plateau, two areas known for strong pro-
 Aristide sympathies and repressive local military commands, but no ICM personnel
 were harmed. ICM personnel were temporarily evacuated to the Dominican Republic
 in October because of concern for their personal safety during heightened political
 tension over implementation of the Governors Island accords. At the end of the year,
 ICM personnel had not yet returned but were expected to begin returning by the
 end of January 1994.
 Representatives of international human rights organizations visited Haiti regu-
 larly. These groups also faced threats and harassment, but their high profile per-
 mitted them to operate relatively freely. In August the Inter-American Commission
 on Human Rights visited to ather information on the human rights situation. The
 U.N. Special Rapporteur on Haiti was part of that delegation.
 Section 5. Discrimination based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Officially, there is no discrimination against women. While the 1987
 Constitution does not specificaly prohibit discrimination against women, it does es-
 tablish fundamental rights for "all citizens." Women have occupied prominent posi-
 tions in both the public and private sectors in recent years. In some social strata,
 however, women's roles have been limited by tradition. Peasant women remain
 largely in the traditional occupations of farming, marketing, and domestic tasks. Vi-
 olence against women is known to occur with some frequency, but, because of soci-
 etal traditions, it is generally not reported to police authorities.
 Although women are traditionally often the breadwinners for rural and urban
 poor families, they do not enjoy the same economic and social status as men. Knowl-
 edgeable local authorities report that both domestic violence and rape are common
 but are rarely reported or prosecuted. Existing laws and penalties against these
 crimes would be adequate were they enforced.
 Children.-The practice of forced domestic labor by children, called "restavek" in
 Haitian creole, continued unabated during 1993. An estimated 109,000 restavek
 children were cited in a 1991 U.N. study as an example of slavery practiced in the
 20th century. Young children from rural families are "adopted" and "educated" by
 more affluent city dwellers to serve as unpaid domestic labor. The children are com-
 pelled to work long hours, receive poor nourishment, little or no education, and are
 frequently beaten and sexually abused. Most of Port-au-Prince'slarge population of
 street children are runaway restaveks, and child prostitution rings are alleged to
 purchase restavek children from their "adoptive families." Local human rights
 groups do not regard the plight of restavek children as a priority and do not report
 on abuses of children or actively seek to improve their situation.
 Only 2 percent of the Health Ministry budget was devoted to health programs
 such as immunization and oral rehydration which serve children. However, humani-
 tarian assistance to Haiti is specifically targeted at the most vulnerable groups of
 the population. It is probable that infant and child mortality has deteriorated over
 the last year given the general long-term decline in social and economic conditions
 in Haiti-a decline that began before the September 1991 coup. In the absence of
 thorough survey data, it is impossible to determine the magnitude of such a decline.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Some 95 percent of Haitians are descend-
 ants of African slaves who won their war of independence from France in 1804.
 Most others are mulatto or of European, Middle Eastern, North American, or Latin
 American origin. Haitian law makes no distinctions based on race. There are long-
 standing social and political animosities among these various groups, however,
 many of which date back before Haiti's revolutionary period.
 
 
 There are two official languages: Creole, which is spoken by virtually all Haitians,
 and French, which is spoken by about 20 percent of the population. Those unable
 to read, write, and speak French are limited in their political and economic activi-
 ties. Many argue that the country's French-speaking elite have used language re-
 quirements as a barrier to the advancement of the country's Creole-speaking major-
 ity.
 People with Disabilities.-There is no overt ill-treatment of people with disabil-
 ities, but given the desperate poverty in which the vast majority of Haitians live,
 those with disabilities face a particularly harsh existence. There are no laws man-
 dating provision of access for people with disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the Labor Code guarantee the
 right of association. Workers, including those in the public sector, are specifically
 granted the right to form and join unions without prior government authorization.
 A union, which must have a minimum of 10 members, is required to register with
 the Ministry of Social Affairs within 60 days of its establishment. Union member-
 ship, marginal before the coup and even more so now, is estimated at 1 percent of
 the total labor force. The influence and effectiveness of organized labor has been se-
 verely limited and eroded as a result of political repression and economic break-
 down. There are five principal labor federations: the Autonomous Central of Haitian
 Workers, the National Con federation of Haitian Teachers, the Federation of Union-
 ized Workers, the Confederation of Haitian Workers, and the Independent General
 Organization of Haitian Workers. Each of these organizations maintains some affili-
 ation with various international labor organizations.
 The military continued to employ widespread repression and violence against
 trade union activities. Many union leaders closed their offices and went into hiding.
 Three union leaders were arrested and severely beaten by police in April. Unions,
 as well as all other citizen groups or assemblies, may meet only with the express
 written permission of the military. The military forced established unions of tele-
 phone electrical, and journalism workers either to change or completely replace
 their feadership. The military also intimidated leaders of rural agricultural unions
 and peasant cooperatives by arrests, beatings, and banning of meetings.
 Tripartite negotiations (labor, management, and government) begun in 1986 to re-
 vise the Labor Code were concluded in 1992. The revised Labor Code has not yet
 been approved by Parliament. The revised Code recognizes the right to strike but
 restricts the duration of certain types of strikes, as did the previous Code. The Code
 also stipulates that the Ministry of Social Affairs must recognize workers' right to
 strike in each case before a strike is legal. There were several attempts at major
 public or private sector strikes in 1993, but they were not widely observed, owing
 to the atmosphere of severe repression that followed the coup, as well as the eco-
 nomic impact of the U.NJOAS embargo.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Trade union organizing ac-
 tivities are protected by the Labor Code, and those who interfere with this right
 may be fined. Employers, including export firms, however, still routinely attempted
 to prevent workers from organizing labor unions, and government enforcement re-
 mained mostly ineffective. While union activities were curtailed by the de facto au-
 thorities, job loss as a result of economic conditions had a far more damaging impact
 on union activities. Prior to the coup, organized labor activity was generally con-
 centrated in the Port-au-Prince area, primarily in a large private sugar factory, in
 the assembly sector, and in state enterprises, all three of which suffered drastic job
 losses following the coup. The Haitian-American Sugar Company, which alone em-
 ployed 7,000 unionized workers, has been closed for more than a year. State enter-
 prises also suffered large job losses as the state-run flour mill, daily newspaper, and
 cement factory shut down.
 Collective bargaining, which has never been widespread in Haiti, was nonexistent
 in 1993. Wages are generally set unilaterally by employers.
 While Haiti has no export processing zones, prior to the OAS trade embargo it
 did have a sizable expworiented assembly sector. The Haitian Labor Code does not
 distinguish between industries producing for the local market and those producing
 for export. Many assembly sector companies were the focus of developmental efforts;
 they received greater outside scrutiny and were consequently somewhat more gener-
 ous with benefits such as on-site medical care vitamin supplements, interest-free
 loans, and subsidized meals than domestically oriented produers. In addition
 wages in the assembly sector are generally above the official minimum wage. Total
 employment in the export assembly sector declined by about 75 percent, correspond-
 ing to an estimated 25,000 to 30,000 jobs. As the assembly sector contracted, unions
 that were particularly strong in this sector declined accordingly.

 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, but enforcement of these provisions is practically nonexistent.
 Children continued to be subjected to forced domestic labor (see Section 5).
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum employment age for
 minors in all sectors is 15 years. Fierce adult competition for jobs ensures that child
 labor is not a factor in the industrial sector. Children under 15 commonly work at
 odd jobs in both rural and urban settings to supplement family income. Enforcement
 of child labor laws is the responsibility of the Ministry of Social Affairs but has been
 criticized by the International Labor Organization as inadequate.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage is set by law. A few weeks
 before the September 1991 coup, Parliament set a new minimum wage of about
 $2.15 (26 gourdes) per day for workers in the industrial sector. Although technically
 it became law before the coup, the legislation was never published in the official ga-
 zette; nevertheless, companies in the assembly sector have already adopted it. Even
 if it were widely applied in the private sector, the revised minimum wage would not
 provide a worker and family with a decent living. The minimum wage law applies
 also to agricultural workers but is not enforced.  us the majority of Haitians, who
 work in the agricultural sector, must survive on considerably less than the mini-
 mum wage.
 The Labor Code governs individual employment contracts. The Code sets the nor-
 mal workday at 8 hours and the workweek at 48 hours, with 24 hours of rest on
 Sunday. It also establishes minimum health and safety regulations. These laws and
 regulations are somewhat better observed in the industrial sector, which is con-
 centrated in the Port-au-Prince area and is more accessible to outside scrutiny.
 However, official enforcement, which is the responsibility of the Ministry of Social
 Affairs, has been lax. Labor Code provisions on health and safety are not enforced.
 With more than 50 percent of the population unemployed, workers are not able to
 exercise the right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without
 jeopardy to continued employment.
