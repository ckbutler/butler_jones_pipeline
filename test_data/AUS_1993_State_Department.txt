 AUSTRALIA
 Australia has a federal system of government and a long history as a multiparty
 parliamentary democracy. Federal, state, and local police carry out their functions
 in accordance with the requirements of the law, which respects and safeguards indi-
 vidual human rights.
 Australia has a developed economy, which includes manufacturing, mining, agri-
 culture, and services, providing most Australians with a high per capita income. A
 wide range of government programs offer assistance for the minority of relatively
 disadvantaged citizens, but fiscal constraints are affecting the amount made avail-
 able. People are free to hold private property, pursue economic and personal inter-
 ests, associate with others, and organize trade unions.
 Basic human rights are ensured by law and respected in practice. The Govern-
 ment is firmly committed, both domestically and internationally, to the promotion
 of, and respect for, human rights.
 In part as a result of the April 1991 report of the Royal Commission, which inves-
 tigated the deaths of Aboriginals while in custody, the Government administers
 many programs aimed at improving the socioeconomic conditions of Aboriginals and
 Torres Strait Islanders (ATSI), who together form about 1.6 percent of the popu-
 lation, and addressing longstanding discrimination against them.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Killing for political motives by the
 Government or bypolitical organizations does not occur.
 The April 1991 Report of the Royal Commission investigating the deaths of ATSI
 in custody stated that, although the deaths were not caused deliberately, police and
 prison officials showed callous indifference and remarkable insensitivity, which con-
 tributed significantly to the deaths. The Commission also found that although ATSI
 died at approximately the same rate as others in prison, ATSI persons were ar-
 rested at a rate 29 times that of whites.
 In a report issued in August, the Australian Institute of Criminology stated that
 deaths among the overall population in custody have not fallen in the period since
 the Royal Commission completed its work. The Institute noted that during the last
 2 years, the overall number of deaths had been essentially constant: 61 in 1991 and
 62 in 1992.
 In contrast, however, Aboriginal deaths in custody were reported to have fallen
 from 11 in 1991 (18.0 percent) to 7 in 1992 (11.3 percent). Further, the rate of
 deaths per 1,000 persons in custody was significantly lower for Aboriginals than for
 others--a notable improvement over previous data attesting to a somewhat higher
 rate of deaths among Aboriginal prisoners.
 b. Disappearance.-There have been no instances of political disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Australian law prohibits all these practices, and this prohibition is generally re-
 spected. In April 1991, however, the Royal Commission investigating ATSI deaths
 in custody indicated it had found credible evidence that ATSI had frequently been
 mistreated while in custody, and it recommended several steps to reduce the num-
 ber of arrests and improve the treatment of ATSI prisoners to avoid further deaths.
 During 1993 federal and state authorities continued to address the problem of
 deaths and mistreatment of Aboriginals in custody by means of police reform, in-
 cluding improved detention procedures and training courses in Aboriginal culture.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Australian law prohibits arbitrary arrest
 and imprisonment. This prohibition is respected in practice.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-Australia's well-developed system of federal and
 state courts is fully independent. Both in law and in practice, defendants receive
 due process, including a presumption of innocence, a right to confront witnesses,
 and a right of appeal. On the other hand, previous practice in federal and state
 cases has not always required that the Government pay for an indigent defendant's
 lawyer.
 All Australian states except New South Wales have obliged people involved in
 criminal cases to meet a merit test before qualifying for legal aid. The purpose of
 the merit test is to save the Government from "wasting funds on unwinnable cases."
 Under these procedures, many, but not all, defendants in serious criminal cases
 have been found to deserve legal counsel. If the case was considered futile, the de-
 fendant was denied counsel at public expense. An unfavorable decision could be ap-
 pealed to a panel of independent lawyers and social workers appointed by the Legal
 Aid Commission.
 The High Court has stated that it would be an exceptional case in which a person
 accused or serious charges could be tried fairly without a lawyer. In 1993 the State
 of Victoria took account of this decision by abolishing a previous restriction whereby
 counsel would not be provided if the cost was thought likely to exceed a specified
 amount, which at the end of 1993 equated to about $130,000.
 Defendants, including ATSI, appearing before an Australian Defense Force mag-
 istrate in cases subject to military jurisdiction, are exempt from the merit test. The
 Government maintains offices of special legal counsel for persons of ATSI descent,
 who are always entitled to receive legal aid.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 Australian law and in practice, no search may be conducted without a judicially is-
 sued warrant. The Government does not interfere with the privacy of family, home,
 or correspondence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-A democratic political system, an effective judi-
 ciary, and diverse, vigorous, and independent news media combine to protect free-
 dom of speech and press and full academic freedom. But Australia does not have
 a bill of rights, and journalists are sometimes subjected to court proceedings aimed
 at compelling them to reveal confidential sources. In May a South Australian jour-
 nalist was fined about $3,200 for refusing to reveal sources for a published report
 alleging that criminal behavior was involved in financial losses by the State Bank
 of South Australia. In September a New South Wales journalist received a 2-month
 suspended sentence for refusing to reveal sources for an article on police corruption.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Australia does not have a writ-
 ten Bill of Rights but is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political
 Rights, which provides for freedom of assembly and expression; these freedoms are
 respected in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Australians have complete freedom of religion. A provi-
 sion in the Constitution precludes the adoption of an official state religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Australia imposes no restrictions on movement within or outside the
 country. The rights of emigration and repatriation are also protected.
 The Government removes from Australia boat people whose applications for asy-
 lum or humanitarian admission are denied. In late 1992, the Australian High Court
 upheld the Government's right to detain boat people pending adjudication of their
 cases. As of September 30, 1993, Australian authorities had granted refugee status
 to 141 boat people, including 8 children born in Australia, out of some 540 applica-
 tions from persons who had arrived since 1989, primarily from Cambodia, China,
 and Vietnam. Two hundred forty-one boat people were still being held in various
 detention camps, pending court decisions.
 In an August 13 submission to Parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Mi a-
 tion, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs stated, "It is of concern that
 some unauthorized arrivals have been held in detention for very long periods: in
 some cases for more than 3  years." The Attorney General's Department addressed
 this same point in its own submission to the Joint Standing Committee, noting the
 requirement of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that deten-
 tion not be excessively long. At the request of the Joint Standing Committee, the
 Canberra office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) also submit-
 ted comments, indicating that detentions were unduly prolonged in some cases and
 possibly contravened Article 31 (1) of the 1951 Convention  elating to the Status
 of Refugees.
 The status of 19,000 Chinese, who had been students in Australia at the time of
 the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, and their 9,500 dependents, was regularized
 
 
 579
 in November 1993 when the Australian Government granted them permanent resi-
 dent status. Prior to the regularization of their status, they had received a clear
 commitment that none would be returned to China against their will, unless they
 broke the law. They had also been given prvisional status through the granting of
 temporary residence permits valid for 4 years.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Australians elect representatives to a two-chamber Federal Parliament as well as
 to numerous state and local bodies through free and open elections. Voting, by se-
 cret ballot, is compulsory in general elections for Australians 18 years of age and
 older; voters who do not at least collect ballots may be fined, and fines are in fact
 levied.
 Indigenous people are able to participate fully in Australia's political processes.
 They do so as voters, members of political parties, and candidates for elected office.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide range of local nongovernmental organizations concerned with human
 rights operates freely, and the Government permits unimpeded access to all inter-
 national ,rups investigating alleged human rights violations. Australia actively
 promotes human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Analysts and commentators state that violence in the home, mainly car-
 ried out by men against women, has enormous social and economic costs. Previous
 estimates suggested that domestic violence may affect as many as one Australian
 family in three or four, but government officials stress the impossibility of providing
 an accurate national profile of the number of women who are victims of domestic
 violence, because of underreporting and the lack of an agreed method for collecting
 statistics.
 The Government continued its community education campaign aimed at ending
 violence against women, operating under a 3-year budget of about $2.3 million. The
 National Committee on Violence Against Women produced a national strategy fo-
 cused on the role of all levels of government in eliminating violence against women;
 it was endorsed by ministerial councils consisting of federal and state ministers with
 similar responsibilities.
 The Sex Discrimination Act of 1984 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex,
 marital status, or pregnancy, and in late 1992 Parliament enacted amendments
 which significantly strengthened it. Separate 1986 legislation on affirmative action
 obliges employers to provide equal employment and equal promotion opportunities
 for female employees.
 Because of widespread concern about perceived bias against women in the legal
 system, the Australian Law Reform Commission initiated an inquiry into the equal-
 ity of women before the law. Women's rights and welfare are promoted by commu-
 nlty-based women's organizations, women's advisers in each of the states, and by
 the Government's Office of the Status of Women.
 Children.-The National Child Protection Council, a Commonwealth-funded body
 which also includes representatives of state governments as well as community
 members, promotes and conducts research on the prevention of child abuse and
 child neglect. The Council is examining the feasibility of a National Community
 Education Program, and it actively cooperates with nongovernmental organizations.
 In September the Government issued a national strategy aimed at preventing
 child abuse and creating an environment which supports families and communities
 and helps them meet their rsponsibilities to care for and protect children.
 In a reprt made public later in that same month, a senior judge of the Family
 Court of Astralia strongly criticized the State of Victoria's plan to reduce funding
 for child protection services by $5 million. Adverse findings included charges that
 the Children's Court was threatened by primitive conditions, overcrowding, over-
 work, and a lack of resources; that insuficient resources were being allocated for
 the introduction of mandatory reporting of child abuse; and that the state govern-
 ment had "virtually abandoned the care and protection" of homeless adolescents.
 Indigenous People.-The Racial Discrimination Act of 1975 prohibits discrimina-
 tion on grounds of race, color, descent, or national or ethnic origin, and most Aus-
 tralians have equal access to government services. In practice, however, ATSI con-
 tinued to suffer abusive treatment and widespread discrimination. As a remedial
 measure, on both the federal and state level, police training now includes more em-
 phasis on race sensitivity.
 
 
 580
 Because the Aboriginal population is the most disadvantaged group in relation to
 education, housing, health, and employment the federal and state governments pro-
 vide special services which supplement the broad range of programs that are avail-
 able to all Australians. These special services are aimed at improving socioeconomic
 conditions among ATSI.
 Parliament established the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission to
 give ATSI more control over many government programs intended for their benefit
 and also set up the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, which is coordinating a
 10-year progam to promote better understanding between ATSI and other Aus-
 tralians. In September the State of Western Australia announced a plan aimed at
 quadrupling the number of Aboriginal police officers over a 5-year period.
 Observers affiliated with Aboriginal groups generally supported federal and state
 programs but tended to describe them as underfunded. Further, they noted that
 much of the underlying problem of racial discrimination stemmed from deeply root-
 ed personal attitudes and views, expressing doubt that government programs, al-
 though valuable in themselves, will produce notable results in the short run. In ad-
 dition, these observers questioned whether federal and state police authorities had
 shown sufficient diligence and energy in pursuing police reform.
 Spokespersons for Aboriginal groups also stressed the need for appropriate and
 nondiscriminatory legislation that would assist in resolving property disputes in-
 volving Aboriginal groups who claimed traditional ownership of land as a matter of
 native title under common law. In their view, it would not be sufficient for federal
 and state governments to guarantee existing titles and award financial compensa-
 tion to Aboriginal groups whose interests might have been adversely affected by the
 Crown's past land grants (e.g., freehold title, pastoral leases, mining leases). In-
 stead, they asserted, the principles of justice and nondiscriminatory treatment re-
 quired that Aboriginal groups be entitled to recover actual ownership as a result of
 lawsuits that met criteria (e.g., ongoing and uninterrupted access to and use of the
 land) established by the High Court in its landmark Mabo Decision (1992), which,
 in part, had been based on provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act.
 The Government continued its commitment to promote intercultural understand-
 ing and to address better the needs of ethnic groups through a national
 multicultural agenda.
 People with Disabilities.-The Federal Disability Discrimination Act (1992) com-
 plements state laws prohibiting discrimination. It is administered by the Human
 Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, a Commonwealth body whose first Dis-
 ability Discrimination Commissioner was appointed in February. Federal officials
 are currently developing a national disability strategy based on the U.N. Standard
 Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities. Ensuring
 access to public buildings is required by the Disability Discrimination Act and, in
 part, is addressed in building codes. Australian authorities are investigating ways
 to improve compliance in practice.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Australian law and practice provide workers, includ-
 ing public servants, freedom of association both domestically and internationally.
 According to figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) in 1993,
 39.6 percent of the work force is unionized. Unions are closely aligned with the Aus-
 tralian Labor Party (ALP), and supply 60 percent of the voting delegates at ALP
 congresses. However, the Labor Government does not influence union policies, which
 are often at variance with its own, despite the fact that several key ministers were
 once trade union officials.
 In response to a November 1992 finding by the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) that the legal requirement for unions to have at least 10,000 workers in order
 to be registered under the federal system could "unduly influence workers' free
 choice of unions," the Government repealed this rovision on December 16, 1993,
 with amendments (effective March 1994) to the Industrial Relations Act of 1988.
 Inter alia, these amendments extended enterprise bargaining to the nonunionized
 sector and created a labor court to adjudicate secondary boycott and good-faith bar-
 gaining questions.
 Australian workers enjoy the right to strike, which is well established in practice.
 This right had not been protected under domestic law. However, the Government
 included explicit recognition of the right to strike in the December 16, 1993, legisla-
 tion. In general, industrial disputes are resolved through direct employer-union ne-
 gotiations or under the auspices of the various state and federal industrial relations
 commissions whose mandates include compulsory conciliation and arbitration.
 According to ABS figures released on December 20, 1993, in the 12 months ending
 September 1993, there were 631 reported disputes involving 1,065,100 persons and
 
 
 581
 1,165,800 working days lost. The number of disputes is the lowest on record in a
 12-month period since the ABS series was first compiled in December 1981, and rep-
 resents a 50-year low according to other available statistics. On a proportional basis
 (working days lost per thousand employees), the coal mining industry experienced
 the greatest number of labor disputes. Overall, there were no significant strikes in
 1993.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Australian workers are grant-
 ed the right, by law and in practice, to organize and bargain collectively, and to be
 represented in negotiating the prevention and settlement of disputes with employ-
 ers. Workers are also protected by law and in practice from antiunion discrimina-
 tion. The Government enhanced existing protection against unfair dismissal in its
 December 16, 1993, legislation, along lines specified in ILO guidelines.
 A pattern of centralized minimum wage awards and quasi-judicial arbitration,
 supplemented by industrywide or company-by-company collective bargaining, has
 gererally prevailed since 1904, when the  ommonwealth Conciliation and Arbitra-
 tion Commission was established. The Industrial Relations Act of 1988 made tech-
 nical changes in the system, creating a new Industrial Relations Commission which
 focuses more on its quasi-judicial dispute settlement role. At the same time, the
 Government has encouraged the spread of decentralized enterprise collective bar-
 gaining, in order to relate wage increases more to gains in productivity.
 In November 1992, the newly elected Conservative Government in the State of
 Victoria introduced a series of laws which, the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions alleged, forced 800,000 workers to sign individual employment con-
 tracts as opposed to collective agreements and outlawed almost all strikes and lim-
 ited pickets. Following a strike and protest demonstrations, the Federal Government
 acted to incorporate most if not all, of these workers under the federal Industrial
 Relations Law to protect their trade union rights.
 Export processing zones (EPZ's) do not exist in Australia.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Although there are no laws re-
 garding forced labor, Australia fully respects the ILO's conventions concerning
 forced labor, and forced labor is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-There is no federally mandated
 minimum age for employment, but state-imposed compulsory education require-
 ments, monitored and enforced by state educational authorities, prevent children
 from joining the work force until they are 15 to 16 years old, except in individual
 cases involving administrative approval for absence from school because of reasons
 such as illness, disability, or family hardship. In addition, federal and state min-
 istries of labor monitor and enforce a complicated network of legislation (which var-
 ies from state to state) governing such interrelated factors as minimum school-leav-
 ing age, minimum age to claim unemployment benefits, and minimum age to engage
 in specified occupations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Australia has long had a tradition that work-
 ers should be guaranteed a decent standard of living. The degree of wage com-
 parability for women is one of the highest in the world, and pay equity was enacted
 in legislation passed on December 16, 1993. Although a formal minimum wage ex-
 ists, it is not used. Instead, most workers are covered by differing minimum wage
 rates for individual trades and professions, as embodied in a comprehensive system
 of "awards" determined by the various quasi-judicial state and federal industrial re-
 lations commissions, after submissions by union employer, and government rep-
 resentatives. In many cases involving individual business enterprises, the commis-
 sions approve wage rates previously negotiated and agreed upon by employers and
 unions. Where market conditions warrant employees are often paid higher wages
 than those provided for in industrial awards (over-award payments'). About 80 per-
 cent of wage and salary earners are covered by awards. The remaining 20 percent
 are mostly management-level employees or are self-employed. There are no trades
 whose awards are below the formal minimum wage.
 The lowest current federal award of about US$221 (A$328) per 38-hour week is
 for clothing workers. Combined with other regularly provided benefits and govern-
 ment entitlements for low-income families, this wage provides a decent standard of
 living for a worker and his family. Real monetary wages for the average worker de-
 clined over the past decade, but a comprehensive social welfare program maintained
 a social safety net under lower paid workers.
 The majority of workers are employees of incorporated organizations. For them,
 a complex body of federal and state regulations, as well as decisions of the cor-
 responding industrial relations commissions, prescribes a 40-hour or shorter work-
 week, paid vacations, sick leave, and other benefits, including at least one 24-hour
 rest period. In a limited number of cases, workplace health and safety standards
 are also prescribed. Federal or State safety laws apply to every workplace.
 
 
 582
 An intergovernmental body called the National Occupational Health and Safety
 Commission (also known as "Worksafe Australia") develops advisory standards and
 codes of practice which can be a basis for new laws. The Occupational Health and
 Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act of 1991 gives a federal employee the legal
 right to cease work if he or she believes that particular work activities pose an im-
 mediate threat to health or safety. Most states and territories have laws that grant
 similar rights to their employees. At a minimum, private sector employees have re-
 course to state health and safety commissions, which will investigate complaints
 and enjoin remedial action as appropriate. Some states and territories also have leg-
 islation empowering trained private sector workers (in firms with more than 10 em-
 ployees) to suspend any activity they deem unsafe.
