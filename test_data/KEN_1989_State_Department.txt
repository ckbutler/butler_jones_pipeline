 KENiYA
 -Kenya has had an elected civilian government since
 independence in 1963. It has been a de facto one-party state
 almost since independence and a de jure one-party state since
 1982. President Daniel T. arap Moi maintains firm control
 over both the Government and the party, the Kenyan African
 National Union (KANU). KANU membership is a prerequisite for
 participation in national political affairs. The popularly
 elected National Assembly (unicameral Parliament) of 202
 members (including 12 appointed by the President and 2 ex
 officio members) has little independent power in national
 political affairs, but it is usually involved in local and
 regional issues or in affirming the President's initiatives.
 The Kehyan armed forces constitute a small professional
 establishment with a total strength of 22,500 members. Kenya
 has an internal security apparatus that includes the police
 criminal investigation department (CID), the paramilitary
 general services unit (GSU), and the directorate of security
 and intelligence (DSI or Special Branch). The CID and Special
 Branch investigate criminal activity and are also used to
 'monitor-persons whom the State considers subversive.
 Kenya's modern, market-oriented economy includes a
 well-developed private sector for trade and light
 manufacturing as well as an agricultural sector that provides
 food for local consumption and substantial exports of coffee,
 tea, and other commodities. Kenya's well-developed tourism
 industry has surpassed coffee and tea as the top foreign
 exchange earner. In 1989 a continued decline in world coffee
 prices exacerbated a balance of payments problem. Although
 economic growth continued, a persistently high population
 growth rate contributed to a serious and growing problem of
 unemployment. Kenyans are free to engage in private economic
 activity and own property without government interference.
 Human rights continue to be significantly restricted in Kenya,
 and in 1989 there was further erosion in the respect for civil
 liberties and political rights. With forced deportations, the
 environment for refugees worsened in 1989. By-elections were
 marked by government interference in support of particular
 candidatesand, in some cases, violence. In addition, the
 Government banned two magazines, and Parliament barred the
 largest English-language daily from covering legislative
 affairs for a 4-month period. A number of persons were
 charged with behaving "in a manner likely to cause a breach of
 the peace," often in connection with making statements
 critical of the Government or of political figures. There
 were new charges of police brutality and also growing signs of
 executive manipulation of the judicial system. In early June,
 the Government released the seven political detainees held
 under the Preservation of Public Security Act which allows
 indefinite detention without charge or trial in national
 security cases. Eight persons were publicly tried and
 convicted on security charges (9 in 1988, and 39 in 1987).
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no political killings in 1989. However, deaths of
 suspects in police custody in suspicious circumstances
 
 
 160
 KENYA
 continued to occur, including the death of former Nairobi
 student leader Titus Adungosi. The press reported that
 Adungosi died in Kenyatta hospital of a stomach ailment while
 serving a 10-year jail term for his complicity in the 1982
 coup attempt.
 Several deaths of prisoners held on other than security
 charges occurred during 1989. The Government generally
 conducts inquests into deaths in custody, though inquest
 results are not often made public. In February four of the
 five CID officers charged in connection with the 1988 death in
 Mombasa police custody of Zairian musician Taabu Kotela
 Kiombwe were found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to 5
 years each. In September the State agreed to pay Kiombwe's
 family damages in an out-of-court settlement.
 By the end of 1989, no officials had been held responsible for
 the 1986-87 deaths in custody of two persons allegedly
 involved in the underground movement Mwakenya.
 Human rights activists have also commented that over the past
 several years numerous suspects have been fatally shot by the
 police, allegedly while fleeing.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically related disappearances in
 1989.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, and Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is proscribed under the Kenyan Constitution. However,
 torture and police brutality remained an important issue in
 1989. While in 1989 there were markedly fewer public
 allegations of torture and abuse by persons held on
 political/security charges than in recent years, a number of
 Kenyans told the press they were physically abused by the
 police. Professor Maina wa Kinyatti, who was released from
 jail in 1988, told the U.S. press after fleeing Kenya that
 "people are still being put in water while in detention," (see
 Section l.d.). President Moi and senior government officials
 publicly condemned police brutality and torture, and some
 police officials were convicted of human rights abuses in 1989.
 Prison conditions in Kenya are poor and sometimes dangerous to
 life and health. Detainees and prisoners have complained of
 beatings, poor food, corruption, and inadequate facilities and
 medical care. Prisoners often must sleep on cement floors.
 Overcrowding persisted in 19a9 and contributed to the rapid
 spread of meningitis among prisoners. In August the director
 of medical services said at least 20 inmates at Kodiaga
 maximum security prison and 12 inmates at Bungoma prison died
 of meningitis. The Government later provided inoculations for
 prisoners. In a directive aimed at reducing prison
 overpopulation, President Moi released 10,274 petty criminals
 in October on the llth anniversary of his presidency.
 The Preservation of Public Security Act (PPSA) allows for
 solitary confinement in security-related cases, with no
 contact with family or legal counsel, although in some cases
 lawyers and families have been permitted to visit detainees.
 Correspondence with prisoners is monitored and occasionally
 not delivered. Prisoners held on other than security grounds
 are allowed one brief visit per month by family members.
 
 
 161
 Prison or security officers are usually present during visits
 by family members or lawyers.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that most arrested or detained
 persons shall be brought before a court "as soon as is
 reasonably practicable," and that if such person is not
 brought within 24 hours of his arrest or from the commencement
 of his detention the burden of explanation is on the
 authorities. The Constitutioh was amended in 1988 to allow
 the police to hold people suspected of capital offenses for 14
 days before being brought before a court. Capital offenses
 include such crimes as murder and treason. In practice,
 suspects of all types are often held incommunicado for long
 periods before being brought before a court.
 Kenya's PPSA allows the State to detain a person indefinitely
 without charges or trial. A formal detention order must be
 signed and publicly gazetted. There is no judicial review of
 the legality of detention. Detention cases are reviewed by a
 board appointed by the President which meets in camera every 6
 months, but'the Government is not bound by this board's
 recommendations. In 1989 there were no new detentions under
 this Act, and in June President Moi released all seven
 detainees previously held.
 In other cases, the number of which is difficult to gauge,
 people were held in police custody and questioned without
 being charged or officially detained under any specific
 authority. For example, in 1989 a former Member of Parliament
 was picked up by Nairobi police and questioned for 1 day. He
 was not charged or detained. Observers estimate that there
 are from four to eight people being held by Nairobi police in
 this fashion at any given time--some held for hours, some for
 days or even weeks.
 Traditionally, neither exile nor threat of exile has been used
 by the Government as a means of intimidation or punishment.
 In June, however, Nairobi businessman Idris Osman, an ethnic
 Somali, was deported to Ethiopia for alleged activities
 incompatible with national interests and state security.
 Although Osman held a Kenyan passport, Kenyan authorities
 claimed his passport had been issued in an illegal manner.
 Osman was deported despite a court order to airport and
 immigration officials enjoining such action. In December two
 other ethnic Somalis were deported under similar circumstances.
 A number of Kenyan dissidents have resorted to self-exile. In
 most cases, the exiles have not been formally charged with
 crimes. In April, fearing rearrest, historian and former
 university lecturer Maina wa Kinyatti fled to Tanzania and
 eventually emigrated to the United States. Kinyatti, who
 reported being beaten and otherwise mistreated in prison, had
 completed a 6-year jail term in October 1988 for possession of
 an allegedly seditious document. In June President Moi
 publicly announced a general amnesty and pardon to Kenyan
 dissidents abroad who were willing to return home. Two such
 exiles returned in 1989.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of fair Public Trial
 Kenya's legal system, as defined in the Judicature Act of
 1967, is based on the Kenyan Constitution, laws passed by
 
 
 162
 KEMA
 Parliament, and common law or court precedent. Customary law
 is used as a guide in civil matters affecting people of the
 same ethnic group so long as it does not conflict with
 statutory law. Kenya does not have the jury system. The
 court system consists of a Court of Appeals, a High Court, and
 two levels of magistrates' courts where most criminal and
 civil cases originate. Civilians are tried in civilian
 courts, and verdicts may be appealed to the Kenyan High Court
 and ultimately to the Court of Appeal. Kenyans do not have a
 right to legal counsel except in certain capital cases. Most
 persons tried for capital offenses are provided counsel free
 of charge if they cannot afford it. Military personnel are
 tried by military courts, and verdicts may be appealed.
 Attorneys for military personnel are appointed on a case by
 case basis by the Chief Justice.
 The President appoints the Chief Justice and appoints High
 Court judges with the advice of the judicial service
 commission. The President also appoints the Attorney
 General. His power over the judicial system has steadily
 increased through constitutional amendments adopted in 1986
 and 1988, one of which gave the Government greater control
 over the firing of judges. Among other things, these changes
 give the President authority to fire the Attorney General, the
 Auditor General, and Hig Court judges. Many observers in
 Kenya and abroad have described these amendments as
 undermining the independence of the judiciary.
 The constitutional right to a fair public trial has been
 circumscribed in many instances, notably in political/security
 cases such-as those involving alleged Mwakenya or Kenya
 Patriotic Front (KPF) members. In cases involving the PPSA,
 the courts have upheld the constitutionality of properly
 executed actions taken under the authority of that Act but
 have limited themselves to ensuring compliance with procedural
 provisions. In cases without political implications the right
 to a fair public trial is normally observed, although long
 delays and postponements are common.
 In 1989 there were 8 public convictions involving security
 charges. In the first public prosecution in 1989 involving
 membership in a subversive organization (in this case, the
 KPF), Zachary Kariuki Paul Mwati admitted in court to three
 charges of spying on Kenyan military installations, receiving
 money from self-exile Koigi wa Wamwere, and sending seditious
 documents to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).
 I4wati was held incommunicado before appearing in court. As in
 most security-related trials of previous years, his conviction
 was based on his "confession" that he was a KPF member.
 Unrepresented, Mwati was sentenced to 4 years.
 In March Joseph Andrew Kibagendi and James Ondari Omariba were
 given 9 months each after being tried and convicted of
 possession of a subversive document. Both men had legal
 representation. Also, in March Daniel John Mwangi Theuri was
 jailed for 20 months on his confession in court that he joined
 the KPF. He was unrepresented.
 In October Dixon Jowe Alieth, unrepresented by legal counsel,
 was sentenced to 6 years in jail for possessing seditious
 publications. Also in October, prison warden Wilson Awuor
 Angonga was jailed for 4 1/2 years for membership in the
 underground movement Mwakenya. Angonga, who also was not
 represented by a lawyer, was held-incommunicado for
 approximately 4 weeks before he pled guilty.
 
 
 163
 KENYA
 In November former primary school teacher Benjamin Andayi
 Muhehe was sentenced to 12 months in jail after confessing to
 a charge of leaving Kenya illegally to obtain military
 training from a clandestine movement. Muhehe was held
 incommunicado for more than a month. He, too, apparently was
 not represented by a lawyer. Also in November, former
 community development officer Stephen Mulili Kituu pled guilty
 and was sentenced to 4 years for membership in Mwakenya.
 Kituu, who had been held for 1 month before being sentenced,
 was apparently not represented by legal counsel.
 The draft version of the advocates bill which went before
 Parliament in December contained no requirement that lawyers
 obtain licenses. The Law Society of Kenya had argued
 vigorously against the 1988 Government proposal that lawyers
 be licensed. However, in December, the Kenyan press reported
 that KANU planned to affiliate the Law Society to the ruling
 party. The Law Society objected strongly to the proposed
 affiliation, and President Moi later said that KANU had no
 plans to merge the two organizations.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Searches without warrants are allowed under the Constitution
 in certain instances "to promote the public benefit,"
 including security cases. Security officials also conduct
 searches without warrants to apprehend suspected criminals or
 to seize property suspected to be stolen. Homes of suspected
 dissidents have been searched without warrants, as have the
 residences of foreign missionaries. Security forces
 reportedly employ a variety of surveillance techniques,
 including electronic surveillance and a network of informers.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of speech and
 press, the exercise of these rights is restricted. No
 criticism of the President is tolerated in any form. Kenya's
 sedition laws have been criticized in Kenya and abroad for
 failing to-distinguish between violent and nonviolent
 opposition to the Government. The threat of detentions and
 prosecutions have been used to restrict freedom of speech and
 press. For example, in April three Standard newspaper
 reporters were picked up by police on separate occasions in
 and around Embu, in apparent response to their coverage of a
 political controversy involving KANU and a local bishop.
 In 1989 there was an increasing pattern of arrests on charges
 of behaving in a manner "likely to cause a breach of the
 peace," often in connection with statements critical of the
 Government or government officials. For example, in June a
 man was jailed for 6 months for shouting in a bar that the
 Government "had failed to assist two self-exiles. In September
 a high school business teacher was jailed for 3 months for
 saying that the head of the civil service should "drop dead"
 as he was misadvising the President.
 Parliament rarely debates national issues such as foreign
 policy. Government and KANU action against outspoken
 politicians, clergymen, and lawyers, as well as the detention
 provisions of the PPSA and the 1988 amendment, discourage
 public exchange of views on political topics the Government
 
 
 164
 KENYA
 considers sensitive. Sharp government criticism of churchmen
 who opposed government policies continued in 1989 (see Section
 2.c.). At the end of the year, the leader of the Green Belt
 movement was heavily criticized by politicians and government
 officials for her criticism of the plan to construct a
 60-story building on open space in central Nairobi. The
 movement was evicted from its government-owned headquarters on
 1 day's notice (see also Section 5).
 The single television and all radio stations are owned and
 controlled by the Government. In June after the Daily Nation
 newspaper was barred by Parliament from covering house
 proceedings, the Voice of Kenya Press Review program dropped
 its coverage of Nation news stories, allegedly on State House
 instructions, for the 4-month period the Nation was barred.
 Previously the Press Review program had highlighted main
 articles in all three English-language dailies.
 Privately owned newspapers and journals are published in
 Kenya, and newspapers, magazines, and books from abroad are
 readily available. There is no systematic censorship of the
 press, although the press practices self-censorship and
 confines its commentary within usually understood but legally
 undefined limits. The press criticizes some government
 policies and occasionally government officials but never the
 President.
 At times the Government intervenes to tell editors how to
 handle sensitive stories. As former Assistant Minister in the
 now-defunct Ministry of National Guidance and Political
 Affairs Shariff Nassir commented, "although there is press
 freedom in Kenya, editors should not be left to write whatever
 they want." In December 1988, Financial Review editor Peter
 Kareithi was picked up from his office by plainclothes police,
 locked up for several hours, questioned, and then released.
 Later, in April 1989, this popular weekly news/economics
 publication was banned after it published controversial
 articles on the Government's economic policies. Financial
 Review Limited, publishers of the magazine, were also
 proscribed from publishing under any other trade name.
 In August the Government banned another magazine--the Nairobi
 monthly Development Agenda. The magazine, only two issues
 old, focused on the economy and current events. Unlike the
 negative publicity which preceded the banning of the Financial
 Review, the banning of Development Agenda occurred with no
 warning; no Kenyan, official or private, had publicly
 criticized the publication prior to its banning, and the
 Government made no effort to explain the banning or offer any
 justification for it.
 The most salient example of curbs on press freedom occurred in
 June when Parliament barred for 4 months the largest-
 circulation English newspaper, Daily Nation, from covering
 proceedings of the National Assembly. Parliamentary
 criticism, which appeared to be well-coordinated, echoed
 criticisms which had been made by the President several weeks
 earlier. Members of Parliament (all of whom belong to KANU)
 debated accusations against the paper's owners and editors,
 including biased, inaccurate, and critical reporting; foreign
 ownership (with a subtheme of encouraging foreign reporting
 against Kenya's interests) and an unduly high percentage of
 ethnic Kikuyu management.
 
 
 165
 In August, after a year of court delays, the Government
 conceded the appeal of Bedan Mbugua, former editor-in-chief of
 the proscribed Christian magazine Beyond (banned last year).
 Mbugua had been charged and convicted of failure to file
 annual financial returns. However, it was widely believed
 that the real reason for the banning was his publication of an
 article criticizing queue voting and KANU's conduct during the
 1988 elections. Mbugua had-served 14 days of his 9-month
 sentence before being ieleased on bail pending appeal. The
 judicial procedure followed in Mbugua's case was highly
 irregular. Rather than make a determination on the merits of
 the appeal, the deputy public prosecutor requested that the
 court set aside the conviction and sentence. Beyond magazine
 remained banned at the end of the 1989.
 More than 100 foreign journalists representing Western news
 organizations are based in Kenya. In 1989 the Government
 continued to criticize the foreign press for its coverage of
 Kenyan issues. Local reporters increasingly came under attack
 as well.
 While there are no legal restrictions on academic freedom,
 there are a number of de facto ones. The Government has
 employed students and professors to monitor classroom
 exchanges. Past detentions and trials of students and
 professors for alleged seditious activities have inhibited
 academic inquiry that might be construed as critical of the
 Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly, while provided for in the Constitution,
 is seriously limited by the Public Order and Police Act, which
 gives authorities power to control public gatherings, defined
 as meetings of three or more persons. It is illegal to
 convene an unlicensed meeting, and politicians have been
 arrested for violations of this Act. Although licenses to
 hold public meetings are rarely denied, Bishop David Gitari
 had difficulty obtaining permits to conduct fundraising
 meetings for his church. Bishop Okullu was roundly criticized
 by the Government for supporting the right of students to
 protest peacefully.
 Freedom of association is governed by the Societies Act which
 states that every association must be registered or exempted
 from registration by the registrar of societies. Some groups
 have had difficulty obtaining registration or have been
 deregistered. With the exception of civil servants, who are
 required to join KANU, Kenyans are not legally bound to join
 any political organization. Although the party and the
 Government emphasize that it is voluntary, KANU party
 membership is a prerequisite for voting and holding public
 office. No other political party is permitted.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Kenya has no state religion. Freedom of worship is
 acknowledged in the Constitution and generally allowed.
 Foreign missionaries of many denominations are permitted to
 work in Kenya, though on occasion the President and other
 officials have publicly questioned the motives of certain
 missionaries and accused them of interfering in politics.
 
 
 166
 KEN~YA
 Four American missionaries were deported in 1989. The four
 were affiliated with Associated Christian Churches of Kenya
 (ACCK), a U.S.-based missionary group which was deregistered
 in 1988. The Government maintained that the four missionaries
 were working in Kenya illegally.
 Churches new to Kenya must obtain government approval to be
 registered. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints
 has tried without success for 8 years to obtain registration.
 In 1987 the Jehovah's Witnesses were deregistered but
 continued to hold services under a stay order from the High
 Court.
 There is no religious requirement for voting or holding
 office. Clergymen in Kenya have spoken out on political as
 well as religious issues from their pulpits. In 1989 senior
 officials sharply criticized certain clergymen, including
 Anglican bishops Alexander Muge, Henry Okullu, David Gitari,
 and Presbyterian Church of East Africa Reverend Timothy Njoya
 for making political statements. In April, 30 armed thugs
 raided Bishop Gitari's home, and KANU youths disrupted a
 sermon given by the prelate. The attacks came after Gitari
 referred in a sermon to the blatant rigging of the February
 elections in Kiharu district. The results of a State
 House-commissioned police inquiry into the attack on Gitari's
 house, which allegedly found that the raid was organized by a
 local government official, were not made public. In August
 Reverend Timothy Njoya was summoned to appear before the Nyeri
 District security committee and questioned for nearly 4 hours.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Although most Kenyans can travel freely within the country,
 the Government has in the past used the PPSA to limit the
 movement of persons deemed to be dangerous to the public
 security. Persons traveling by road to sections of
 Northeastern Province are required, due to the prevalence of
 highway banditry in the area, to travel in convoys headed by
 Kenyan police.
 Kenya does not generally prohibit emigration of its citizens
 but on occasion does prevent travel abroad, usually by critics
 of the Government. In particular, it sometimes refuses to
 return passports or issue new ones to people detained under
 the PPSA for some time after they are released. The
 Government does not regard the issuance of passports to
 citizens as a right and reserves the authority to issue or
 deny passports at its discretion. In 1989 lawyers Gibson
 Kamau Kuria and Paul Muite were still unable to obtain their
 passports. Kuria, who had been jailed for 9 months in
 previous years after defending three political detainees, has
 been forbidden to leave Kenya since his arrest 2 years ago
 (see Section 4).
 During 1989 there was no known instance in which citizenship
 was revoked for political reasons. In the case of Idris
 Osman, an ethnic Somali, the Government alleged that he had
 obtained his Kenyan passport by illegal means (see Section
 l.d.). In December two additional ethnic Somali businessmen
 were deported under similar circumstances.
 In 1989 Kenya continued to accept some refugees for permanent
 resettlement, though its acceptance rate dropped from 90
 percent in 1988 to under 10 percent in the first half of 1989,
 
 
 167
 KENYA
 subsequently increasing to 50 percent for the rest of 1989.
 In 1989 the Kenyan Government stopped accepting virtually all
 Ugandans for permanent resettlement. On April 5, Kenyan
 officials entered a refugee camp outside Nairobi, rounded up
 238 Ugandan refugees, and forcibly returned them to Uganda.
 Although the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) protested the deportations, the Kenyan Government
 publicly maintained that the refugees had volunteered to
 return to Uganda.
 In September an estimated 3,000 Somalis fled into northeastern
 Kenya near the town of Liboi to escape fighting around the
 Somali border town of Doble. In late September, 60 Somali
 refugees were involuntarily returned to Somalia. During this
 time the Government refused to permit the UNHCR and the Kenyan
 Red Cross to travel or provide food to the Liboi area. In
 November the Government reversed its decision and decided to
 permit.the 4-NHCR and the Red Cross to travel to the area. By
 the end of the year unfavorable weather conditions, an
 impassable road, and a flooded airstrip prevented UNHCR travel
 to the border.
 In an effort to control the refugee presence.(around 12,000),
 the Government initiated a series of procedures which confined
 mandated refugees (i.e., refugees not accepted by Kenya and
 awaiting resettlement to a third country) to the Thika refugee
 camp. The Government also started limiting refugee cards to 2
 years' duration rather than giving iefugees indefinite or
 permanent resettlement.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The, Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens cannot change the system of government in Kenya or
 replace the party in power through the electoral process. The
 Constitution prohibits formation of any political party other
 than KANU, and President Moi and a small group of advisers
 control all major policy decisions within the Government and
 the party. Since 1964, when Kenya adopted a presidential
 system, the party's candidate for President has been
 unopposed. President Moi was reelected in 1988 to a third
 5-year term. Numerous candidates compete in party and
 parliamentary elections--also held every 5 years--but all
 candidates must be KANU members, and the national party
 headquarters has exclusive authority to approve candidates for
 political office.
 In 1988 KANU adopted a controversial queuing system for
 electing KANU nominees. It requires voters to line up in
 public behind photographs of the candidates. Only those
 voters who have KANU membership cards are permitted to
 participate in the nomination process. KANU members comprise
 at most 50 percent of the voting age population. Candidates
 who receive 70 percent of the vote in the queuing stage are
 automatically elected without having to contest the
 second-stage secret ballot election. In the 1988 elections,
 one-third of the candidates were elected in this manner.
 The public nature of the queuing process continues to raise
 obvious questions about voter intimidation. In the 1988
 elections none of the candidates known to be critical of
 government/party policies was elected. Allegations regarding
 the abuse of secret ballots continue as well. There were 24
 petitions filed contesting the results of the 1988 races. The
 High Court did not begin hearing the petitions until I year
 
 
 168
 KENYA
 after the elections: 10 were withdrawn by the petitioners, 11
 were dismissed by the High Court on technical grounds, and 3
 were won by the petitioners.
 KANU party branches, which often take their cues from State
 House, have the power to suspend or expel members from the
 party. There are no clear guidelines for activities requiring
 disciplinary action. Thus party officials wield significant
 power and can remove their political opponents from the
 party. Since party membership is required to hold public
 office, expulsion from KANU signifies political death, at
 least for the short term. Expelled officials may eventually
 be allowed back into the party but then are expected to adhere
 to party policies.
 In an extensive June 1989 KANU purge, 14 party members,
 including former Vice-President Josephat Karanja, several
 former cabinet ministers and 4 sitting Members of Parliament
 were expolled from the party, thereby precluding their
 participation in Kenyan politics. By-elections were held to
 fill six vacant parliamentary seats. In two constituencies,
 the voting was marred by violence and allegations of polling
 irregularities.  In two others, it was characterized by voter
 apathy and extremely low turnouts.
 The February by-election in Kiharu (necessitated by a
 resignation from Parliament in December) was perceived by many
 Kenyans as the most blatantly unfair of recent political
 contests. In that by-election G.M.K. Mweru was declared the
 winner (over Julius Kiano) with over 70 percent of the queue
 vote in the party election, although the press reported
 credible accounts which indicated that Mweru actually polled
 no more than 800 votes to Kiano's approximately 9,500. (Kiano
 was later named to head the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation.)
 Local KANU officials who spoke out against the election
 results later recanted after being threatened with expulsion
 from the party. Despite protests by local KANU party and
 church officials and petitions circulated among voters, the
 results in this election were sustained.
 The Sabatia seat left open by Moses Mudavadi's death was
 filled by Mudavadi's son, Musalia Mudavadi, without an
 election. KANU party officials exhorted voters to elect the
 young Mudavadi unopposed. The candidates who had voiced an
 interest in the seat backed out of the race, thereby paving
 the way for Mudavadi to take the seat without a contest.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government reacts negatively to criticism of its human
 rights record and discourages Kenyans from providing outside
 human rights groups with information. President Moi has
 publicly attacked Amnesty International and other groups for
 "meddling" in Kenya's internal affairs.
 In December 1988, two American lawyers from the Lawyers
 Committee on Human Rights sought and obtained high level
 appointments with government officials to discuss human rights
 concerns. In March a delegation from the Robert F. Kennedy
 Memorial Center visited Kenya to present lawyer Gibson Kamau
 Kuria with the RFK human rights award. The group met with
 President Moi and other high-ranking government officials and
 was able to move about freely in Kenya to speak to human
 
 
 169
 KENYA
 rights advocates. Although the presentation of the award was
 freely conducted before a large audience, the press conference
 given by Kerry Kennedy on their last day provoked a series of
 virulent anti-Kennedy parliamentary speeches and a week-long
 anti-Kennedy press campaign.
 Several Kenyan organizations, such as the Law Society of Kenya
 and churches, address issues related to human rights, but none
 focuses exclusively on human rights concerns. Kenya has not
 ratified the Organization of African Unity's Human and
 People's Rights Charter, adopted in 1981 in Nairobi.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Kenya is a diverse country that does not mandate legal
 discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, language
 or social status. However, in November the Government
 required all Kenyans of ethnic Somali origin to go through a
 screening program designed to weed out illegal Somali aliens,
 who, because the international border traverses areas
 traditionally inhabited by ethnic Somalis, are
 indistinguishable from Kenyan nationals of Somali origin. The
 Government stated the screening was triggered in part by
 security-related incidents (game park poaching and attacks on
 tourists) in areas accessible from Somalia. As part of this
 campaign the Government required Kenyan ethnic Somalis to
 carry an additional form of identification stating that they
 have proven themselves to be Kenyan citizens. They are the
 only ethnic-group in Kenya required to do so. Some ethnic
 Somalis have refused to participate as a matter of principle.
 The clergy, the Law Society of Kenya, and members of the
 ethnic Kenyan Somali community criticized the'screening
 process as discriminatory and illegal.
 Members of all ethnic groups may run for office, and ethnic
 representation at the minister and assistant minister level is
 broad. Twelve of Kenya's ethnic groups are represented in the
 Cabinet. Members of 18 indigenous ethnic groups and 1
 Caucasian hold positions at the assistant minister level.
 The Asian community, numbering about 65,000, accounts for a
 disproportionate share of the nation's economic wealth and
 output. The Government's policy of Africanization of the
 economy has resulted in some Asian emigration. Kenya amended
 its citizenship law in 1984, depriving some Asians and
 Europeans of citizenship. Under present law, persons born in
 Kenya of non-Kenyan.parents can no longer claim citizenship.
 There is no legal discrimination against women, but
 traditional culture and attitudes have long prescribed limited
 roles for women. For example, in responding to criticism of
 the Government by an environmental group (led by a female
 professor) President Moi in December stated that the African
 tradition is. for women to respect men. Women may own property
 and businesses. Women's roles are particularly restricted in
 rural areas where they account for 75 percent of the total
 agricultural work force.
 Polygamy is not legal for people married under the Christian
 Marriage Act, but it is permitted for those who marry under
 African customary law. Kenya's law of succession, which
 governs inheritance rights, provides for equal treatment of
 male and female children (in contrast to much customary law
 which favors the eldest male children).

 Violence agains women, especially wife beating, has emerged in
 Kenya as a fairly widespread and growing problem, according to
 many doctors. While there are legal remedies, police and
 judicial authorities are sometimes reluctant to intervene or
 prosecute husbands who physically abuse their wives. The
 Government has done little to address this issue beyond
 general support to women's organizations. In the case of
 female circumcision, which is still practiced by some Kenyan
 ethnic groups and is not illegal, the Government officially
 discourages the practice but leaves it to women's groups to
 actively oppose female circumcision through health education
 programs. In December President Moi publicly asked Kenyan
 communities which still circumcise women to stop the
 practice. Moi called female circumcision "outdated" and said
 it was "unacceptable in modern Kenya."
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Civil servants, who comprise 21 percent of total wage earners
 (and 41 percent of public sector wage earners) in Kenya, have
 been barred from forming or joining unions since President Moi
 deregistered their union in the early 19801s. Moreover, since
 1985 all civil servants have been required to be members of
 the ruling party, KANU. Other workers are, by law, free to
 form and join unions but, except for the Kenya National Union
 of Teachers (KNUT), all unions must belong to the single trade
 union confederation, The Central Organization of Trade Unions
 (COTU). KNUT is a separate organization that maintains
 "fraternal" relations with COTU. During 1989 the Government
 considered affiliating COTU to the ruling KANU party. In May
 1989 the Government decided that COTU and KANU should
 .cooperate" rather than be affiliated. The Government, COTU,
 and KANU agreed that there should be no interference by the
 party in the collective bargaining process.
 The Committee on Freedom of Association (CFA) of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) has discussed the ban
 on civil service trade unions for the last several years. In
 early 1989 the CFA expressed concern at the length of time the
 Government was taking to follow through on the implementation
 of "measures to permit the establishment of organizations
 through which the Kenyan civil servants will be able to pursue
 normal trade union activities" and asked for an update on the
 plans originally promised in 1987.
 The Government and KANU exercise considerable influence over
 COTU and through COTU the entire trade union movement. The
 President has the right to appoint or remove union leaders in
 COTU for the positions of the Secretary General, the Deputy
 Secretary General, and the Assistant Secretary General, though
 it should be noted that the President has not exercised this
 right and has permitted the unions to select COTU leaders.
 Union leaders are discouraged but not prohibited from holding
 political positions. Currently Sam Muhanji, the General
 Secretary of the Kenya Union of Food, Commercial, and Allied
 Workers (the largest union in Kenya) and W. Ndumbe, the
 General Secretary of the Local Government Workers Union are
 Members of Parliament.
 The only workers prohibited by law from striking are members
 of the armed forces, the police forces, the prison service,
 and the national youth service. Other workers have the right
 to.strike 21 days after a written report of the dispute is
 
 
 171
 submitted to the Minister of Labor. However, this right is
 limited by the broad power given the Minister by the Trade
 Disputes Act whereby the minister has the authority to require
 the two parties to go to the industrial court for mandatory
 arbitration of their differences. Public sector workers are
 not specifically prohibited from striking, but the Minister of
 Labor enjoys broad authorities to prohibit public sector
 strikes. In 1988 there were 92 strikes, mostly illegal
 wildcat work stoppages occurring at a local level over
 specific issues, often without permission from the national
 union and often without providing the Minister with written
 notification. The Government has not prosecuted trade
 unionists involved in these wildcat strikes unless criminal
 activity such as vandalism has taken place. The last public
 sector strikes in Kenya occurred in 1986 when there were two
 strikes involving 41 workers with 35 workdays lost.
 COTU is affiliated with the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity and maintains relations, though not affiliation,
 with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 (ICFTU). It sends observers to meetings of the ICFTU and the
 Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Collective bargaining is protected by law and is freely
 practiced throughout the country. The only government
 restriction on collective bargaining is that wage settlements
 not exceed 75 percent of the rate of inflation. Between 300
 and 400 collective bargaining agreements are registered with
 the Government every year and cover most of Kenya's
 nonagricultural wage sectors. Most public sector workers are
 covered by collective bargaining agreements but not the large
 numbers of civil servants (and some university professors
 defined as "management"). Although no statistics are
 available, it is estimated that over 50 percent of Kenya's
 wage workers fall under a collective bargaining agreement,
 though less than 20 percent are union members. Kenya does not
 permit closed shops, and unions have been complaining for
 years over the problem of "free riders." Although no export
 processing zones exist at the moment, the Government plans to
 open two in'the near future. No restrictions on worker rights
 are planned in these zones.
 The Government promotes voluntary negotiations between
 employers' and workers' organizations and encourages workers
 to join unions. Both in law and practice, union officials are
 protected against discrimination or penalties based on their
 union activities. There is an industrial court that would
 hear such complaints, although there have been none in recent
 years.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Under the Chief's Authority Act, a local authority can require
 the performiance of limited communal activities for the benefit
 of the local community. While this provision is rarely
 invoked, the ILO Committee of Experts has called on the
 Government to bring this Act into conformity with ILO Forced
 Labor Conventions (to which Kenya subscribes) and has noted
 that talks are continuing for the introduction of the
 necessary amendments. There are a number of provisions in
 other legislation (e.g., Penal Code, Public Order Act,
 Prohibited Publications Order, Merchant Shipping Act, and the
 
 
 172
 Trade Disputes Act) which the Committee has found to be
 inconsistent with the Conventions.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The legal minimum age for employment is 16. Employment and
 working conditions in some occupations are limited for those
 under 18. The minimum age regulations do not apply for
 agricultural employment, where many children work on family
 farms, or for domestic work. Although enforcement of child
 labor laws is lax, child labor is not a problem in the
 industrial sector or in dangerous occupations given Kenya's
 high unemployment rate. The Ministry of Labor has difficulty
 enforcing minimum age laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Over 80 percent of the Kenyan work force does not hold jobs in
 the wage sector and is not covered by minimum wage law. For
 those covered, there is a complicated minimum wage scheme
 which is divided by age, locale, and occupation. Currently
 the minimum wage (last revised June 1, 1989) ranges from
 $14.50 per month for a rural unskilled worker under age 18 to
 about $82 dollars per month for a cashier in Nairobi or
 Mombasa. Wage earners get additional benefits including a
 15-percent supplement for housing which is not included in the
 above minimum wages. A Nairobi wage earner making $50 per
 month would have a great deal of trouble providing for his
 family--which most likely is very large since Kenya has one of
 the highest birth rates in the world. Many families
 supplement a wage earner's salary by selling agricultural
 produce or by having additional family members in the work
 force.
 The standard legal workweek in Kenya as defined by the
 regulation of wages order is 52 hours over 6 days, except for
 night duty workers who can be employed for up to 60 hours per
 week. Agricultural workers are exempt from this order.
 Kenyan labor law requires weekly (not daily) rest periods,
 full payment for public holidays, 21 days of paid annual leave
 per year, sick leave (7 days of full pay and 7 additional days
 of half pay) and 2 months at full pay of maternity leave,
 though women using maternity leave lose their annual leave for
 that year. Observance of these regulations is mixed and the
 Ministry of Labor, which has the obligation to enforce them,
 acts on the basis of complaints, which are few.
 The Government does set health and safety standards for
 factories, the construction industry, and docks. However, the
 law does not cover the large agriculture work force where many
 workers are exposed to dangerous pesticides. The Government
 is considering a revision of the "factories act" which will
 expand the act's coverage into the agricultural sector and
 will update its standards to include regulating the use of new
 chemical products.
 Enforcement of health and safety standards remains a problem.
 Safety and health inspectors have the legal power to "enter,
 inspect, and examine, by day or night" a factory where he or
 she has "reasonable cause" to believe there may be a
 violation. Inspectors usually respond to worker complaints
 and try to enforce standards, but rarely do they make surprise
 inspections of factories. The "factories act" does not
 contain any language protecting workers who file complaints.
