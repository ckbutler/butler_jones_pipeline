 COLOMBIA
 Colombia is a strong, functioning two-party democracy, ruled
 by elected governments for all but four years (1953-57) of the
 present century. The political arena has been dominated by
 the Liberal and Conservative parties since the mid-19th
 century, but smaller parties are nominally represented in
 Congress and have fielded Presidential candidates. Members of
 Congress and the President are elected in separate elections
 every four years. In the 1982 elections, which produced the
 largest voter turnout in recent history, Belisario Betancur,
 the Conservative candidate, won the Presidency while the
 Liberals took control of Congress. Governors, mayors, and
 members of the Cabinet are appointed by the President under a
 constitutional provision which calls for "adequate and
 equitable' representation in government of members of the
 major party which does not hold the Presidency.
 Civil and political liberties are guaranteed by the
 Constitution, but an overburdened and cumbersome judicial
 system more often than not results in lengthy pretrial
 detention. For much of the past 35 years, the country has
 been under a constitutionally authorized state of siege to
 deal with civil disturbances and insurgent movements. The
 state of siege, permitting curtailment of some civil an.
 political freedoms, was lifted in 1982 but reimposed in March
 1984 in the Departments of Huila, Meta, Cauca and Caqueta
 following a major guerrilla attack on Florencia, the capital
 of Caqueta Department. As a result of the assassination of
 the Minister of Justice on April 30, it was expanded
 nationwide on May 1. On declaring both the partial and
 nationwide states of siege, the President emphasized their
 limited applicability and temporary nature.
 Political violence stemming from historical Conservative-
 Liberal struggles has troubled Colombia since the 1950's. A
 number of guerrilla organizations exist today. In an effort
 to end insurgent violence, the Government promulgated an
 amnesty law in November 1982 which covered all guerrillas. A
 reported 1,500 guerrillas took advantage of the amnesty,
 including 331 released from prison. There have been polarized
 and emotional reactions to the amnesty. Critics cited the
 example of a guerrilla leader released from prison who
 rejoined the guerrillas, while supporters pointed to an ex-
 guerrilla leader now in local government. The Permanent
 Committee for the Defense of Human Rights, the most prominent
 human rights organization in Colombia, reported that a total
 of 59 amnestied guerrillas had been killed as of August 1984.
 Vigilante-type groups, such as the Muerte a Secuestradores
 (MAS), Death to Kidnappers, has been blamed for the violence
 against amnestied guerrillas.
 A cease-fire agreement with Colombia's largest guerrilla
 group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), was
 signed March 28, 1984 and, after President Betancur endorsed
 it, became effective May 28. The President designated a
 43-member National Verification Commission to supervise the
 accord.
 On July 18 the President named a 35-member Negotiation and
 Dialogue Commission to facilitate peace talks with the M-19,
 the Popular Liberation Army (EPL) and the Workers' Self-
 Defense Movement (ADO), which led to three additional
 
 
 470
 COLOMBIA
 cease-fire agreements effective August 30. These plus the
 FARC cease-fire agreements cover an estimated 90 percent of
 the active guerrillas in Colombia. Only the National
 Liberation Army (ELN) and a few small groups had not signed
 such accords by the end of 1984.
 The accords call for the convocation of a National Dialogue to
 consider basic governmental and economic reforms. The
 National Dialogue between the Government and representatives
 of the ADO, EPL, FARC, and M-19 began November 1. The
 cease-fire agreements have no fixed duration, but on December
 1 the Government and FARC signed a formal one-year truce
 agreement.
 The guerrilla groups that have signed cease-fire or truce
 agreements have retained their weapons but have promised not
 to use them unless unduly provoked, and they have promised to
 refrain from kidnapping and extortion. However, by most
 accounts the level of kidnappings and extortions has
 increased. Although clashes between the military/police and
 the guerrillas have fallen off, they have not yet been
 eliminated.
 During 1984 the general human rights situation in Colombia
 showed continued improvement. However, Colombia continues to
 have a high violent-death rate. Responsibility for such
 violent acts is difficult to assign. Uniforms, symbols, and
 methods of operation are appropriated by one group or the
 other--the guerrillas, the armed forces, or vigilante
 groups--either to discredit opponents or to hide culpability,
 making it difficult to determine who is responsible for which
 crime. Criminal elements, especially those connected to drug
 trafficking, are responsible for many of the deaths.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 According to the Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human
 Rights, during the period August 1983 - August 1984, 633
 people were assassinated by the armed forces, police, secret
 agents, paramilitary groups, or unknown persons. The
 Committee also listed 274 death threats and 133 woundings and
 attempted assassinations by security forces and paramilitary
 organizations. The great majority of these offenses took
 place in rural areas, for example, the mid-Magdalena River
 Valley, where the military was fighting guerrilla groups and
 where confirmation of reports is often difficult. The
 Committee's statistics are based on press reports, personal
 testimony, and complaints filed by relatives and friends of
 the victims. The Committee does little investigation of the
 merit of each alleged violation reported.
 During the period January-August 1984, according to armed
 forces statistics, 67 members of the national police and 57
 members of the armed forces were killed by guerrillas, while
 431 guerrillas died. During.the same period, 278 civilians
 were reported to have been assassinated by guerrillas,
 primarily the FARC, for failure to support the guerrillas or
 for presumed assistance to the security forces.

 COLOMBIA
 b. Disappearance
 The Permanent Committee reported that 94 people had
 disappeared or had been kidnapped in the period January-July
 1984. Twenty-eight of these offenses were attributed to
 security forces, 48 to paramilitary organizations, and the
 remaining 18 to persons unknown.
 A report released by the Attorney General on October 20 stated
 that 150 persons disappeared between September 1977 and
 October 1984. It attributes some of the disappearances to
 military and security forces personnel, but stresses that such
 crimes were carried out by soldiers and policemen acting on
 their own, which in no way compromises the military or police
 institutions. The report also attributes disappearances to
 both paramilitary and guerrilla forces and asserts that the
 Government is doing its best to restrain all three sources of
 disappearances. None of the military personnel named in a
 1983 report by the Attorney General as having been involved in
 vigilante-type activity has been brought to trial.
 There was a rash of kidnapping in rural areas in 1984,
 primarily of cattlemen and large landowners. Large ransoms
 were demanded and, in most cases, paid. In many cases, the
 ransomed victims believed they were held by guerrilla groups
 because of the organizational skill, weapons, and ideological
 rhetoric used during the kidnapping and the negotiations to
 release them; guerrillas have traditionally used kidnapping
 and extortion to raise funds. In other cases, criminals
 motivated by purely financial gain are believed to have been
 responsible.
 According to press reports, kidnapping reached a new high in
 1984. Of 215 reported incidents, 132 were attributed to
 guerrillas and 83 to common criminals. Nine victims were
 killed, 66 remained in the hands of captors at year's end, and
 the remainder escaped or were rescued or ransomed.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is forbidden by law. However, the Permanent Committee
 for the Defense of Human Rights listed 275 cases of torture
 between August 1983 and August 1984; 158 were attributed to
 the security forces, 72 to paramilitary organizations, and the
 remainder to persons unknown. Most of the cases are reported
 from rural areas. Press reports indicate many murder victims
 of vigilante groups showed signs of torture. It is impossible
 to determine in fact how extensive these acts are and how
 many, if any, are perpetrated by persons linked to the
 Government.
 Many prisons are overcrowded, and one--on the Pacific island
 of Gorgona--is being closed because of its deteriorating
 condition. Conditions in many prisons are poor. In most,
 inmates are fed a subsistence diet but can supplement it with
 purchases from prison stores. Prisoners with financial
 resources live better than those without. Family members and
 friends are normally allowed to visit regularly and'to bring
 food and clothes. Consular officers are given regular access
 to foreign prisoners. Most prisoners accused of crimes in
 connection with guerrilla activities have-been incarcerated in
 regular prisons, although segregated from common criminals.

 COLOMBIA
 In June 1983 the International Labor Organization Committee on
 the Application of Conventions and Recommendations observed
 that despite the explanations of the Colombian Government,
 certain legal provisions made it possible to impose forced
 labor on detained persons who had not been convicted. It
 tooknote, though, of the Government's intention to reform the
 prison code-and bring it into conformity with ILO Convention
 29 on forced labor.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Colombia's Constitution provides for habeas corpus procedures,
 and the law requires that individuals be brought to court
 within 72 hours of arrest in most cases. These requirements
 are respected in practice. Persons detained for disturbance
 of public order can be held up to 10 days before charges need
 to be filed. There are no legal provisions for exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The rights of public trial and due process are guaranteed to
 all by the Constitution. A prisoner may be represented by an
 attorney of his choice, or if he has none, the court will
 appoint one. The overburdened judicial system, however, has
 meant most persons indicted for common crimes never come to
 trial, but are simply released after serving the minimum
 sentence applicable to the crime in question. According to
 the Minister of Justice, in January 1984 there were
 approximately 25,000 prisoners, 17,000 of whom were in
 pretrial detention. A bill has recently passed Congress
 authorizing special judges to hear cases of extortion,
 kidnapping, and terrorism, as well as to reduce the number of
 trials by expanding the jurisdiction of police inspectors to
 try less serious crimes. At the same time, the Justice
 Ministry is considering plans to streamline the court system
 and revise the penal code.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution requires a court order before authorities can
 enter a private home, except in the case of 'hot pursuit' of a
 person seen committing a crime. While some human rights
 organizations allege widespread violations in remote areas of
 the country, the concept of the sanctity of the home and
 privacy is widely respected in most parts of the country.
 Persons from rural areas have claimed that they were forced to
 leave their farms because of guerrilla activity.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These constitutionally-guaranteed rights are as a rule
 respected, and the press often vigorously criticizes the
 Government and its leaders. The privately-owned print media
 are under no government restraints, publishing a wide variety
 of political views.
 Television channels are controlled by the state, which leases
 time to private companies. The Government does not permit
 private news programs to broadcast interviews which last
 longer than ten minutes; during political campaigns, news
 programs cannot broadcast the voice of a candidate whose
 
 
 473
 COLOMBIA
 campaign rally is being filmed. There is no such restriction
 on 'talk shows." A section of a bill on electoral reform
 before Congress calls for ensured access to the electronic
 media for all political parties.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Puulic meetings, marches, and demonstrations are normally held
 without interference. Under the state of siege, prior
 permission is required for demonstrations, but it is usually
 granted, except when there is a clear and present danger to
 public order.
 Colombian workers freely exercise the right to form unions
 and, in the private sector, to bargain collectively and
 strike. There are four labor confederations (including one
 associated with the Communist Party) and an estimated 7,000
 unions. Approximately 12 percent of the total labor force is
 unionized. Among the four confederations, the Confederation
 ot Colombian Workers and the Union of Colombian Workers are
 affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions. The remaining two, the Trade Union Confederation of
 Colombia and the General Confederation of Labor, are
 affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions and the
 World Confederation of Labor, respectively. The labor code is
 administered impartially, regardless of the ideology of the
 union. Trade union leaders participate fully in the electoral
 process and are often members of the National Congress and
 municipal assemblies.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of religion. Although an
 overwhelming majority of Colombians are Roman Catholics, no
 constitutional or practical discrimination exists against any
 religious group. According to official statistics, 217
 different religious sects are registered in Colombia.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Colombians are free to leave the country without unusual
 restrictions. In areas under military control, where
 operations against rural guerrilla groups are underway, the
 movement of civilians requires "safe conduct' passes;
 guerrillas reportedly use a similar means to restrict travel
 in areas under their control.
 Colombians who nave sought and been granted 'diplomatic
 asylum' in foreign embassies have always been allowed to
 depart. Expatriates can, by law, repatriate, and the right is
 respected in practice. Colombia in the past has accepted
 refugees--the most recent case involving Chileans expelled by
 tne Chilean Government in September 1984. However, because of
 high unemployment and underemployment, the Government is
 increasingly reluctant to accept displaced persons.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Colomoia has a strong two-party democratic system of
 government, and elections are conducted fairly and openly.
 Persons over 18 years of age have the constitutional right to
 vote. Those convicted of certain crimes may be
 
 
 474
 COLOMBIA
 disenfranchised. Public employees are forbidden by law to
 participate in political campaigns but, with the exception of
 military personnel, can vote.
 Colombian politics are dominated by two major parties, the
 Liberal and the Conservative. Each includes elements with
 widely divergent political views. All parties are free to
 raise funds, field candidates, hold public meetings, have
 access to the media, and publish their own newspapers. Almost
 seven million--approximately 60 percent of eligible
 voters--turned out for the May 30, 1982, Presidential
 election, the heaviest voter turnout in recent history. Many
 went to the polls despite guerrilla threats to punish those
 who did so.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has actively participated in international and
 regional human rights bodies, is currently a member of the UN
 Human Rights Commission, and has invited nongovernmental human
 rights organizations to visit. Freedom House classifies
 Colombia as 'free.' Amnesty International Report 1984
 expressed concern about extrajudicial executions and
 systematic torture carried out 'as a matter of policy' by some
 army and police entities, as well as cases of execution-style
 killings of kidnap victims held captive by guerrilla
 organizations. On the other hand, Amnesty International
 welcomed measures by the Attorney General and civilian courts
 to investigate and prosecute military and police officials
 alleged to be responsible for serious abuses of authority.
 The Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human Rights is the
 most active national organization monitoring the local human
 rights situation. Statistics prepared by this committee have
 been used extensively by international organizations such as
 Amnesty Interpational, Americas Watch, and the Washington
 Office on Latin America. Colombian human rights organizations
 follow trials of those accused of rebellion, investigate
 reports of human rights violations, provide defense lawyers,
 and publish newsletters. Periodic human rights forums are
 held in Colombia.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The economic slowdown which began in 1980 has continued, and
 the real Gross Domestic Product growth rate for 1984 is
 expected to be only one to two percent. Colombia's population
 of 28,901,000 grew at a rate of 2.1 percent in 1984.
 Inflation is declining. Government data shows unemployment
 rose to 13.8 percent in September 1984, with underemployment
 at 14 to 16 percent. According to Colombian labor experts,
 official labor statistics do not take into account an
 estimated 2.5 million children under age 15 who work for low
 pay under poor conditions and with little protection by the
 Colombian labor code. Although increases in minimum wages
 have more than kept pace with increases in the cost of living
 in recent years, a large percentage of workers do not earn the
 minimum wage.
 Per capita Gross National Product in 1982 was $1,463, but
 there is inequality in the distribution of the nation's income
 and wealth. According to a 1983 World Bank report, the
 
 
 475
 COLOMBIA
 wealthiest 10 percent of Colombia's population received 40
 percent of the national income, while the poorest 20 percent
 got only 5 percent. A notable exception to the general
 pattern of income distribution is in Colombia's important
 coffee-growing regions, where farms have traditionally been
 small-to-medium-sized. More recently, some small farms in the
 higher altitude areas of Bogota and Medellin have been able to
 take advantage of the increasing export demand for fresh-cut
 flowers. Colombia has a highly progressive income tax, but
 tax evasion is widespread and direct taxation is declining as
 a proportion of government revenue.
 Land tenure is a major problem: the top 10 percent of
 landowners hold 80 percent of the land, while the bottom 10
 percent'own 0.2 percent. Significant regional inequalities
 also exist, with the best economic opportunities, health care
 facilities, and education available in the largest cities.
 This has contributed to heavy, though decreasing, migration
 from the countryside to urban aras.
 The Betancur Administration has promised to provide 400,000
 low-cost housing units between 1983 and 1985 and to
 concentrate on rural adult literacy and vocational training.
 The Government will also offer extension courses at the
 university level to expand education. The 1983 budget for the
 social sector ministries (labor, government, health, and
 education) accounted for approximately 28.5 percent of total
 expenditures.
 While there is an excess of teachers nationwide, there is a
 severe shortage in the countryside. Primary school enrollment
 has increased, and the adjusted enrollment ratio of 115.8
 percent in 1981 is partially explained by frequent repetition
 and the presence of adolescents and adults in the primary
 grades. The adult literacy rate was estimated at 81 percent
 In 1973. Colombia's infant mortality rate was 63.6 per 1,000
 live births in 1984. While the ratio of calorie supply
 available for consumption relative to nutritional requirements
 in 1977 was 98 percent, per capita consumption of important
 commodities such as meat, eggs, and milk declined between 1948
 and 1978, and malnutrition is a leading cause of death among
 children under five years. According to World Bank
 statistics, 63 percent (1976) of the population has access to
 safe water.
 Women have equal civil and property rights by law. Their
 economic situation, though improving, is inferior, especially
 in rural aras; they comprise just over 25 percent of the
 country's economically active population, but are concentrated
 in low-productivity, low-income sectors. Historically, the
 unemployment rate for women has been higher than for men, but
 this difference has decreased in recent years. Although
 Colombian women are legally entitled to pay equal to that of
 their male counterparts and are normally paid equal salaries
 when employed by the Government, this is not generally the
 case in private industry.
 As more Colombian women graduate from universities and
 participate in the work force, they are iocreasingly active at
 all levels of society. A growing number are receiving higher
 education; they currently comprise 40 percent of the
 university population. They serve as legislators, judges,
 department governors, political party leaders, government
 officials, and diplomats. Perhaps the most obvious indicator
 
 
 COLOMBIA
 of the growing role of Colombian women in urban society is the
 unprecedented number of high-level women appointees in the
 Betancur administration. Currently the Ministries of
 Education and Communication are headed by women. Moreover,
 female vice ministers have been appointed in the Ministries of
 Foreign Relations, Justice, Treasury, Agriculture,
 Development, Mines, Labor, Health, Education, Communications,
 and Public Works.
 Colombian Indians enjoy all rights and privileges of full
 citizenship. Notwithstanding their constitutional rights,
 Colombian Indians have at times suffered a wide variety of
 abuses at the hands of local landowners, cattlemen, and
 prospectors. The Government has curtailed the worst of such
 abuses and is now seeking to promote improved local relations
 through community action, public education, and legal aid.
 While there were sporadic land invasions by Indian groups in
 1983, an upsurge occurred beginning in mid-1984 and is
 continuing unabated. While some landowners attribute the
 surge to leftist political activities, others consider it a
 natural result of the current politicking over land reform.
 Whatever the cause, the trend toward increased invasions has
 generated growing concern among government and land-owning
 circles.
