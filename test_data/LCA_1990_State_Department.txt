 ST. LUCIA
 St. Lucia is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy and a
 member of the Commonwealth of Nations. For much of its 11
 years of independence, it has been led by incumbent Prime
 Minister John Compton whose United Workers Party (UWP)
 defeated the St. Lucia Labor Party in the 1982 elections.
 Compton was reelected in 1987, and the UWP currently holds a
 small majority of seats in Parliament. Elections are next due
 in 1992 but can be called earlier by the Prime Minister.
 The Royal St. Lucia Police, which is the only security force
 in the country, includes a small Special Service Unit with
 some paramilitary training and a coast guard unit. The police
 have traditionally demonstrated a high degree of integrity,
 professionalism, and respect for human rights.
 St. Lucia has experienced several years of sustained economic
 growth, particularly in agriculture, tourism, and, more
 recently, in manufacturing and construction. Economic
 performance in all four sectors was strong during 1990, but an
 unemployment rate of around 18 percent remains a problem.
 Human rights continued to be well respected during the year.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial
 killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances or politically
 motivated abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture, and no such
 incidents were reported.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Government adheres to the constitutional provision
 prohibiting arbitrary arrest or imprisonment and requiring a
 court hearing within 72 hours after detention. There were no
 reports of arbitrary arrest or other forms of extralegal
 detention, or of forced exile in 1990.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution requires public trials before an indgpedent
 and impartial court, and the provision of legal counsel for
 indigents. Criminal defendants are entitled to select their
 own legal counsel, are presumed innocent until proven guilty,
 and have the right of appeal. Both constitutional and
 statutory requirements for fair public trials are followed.
 The regional West Indies Court of Appeal, a circuit court long

 ST. LUCIA
 noted for its impartiality, serves as St. Lucia's appeals
 court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no reports of arbitrary intrusion by the State into
 the private lives of individual citizens. Authorities
 consistently observe constitutional prohibitions against
 arbitrary search, seizure, and entry.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Constitutional provisions for free speech and press are
 respected in practice. The Government neither interferes with
 the operations of the press nor censors the content of the
 three privately owned major newspapers, which cover the
 spectrum of political opinion afid are often highly critical of
 the Government. The one local television station is also
 privately owned. While Radio St. Lucia is government owned
 and operated,-the programming staff has been allowed a large
 measure of autonomy following a 1988 incident in which the
 Government suspended a controversial radio call-in program, an
 action that provoked a public outcry.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of association and of assembly are provided for by
 the Constitution. Permits for public meetings and
 demonstrations are necessary if meetings are to be held in
 public places such as streets, sidewalks, or parks. Permits
 are routinely granted and are not denied for political
 reasons. Refusal to issue a permit is rare and generally
 stems from the failure of the organizers to request a permit
 in a timely manner, normally defined as a 48-hour notice.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The majority of the population is Roman Catholic, but other
 denominations are free to maintain places of worship, train
 clergy, establish religious schools, and engage in the full
 range of activities normally associated with religious
 organizations. St. Lucia's small Protestant community
 functions without impediment.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 These rights are provided for in the Constitution and honored
 in practice.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 St. Lucia's parliamentary system provides for genuine choices
 among parties, policies, and officials. Although currently
 there are two main parties, several other political
 organizations also participate in free elections, which are
 held at least every 5 years by secret ballot. The opposition
 St. Lucia Labor Party plays a significant role in the
 country's political life, and presently holds 7 of 17 seats in
 the House of Assembly.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no local human rights groups in St. Lucia.
 International human rights organizations filed no reports or
 requests for investigations in 1990.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Government policy is basically nondiscriminatory in the areas
 of housing, jobs, education, and advancement opportunities.
 There are no legal restrictions on the role of women or
 minorities.
 Violence directed specifically against women, including
 domestic violence such as wife beating, has not been a major
 public policy issue in St. Lucia. Lack of statistical data
 and possible reluctance on the part of some victims to report
 cases or to press charges make it difficult to gauge its true
 extent. Police and courts do enforce laws to protect women
 against abuse, although, generally, police tend to be
 reluctant to intervene in domestic disputes. In 1989 a
 women's rights organization was established to monitor
 existing abuses. The group held a number of public meetings
 to publicize the plight of battered women, and staged a large
 demonstration to protest the killing of a woman who was beaten
 to death. Cases of this sort are rare, and the Government has
 not considered additional legislation or other specific
 remedial action, but supports the efforts of the monitoring
 group. In 1990 the Government's Women's Affairs Bureau, in
 conjunction with representatives of various women's groups,
 drafted a policy statement to be voted upon by Parliament.
 The document wds under Cabinet review at year's end.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution specifies the right of workers to form or
 belong to trade unions under the broader rubric of the right
 of association. Unions are independent of the Government and
 are free to choose their own representatives. Union elections
 are sometimes vigorously contested. All unions are free to
 publicize their views and choose policies to advance their
 members' interests.
 One recently formed union, the Technical and Allied Workers
 Union (TAWU), led by St. Lucia Labor Party Deputy Peter Josie,
 experienced difficulties with the Registrar of Trade Unions
 and was deregistered in 1990 for failure to comply with
 government regulations (the Trade Union Act). There is no
 reason to believe that political considerations played a major
 role in the deregistration of the TAWU, although regulations
 appear to have been applied more stringently to the TAWU than
 to previous, similarly formed unions.
 Strikes in the private sector are legal if efforts sponsored
 by the Government to resolve disputes fail. Strikes do occur
 from time to time. A strike by nurses was resolved in late
 
 
 763
 
 ST. LUCIA
 1988; there were no strikes in 1989. Early in 1990 the
 National Workers' Union staged a brief (less than a week)
 strike at a construction site over the dismissal of a worker
 who was eventually reinstated.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international organizations,
 and some have done so. St. Lucia has ratified International
 Labor Organization Conventions 87 and 98 pertaining to freedom
 of association and collective bargaining. St. Lucia has no
 legislation that prohibits forming union associations.
 However, some companies offer packages of benefits with terms
 of employment which make unionization less attractive; the
 company package is better or comparable to what the union can
 offer. This is especially true in export processing or
 industrial free zones in St. Lucia.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions have the legal right to engage in collective bargaining
 and fully exercise that right. Unions represent the majority
 of wage and salary earners. During 1989 the Government
 succeeded in negotiating a 6-year wage agreement with 6 unions
 representing public servants, resulting in unusually
 harmonious government-labor relations. Antiunion
 discrimination by employers against union members is
 prohibited by law, and there are effective mechanisms for
 resolving complaints. Union organizing and collective
 bargaining are neither legally nor administratively
 discouraged in the industrial free zones, but no unions and no
 collective bargaining agreements existed in the zones as of
 the end of 1990.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is illegal and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum legal working age is 14 years, as stipulated by
 the Women and Young Persons Act. The law is enforced
 effectively by Labor Ministry officials.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Although no minimum wage is established by law, a
 government-sponsored Wage Council reviews wage rates in
 different sectors and offers wage recommendations which
 generally are accepted as having the force of law. There is
 no legislated maximum workweek, although common practice is 40
 hours in 5 days. Occupational health and safety regulations
 are relatively well developed. The Labor Ministry
 periodically inspects health and safety conditions at places
 of employment under the Employees Occupational Safety and
 Health Act of 1985. The Act is enforced through threat of
 closure of business if violations are discovered and not
 corrected.
