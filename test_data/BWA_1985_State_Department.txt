 BOTSWANA
 Botswana is a multiparty democracy with free elections, an
 independent judiciary, a police force, and a small,
 well-disciplined army subservient to civilian authority. Under
 the Constitution, executive power is vested in the President,
 chosen in a national election for a 5 year term, most recently
 in 1984. The President, currently Quett K.J. Masire, selects
 the Cabinet from the National Assembly. One party continues to
 dominate the country's politics; the Botswana Democratic Pary
 (BDP) has held a majority in the National Assembly since
 independence in 1966 and now controls 28 of 34 elective seats.
 Botswana encourages private enterprise and free trade. All
 citizens, including those whites who accepted Botswana
 citizenship, are free to participate in the economic and
 political life of the country. More than 83 percent of the
 population lives in rural areas and is dependent on some form
 of agricultural activity.
 Botswana's human rights record generally remains excellent.
 Citizens receive equal protection under the law; domestic
 political violence is unknown; public debate, including in the
 press, is lively; and several women hold positions of
 importance in the public and private sector. For more than a
 decade, Botswana has been a haven for refugees from the
 political and military strife of neighboring countries. South
 African actions, including the South African Defence Force raid
 on Gaborone in June 1985 and two bombings which the Government
 of Botswana attributed to South Africa, have neither
 destabilized Botswana's Government nor encouraged restrictive
 measures.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The Government of Botswana has never been accused of
 involvement in political killings. There is no guerrilla or
 insurgency activity.
 b. Disappearance
 The Botswana Constitution provides for the protection of
 personal liberty. There have been no allegations of secret
 arrests or clandestine detentions.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been no reports of improper treatment by the police
 of criminals or criminal suspects during 1985. Prison
 conditions allow for adequate diet, health care, and visits
 from family members. Jails are sometimes crowded, however, and
 inmates with no relatives to see to their needs may encounter
 difficulty in arranging for assistance. Flogging is permitted
 for infractions of prison rules and is a mandatory punishment
 for rape, attempted rape, armed robbery, burglary,
 housebreaking, and related offenses. No summary executions
 have occurred.

 BOTSWANA
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Botswana Constitution contains a provision protecting
 citizens from arbitrary arrest. Preventive detention is
 illegal. There is a functioning system of bail, and defendants
 have access to lawyers of their own choosing. As required by
 law, the police bring a suspect before a magistrate for .
 charging within 48 hours of his arrest. Suspects must be
 released after 48 hours unless the magistrate issues a warrant
 of detention which is valid for 14 days. Every 14 days, the
 police must appear before the magistrate and show that they are
 making progress in the case. To date, there have been no known
 instances of abuse of this system. Forced labor is illegal in
 Botswana.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is provided by law and is
 honored in practice. Defendants are entitled to counsel;
 consultation between defendants and counsel may be held in
 private. The judiciary is independent of the executive and
 military. The High Court has ruled that one may not be
 compelled to testify against oneself. Moreover, silence cannot
 be construed as proof of guilt, and the burden of proof remains
 on the prosecution. All trials are held in public. Provisions
 exist for conducting closed trials on matters relating to
 national security or if a minor is charged with a crime; the
 High Court provides oversight of these cases.
 In September, a judge warned that he might impose gag rules on
 a participant in the court's proceedings because of the
 sensational newspaper coverage given to a trial in which the
 defendant alleged that high government officials were guilty of
 improprieties. The High Court has made no comment on this
 warning. No citizen of Botswana has been exiled since the
 country's independence.
 There is also a system of traditional tribal courts, presided
 over by chiefs, where jurisdiction is limited to minor
 offenses.
 There are no political prisoners in Botswana.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Rights of privacy are safeguarded by law and respected in
 practice. A search warrant issued by a magistrate is required
 for an official to enter a private residence, except in cases
 of suspected diamond theft or drug trafficking. However, there
 have been no reported instances in which this exception was
 used during 1985.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedoms of speech and of the press are guaranteed by the
 Constitution and are respected in practice. The government-
 owned newspaper (in English and Setswana) continues to print
 statements from all opposition parties. Three independent
 newspapers are published on a weekly or semi-weekly basis, all
 of which publish 'articles representing a wider range of views
 than the government-owned daily. Recent coverage of the
 
 
 BOTSWANA
 Government's decision to force two persons--one a businessman,
 the other a journalist--to leave Botswana sparked a heated
 debate, especially in the National Assembly, on the role of the
 press. Government spokesmen have confined comment to stating
 that national security interests were involved in these
 expulsions and that press interests must be subordinated to
 national security interests. This latter statement led to a
 furth r round of press editorials critical of the minister's
 statement.
 Botswana has signed the Kadoma Declaration which bans entry of
 journalists from South Africa, though it has not enforced the
 ban. In its first application of some of the principles of the
 Kadoma Declaration, Botswana sought to restrict the activities
 of four South African journalists by requiring them to obtain
 visas prior to entering Botswana (not generally required of
 South Africans). Government sources were quoted as saying that
 these actions had been taken in response to the irresponsible
 reporting of the Gaborone raid by these journalists.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is a well-established tradition in
 Botswana, exemplified by the Kgotla, a communal gathering
 similar to a New England town meeting in which citizens freely
 question leaders and voice opinions on local politics. Kgotla
 meetings are used regularly by political candidates and Members
 of Parliament, including ministers, to explain their programs
 to the people. Large gatherings require local police approval,
 which is routinely given. Demonstrations are permitted so long
 as order is maintained. Organizers are required to submit a
 detailed plan for any demonstration and are personally
 responsible for ensuring that the plan is followed.
 Unions have the legal right to strike but only after exhausting
 established dispute settlement procedures, which require that
 the Government be invited to attempt to arbitrate. The last
 strike occurred in 1976. Unions have chafed under government
 regulations which prohibit the contribution of union funds from
 sources outside Botswana and require that all union leaders be
 full-time working members of the trade covered by their union,
 thus preventing employment of full-time salaried union
 organizers. Unions are important in the country's largest
 industries, mainly mining and extraction industries, but have
 not yet taken hold in other sectors of the economy.
 Independent of government control or political party
 affiliation, unions in Botswana actively represent their
 members. Unions associate freely*with international
 organizations, and leaders attend international conferences.
 The Botswana Federation of Trade Unions (BFTU) is affiliated
 with the democratically oriented International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions in Brussels and is also a member of the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity and the Southern
 African Trade Unions Congress.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The open practice of religion is permitted and encouraged in
 Botswana. There is no state religion. While most residents
 are Christians, active groups of Muslims, Hindus, Baha'is, and
 others practice their faiths freely. Religious affiliation is
 neither an advantage nor a disadvantage in the political and'
 social contexts. Religious conversion is permitted in
 
 
 23
 BOTSWANA
 Botswana, and missionaries are allowed to enter the country and
 proselytize. Foreign clergy are also permitted to enter
 Botswana to serve expatriate congregations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Botswana citizens are not restricted with respect to
 emigration, repatriation, or domestic or foreign travel.
 Passports are easily obtained. Refugees documented by the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), mostly
 Zimbabweans, are generally required to live in the refugee
 settlement at Dukwe in northern Botswana. While conditions are
 relatively good, the U.N. Security Council has called for
 increased levels of international assistance to Botswana to
 improve the Dukwe refugee camp. Refugees may be authorized to
 live elsewhere for reasons such as employment or schooling. As
 with other foreigners in Botswana, refugees are not permitted
 to accept jobs which could be filled by citizens. There are
 allegations from some refugee-producing countries that refugees
 are using Botswana as a sanctuary from which to pursue
 activities directed against their governments. Hence, the
 Government of Botswana has declared that Dukwe residents found
 outside the camp without permission will be considered to have
 abandoned refugee status and will be repatriated; as will any
 refugee who engages in criminal activity or invites outside
 intervention through political activities inside of Botswana.
 A U.N. Security Council mission found that, as a result of the
 June South African raid on Gaborone, the relationship between
 refugees and citizens of Botswana has become strained since
 citizens of Botswana fear similar future attacks.
 A 1982 citizenship law, which permits the Government to
 withdraw citizenship from a person found to have committed
 disloyal acts or to have shown evidence of disaffection, was
 enforced for the first time in September 1985. A refugee from
 South Africa who had been granted Botswana citizenship was
 stripped of his citizenship and returned to South Africa
 against his will. No reason was given for the deportation and
 the UNHCR was not consulted to discuss possible resettlement in
 another country.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Botswana is ruled by a Government genuinely elected by its
 people. In the 1984 national election (the fifth since
 Botswana became independent), an estimated 70 percent of the
 eligible voters registered, and 86 percent of the registered
 voters actually voted. The election was unmarred by violence,
 and no incidents of serious fraud were reported. However, one
 election for a parliamentary seat was disputed and was
 consequently rerun; the previously defeated opposition
 candidate triumphed and took his seat in the National
 Assembly. There are five parties in Botswana, three of which
 are represented in the country's National Assembly. Opposition
 parties now control three city councils, including that of
 Gaborone, Jwaneng, and Francistown. There are two female
 members of Parliament; one, the Minister of External Affairs;
 the other, an executive secretary of the majority party. The
 one white member of Parliament is also a cabinet minister, and
 the speaker of the National Assembly is also white.
 Ethnic differences do exist in Botswana, though they play only
 a marginal role in the country's politics. Only the 50,000
 
 
 24
 BOTSWANA
 Basarwa ("Bushmen") remain generally unrepresented in
 government. Pastoralists who have little contact with the
 population centers of Botswana, the Basarwa remain relatively
 unaffected by government educational and economic assistance
 programs and consequently have participated only marginally in
 the country's political life.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Botswana cooperates with international agencies concerned with
 human rights. Relations with the Office of the UNHCR, the only
 international human rights organization active in Botswana, are
 friendly and open. There are no Botswana-based organizations
 seti up to observe, report, or contest human rights violations.
 The Government has consistently responded promptly and
 forthrightly to the inquiries it has received about the human
 rights situation in Botswana. A sparsely populated country
 surrounded by larger and more powerful neighbors, Botswana
 usually refrains from public comment on alleged human rights
 violations in neighboring countries but joins other governments
 in condemning apartheid in South Africa. Amnesty
 International, in its 1985 Report, was concerned about the use
 of the death penalty. Freedom House rated Botswana as "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Botswana's population in 1985 reached 1,068,000 and is growing
 at 3.3 percent annually. Most Batswana are involved in
 agriculture and animal husbandry, but exploitation of the
 country's mineral resources, e.g., diamonds, has helped bring
 about significant economic development and has raised
 dramatically, but not evenly, per capita gross national product
 from $69 to $920 in 17 years.
 Rural incomes are much lower than urban incomes, which has led
 to increased rural migration to the cities during the past
 decade. The urban population increased from 8 percent in 1971
 to 17 percent in 1981 and, according to government statistics,
 has reached roughly 25 percent in 1985. Severe drought has
 accelerated this trend. Despite general improvement in the
 economy during the past decade, poverty still affects a large
 proportion of the population. Based on 1979 data, the most
 recent year available, 55 percent of the rural population and
 40 percent of the urban population have incomes below the
 poverty level.
 In 1985 life expectancy at birth was 63.5 years; and infant
 mortality was 63 per 1,000 live births. The percentage of
 urban population with access to potable water increased from 71
 percent in 1968 to 100 percent in 1985; in rural areas, the
 figure remains about 39 percent due to the difficulties of
 supplying drinking water to Botswana's scattered rural
 population. According to the World Bank, the average Batswana
 in 1982 received 92 percent of the daily nutritional
 requirements. Because of the severity of the drought, the
 country has been increasingly heavily dependent on imported
 foodstuffs. Four consecutive years of severe drought depressed
 the agricultural sector of the economy, although in 1985
 rainfall was sufficient to permit planting to begin again in
 many parts of the country.
 Botswana has made steady progress in providing educational
 opportunities. The adjusted primary school enrollment ratio
 
 
 BOTSWANA
 increased from 56 in 1968 to 105 in 1981. There is a
 difference in enrollment rates between boys and girls because
 of the tradition of requiring boys to herd cattle. In 1981, the
 enrollment ratio for girls in primary school was 113, while
 that for boys was 97. The adult literacy rate was estimated at
 approximately 40 percent in 1971 and is undoubtedly higher in
 1985.
 In the area of worker rights, Botswana law prevents the
 employment of children 12 years and younger by anyone except
 members of the child's immediate family. No juvenile under the
 age of 15 can be employed in industry, and only those over 16
 can be employed in night work. No juveniles 16 or younger are
 permitted to work in hazardous jobs, including mining. Women
 are not permitted to work at night (except on an emergency
 basis in agricultural work) and are not permitted to work as
 miners. The country's law also provides for minimum working
 standards, including job safety, maximum working hours, and
 wages. For some jobs during certain seasons, Botswana law
 permits working weeks longer than 48 hours (in agricultural
 jobs during the harvest season, for example).
 Women hold approximately 24 percent of the paid jobs in
 Botswana. An estimated 41 percent of central government
 employees are women, many of them in high-level positions.
 While there is little overt sexual discrimination, social
 custom elevates the rights and privileges of men above those of
 women despite their importance in the economy. Some 40 percent
 of rural households are headed by women. Access to capital,
 labor, draft animals, seeds for farming is significantly more
 difficult for women than for men. Women who intend to marry
 may choose civil marriage, in which all property is held in
 common, or customary marriage, which recognizes the division of
 individual property brought to a marriage. Most women are not
 aware, however, of the implications of these alternatives. The
 Government has assisted in the publication of a women's rights
 handbook and has established preferences for women who seek
 government-sponsored development loans.
 The Government of Botswana promises equal treatment of all its
 citizens in the distribution of social services. However,
 since most of the Basarwa occupy the harsh and remote areas of
 the Kalahari desert where population density is very low, there
 are few clinics and schools available to them. The Government
 has built some facilities at the edge of the desert which serve
 as a magnet for Basarwa families. This in turn creates new
 problems as these occupants of the desert, traditionally
 hunter-gatherers, not accustomed to a money economy, are pushed
 towards wage labor and cattle herding where they tend to be
 absorbed into Tswana society.
