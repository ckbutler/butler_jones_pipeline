 AUSTRIA
 Austria is a constitutional parliamentary democracy. A coalition government (So-
 cial Democratic Party and People's Party), formed oriially after the 1986 national
 election, continued in office after the October 1990 election. The liberal/nationalist
 Freedom Party and the loosely united Green Party comprise the opposition.
 The police and security organs are subordinated to the executive and judicial au-
 thorities. However, there were again credible reports of ill-treatment of some people
 in police custody.
 ustria has a developed economy, and its citizens enjoy a high standard of living.
 Human rights are highly respected in Austria; individual rights and political free-
 doms are provided for in the Constitution and generally protected.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no political abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture is banned by Article II of the European Convention for the Protection of
 Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which is incorporated into the Constitu-
 tion.
 The parliamentary opposition continued to raise the issue of police brutality. Ac-
 cording to Interior Ministry statistics, complaints of police brutality decreasedfrom
 345 in 1990 to 286 in 1991. There were 115 complaints in the first half of 1992.
 In 1991, 3 policemen were convicted of brutality; 75 such cases are pending. Persons
 who file brutality complaints risk being charged with slander, in the first half of
 1992, 89 of the 115 complainants were convicted of slander. The Government contin-
 ued training police officers in new regulations which stipulate more clearly the lim-
 its of police conduct during investigations. Those regulations take effect in May
 1993.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary de-
 tention or exile. In criminal cases the law provides for investigative or pretrial de-
 tention for up to 48 hours (except in cases of charges of 'aggressive behavior"), by
 which time an investigative judge must decide on the legality of continuing the de-
 tention. Provided the prosecutor requests detention and the investigative judge
 agrees, the accused may be held for a maximum of 2 years pending completion of
 an investigation. Grounds for investigative detention are enumerated in the law, as
 are conditions for release on bail. A reform of Austrian law regarding investigative
 and pretrial detention was adopted in 1992 and is scheduled to go into effect in mid-
 1993. The law requires mandatory reevaluation of a detention by the investigative
 judge at 2 weeks, 1 month and every 2 months after the arrest.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent of the executive and
 legislative branches of government. Judges are appointed for life and may not, in
 principle, be removed from office. Jury trials are prescribed for major offenses, and
 those convicted have the right of appeal. Written charges must be presented to the
 accused who has the right to be represented by a lawyer. The accused are presumed
 innocent, and trials are public.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 provides for the protection of personal data collected, processed, or transmitted by
 government agencies, public institutions, and private entities. Constitutional provi-
 sions also protect the secrecy of the mail and telephone. Following the restructuring
 of the state police after a 1990 scandal involving the monitoring of private citizens
 without sufficient grounds, a new federal police law introduced parliamentary con-
 trol over the state police and the military secret service on a permanent basis. Sepa-
 rate parliamentary subcommittees have oversight authority for these organs.

 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-These freedoms are provided by the Constitu-
 tion and generally respected in practice, although stringent slander laws may have
 the effect of discouraging reports of policy brutality (see Section 1.c.). Austria has
 a free, independent, and multifaceted press, ranging from conservative to Com-
 munist. Publications may be removed from circulation if they violate legal provisions
 concerning morality or public security. As a matter of practice, such cases are ex-
 tremely rare. Opposition viewpoints are given wide attention in Austrian publica-
 tions. Austria's well-established and democratic political system, its active and inde-
 pendent press, and its effective judiciary combine to assure continued freedom of
 speech and press. Freedom of academic expression is respected.
 Austrian  radio  and   television  are  government monopolies but are     also
 multifaceted. There have been no complaints of subtle or direct censorship. Cable
 television is widely available, allowing Austrians access to broadcasts from the Unit.
 ed States, Germany and the Uned d Kingdom, among othera. Austrians also listen
 to radio broadcasts from other European countries.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. Public demonstrations require a permit from
 the polieauthorities,whomayconsideronlythepubicsafetyaspectof the             o-
 posed demonstration and not its political purpose. Permits are routinely issued. The
 Austrian State Treaty of 1955 makes an exception to freedom of association in the
 case of Nazi organizations and activities. The Constitutional Law of 1945, as amend-
 ed in 1947, also prohibits Nazi organizations and activities. A 1992 law lowered
 minimum sentences for neo-Nazi activities and introduced penalties for public de-
 nial, belittlement, approval, or justification of Nazi crimes. The lowering of mini-
 mum sentences has had the desired effect of increasing the conviction rate of those
 accused of neo-Nazi activities. The law on the formation of associations stipulates
 that permission to form an association may be denied if it is apparent that the orga-
 nization will pursue the illegal activities of a prohibited organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-This right is provided by the Constitution, although the
 treaty of St. Germain, which is also incorporated into the Constitution, restricts this
 freedom to the practice of religions that are compatible with public safety and mo-
 rality. In order to qualify as a recognized religious organization under Austrian law,
 religious groups register with the Government. Although 88 percent of the popu-
 lation is Roman Catholic, most of the world's major religions are represented and
 practice their faiths freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions concerning freedom of movement within the
 country or the right to change residence or workplace. Austrian residents are free
 to travel abroad and to emigrate. Citizens who have left the country have the right
 to return.
 In the summer Austria introduced a visa requirement for persons with passports
 issued by "Serbia" or the "Federal Republic of Yugoslavia." The law effective y in-
 cluded citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina who carry Yugoslav passports. The Austrian
 Government hoped to deter "ethnic cleansing" by forcing Serbia to deal with the
 non-Serb populations which could no longer find refuge in the north. It was argued
 that to take refugees from the "cleansed" regions was to support the policy of "ethnic
 cleansing." Approximately 70,000 Bosnian Muslim refugees are resident in Austria.
 In spite of government assertions to the contrary, human rights groups and lib-
 eral/left opposition groups claim that the country's refugee policies are too restric-
 tive. Austria has recently tightened its policy on refugee admissions. Refugees con-
 tinue to be allowed to enter the country if the Government receives personal guar-
 antees of support from friends, family, or charitable institutions in Austria. Opposi-
 tion groups maintain that Austria's strict new asylum laws violate the right to apply
 for asylum and the right of asylum seekers to reside in Austria while their rejected
 asylum requests are appealed. The Government insists that asylum seekers must
 apply for asylum in the first country in which they are able to make application.
 The acceptance rate for asylum seekers is 12.5 percent. Legislation was passed by
 Parliament in 1992 to curb the flow of immigrants to Austria. Annual quotas were
 introduced, and foreigners must now apply for immigration at Austrian diplomatic
 missions abroad. Residence permits initially will be issued to foreign workers but
 not to their families.
 Despite the use of armed forces to police Austria's eastern border, the Defense
 Ministry maintains that about 14,000 aliens were apprehended and deported when
 attempting to cross illegally into the country between September 1990 and Septem-
 ber 1992. The number of illegal aliens in Austria is estimated to be as high as
 150,000.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Austria is governed through a democratic parliamentary system. Under the Con-
 stitution, natonal elections must be held at least every 4 years. Elections are free,
 and they regularly draw high levels of participation. There is universal suffrage for
 those over 19 years of age.
 The national elections of 1990 resulted in the continuation of a coalition Govern-
 ment composed of the two largest political parties. No party won an absolute major-
 ity. The Social Democratic Party, which won 80 seats in Parliament, and the Peo-
 ple's Party, which won 60 seats, formed a government. Two other parties are rep-
 resented in Parliament; the liberal/ nationalist Freedom Party won 33 seats, and the
 Greens won 10. Several small parties participating in the elections (including the
 Communist Party) did not receive sufficient support to elect candidates to the Par-
 liament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Allegations of improper activities on the part of the authorities are discussed and
 investigated by the press, public groups, and private individuals without govern-
 ment hindrance. Both international and local human rights groups operate freely.
 Austria recognizes the competence of the European Human Rights Commission in
 Strasbourg for implementing the European Convention on Human Rights. Austria
 involves itself actively with international human rights matters, especially the situ-
 ation in Eastern Europe.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Austria has an extensive public welfare system, the benefits of which are avail-
 able to all citizens on a nondiscriminatory basis. In employment and in other areas
 there is comprehensive legal protection against discrimination because of race, sex,
 religion, language, or social status.
 An isolated incident of anti-Semitism-the desecration of 80 graves in a Jewish
 cemetery in Eisenstadt-was quickly and forcefully condemned by high-ranking gov-
 ernment officials and parliamentarians, prominent religious officials, and commu-
 nity leaders. A prompt investigation resulted in an arrest within 2 weeks of the inci-
 dent.
 Legal restrictions on women's rights have been abolished. Women are entering the
 work force in increasing numbers and have made substantial progress towarWeco-
 nomic equality in the i ostwar era. Nevertheless, in practice, inequality still exists
 in  political,  economic  and  social fields,  where  women    are   generally
 underrepresented. Parliament passed a women s omnibus bill in December to tight-
 en labor laws against discrimination and improve maternity regulations. Labor laws
 providing for equal treatment have been extended to women in the civil service. Ad-
 ditionally, women of equivalent qualifications are to be placed in jobs ahead of men
 in civil service areas in which less than 40 percent of the employees are women.
 The new law introduces compensation of up to 4 month's salary for women who are
 discriminated against in promotions because of their gender. The law also estab-
 lishes compensation for victims of sexual harassment. The number of reported rapes
 in Austria was 507 in 1991, down slightly from the record 533 in 1990.
 The human rights of members of Austrian minorities are fully respected. While
 the subject of Slovene language instruction for the Slovene minority in Carinthia
 has been an issue in past years, this question has largely been resolved through the
 establishment of such language courses. Occasional calls are still made for extend-
 ing these rights, by, for example, setting up bilingual village signs in Carinthia.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to form and join unions
 without prior authorization, This right is protected under general constitutional
 guarantees of freedom of association . In pract ice, Austrian trade unions have an im-
 portant and independent voice in the political, social, and economic life of the coun-
 try. In 1992, 58 percent of the work force was organized in 14 national unions (down
 from 15 after two small unions merged), each or which is a member of the Austrian
 Trade Union Federation (ATUF). This organization has a strong, centralized leader-
 ship structure. Individual unions and the Federation are independent of government
 or political party control, although there, are formal factions within these organiza-
 tions that are closely allied with political parties.
 Although the right to strike is not explicitly provided by the Constitution or by
 national legislation, it is universally recognized as a right of workers. Strikes in the
 postwar period have been comparatively few and usually of short duration. High on
 
 
 the list of reasons for Austria's record of labor peace is the system of "social partner-
 ship"-Austria's nearly unique unofficial forum for cooperation among labor, man-
 agement, and government. At the center of the system is the Joint Parity Commis-
 sion for wages and prices, which has an important voice on major economic ques-
 tions.
 The ATUF, its political wings, and its member unions are active in Europe and
 beyond and have affiliations with all three world labor federations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bar ain Colectively.-Unions have the right to or-
 ganize and bargain collectively. The abor movement enjoys widespread acceptance,
 and almost all large companies, private and state-owned, are organized. Worker
 councils representing all of the workers in a unit operate at the enterprise level,
 and workers are entitled by law to elect one-third of the members of the supervisory
 boards of major companies. Collective agreements covering wages, benefits, and
 working conditions are negotiated by the ATUF on behalf of its member unions with
 the National Chamber of Commerce and its associations, which represent the em-
 ployers within a framework of wage-price policy guidelincs set by the Joint Parity
 Commission. A 1973 law imposes on employers in enterprises with more than five
 employees the obligation to prove that job dismissals are not motivated by antiunion
 discrimination. The International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee of Experts
 again in 1992 called on the Government to fulfill its obligations under ILO Conven-
 tion 98 on the right to organize and collective bargaining by enacting legislation ex-
 tending legal protection against arbitrary dismissals to employees in enterprises
 with fewer than five employees.
 Workers are further protected by mandatory membership in the Austrian Chain-
 bers of Labor, to which all employees except civil servants belong. These Chambers
 fulfill several functions that are handled by trade unions in other countries, such
 as carrying out studies and preparing legislative proposals. The Chambers are
 obliged to provide free legal assistance, including a lawyer, to any employee request-
 ing it. Typically, legal disputes between employer and employees regarding job-relat-
 ed matters are handled Ty a special arbitration court for social  airs. The ATUF
 is exclusively responsible for collective bargaining. The leaderships of both the
 Chambers and the ATUF are elected democratically.
 Austria has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by law
 and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum legal working age
 is 15. The law is effectively enforced by the Labor Inspectorate of the Ministry of
 Social Affairs.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legislated national minimum wage.
 Instead, nationwide coliective bargaining agreements set minimum wage rates by
 job classification for each industry. A worker whose annual income falls below a pov-
 erty line (approximately $850 per family member per month) is eligible to receive
 social welfare benefits. The average Austrian has a high standard of living, and
 even workers at the low end of the wage scale have a relatively adequate minimum
 standard. Although the legal workweek has been established at 40 hours since 1975,
 more than 50 percent of the labor force enjoys collective bargaining agreements set-
 ting the standard workweek at 38 or 38.5 hours.
 ustria  as enacted extensive legislation setting occupational health and safety
 standards, under which the Labor Inspectorate attached to the Ministry of Social
 Affairs conducts inspections and ensures the effective protection of workers in these
 areas. Inspectors have the authority to "tag" an observed safety or health risk with-
 out a court order, an action that effectively shuts down the affected machinery or
 process until it comes into line with mandatory safety standards. Workers may file
 complaints anonymously with the Labor Inspectorate, which may bring suit against
 the employer on behalf of the employee. In practice, this option is rarely exercised;
 workers normally rely instead on the Chambers of Labor, which file suits on their
 behalf.
