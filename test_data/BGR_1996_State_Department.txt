 BULGARIA
 Bulgaria is a parliamentary republic ruled by a democratically elected govern-
 ment. President Zhelyu Zhelev, former chairman of the Union of Democratic Forces
 (UDF), was elected in 1992 to a 5-year term in the country's first direct presidential
 elections. Petar Stoyanov of the UDF won new presidential elections in the fall and
 will succeed Zhelev in January 1997. The Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), heir to
 the Communist Party, and two nominal coalition partners won an absolute majority
 in preterm elections in December 1994 and have ruled since then. The judiciary is
 independent but continued to struggle with structural and staffing problems.
 Most security services are the responsibility of the Ministry of the Interior, which
 controls the police, the Central Srvice for Combating Organized Crime, the Na-
 tional Security Service (civilian intelligence), internal security troops, border guards,
 and special forces. A number of persons known to be involved in repressive activities
 during the Communist regime returned to senior-level positions in the security serv-
 ices in 1995 and retained these positions in 1996. Some members of the police force
 committed serious human rights abuses.
 The post-Communist economy remains heavily dependent on money-losing state
 enterprises, although the private sector now accounts for about 45 percent of eco-
 nomic activity. Most people are employed in the industrial and service sectors; key
 industries include food processing, chemical and oil processing, metallurgy, and en-
 ergy. Principal exports are agricultural products, cigarettes and tobacco, chemicals,
 and metal products. The transformation of the economy into a market-oriented sys-
 tem has been retarded by continued political and social resistance. Slow progress
 in privatization of the large Communist-era state enterprises has been a major rea-
 son for economic stagnation. The Government is now implementing a mass privat-
 ization program which, if successful, would partially address this problem The serv-
 ice and consumer goods sectors in private hands continued to be the most vibrant.
 After a period of superficial economic stability and revived growth in 1995, a crisis
 in the financial system occurred in early 1996, accompanied by a sharp devaluation
 of the country's currency, high inflation, and a serious grain shortage. This implo-
 sion helped prd the Government toward economic restructuring and, late in the
 year, to speed up privatization. Reform measures include an austerity package with
 layoffs at state-owned enterprises, which is expected to increase unemployment sub-
 stantially. The economic crisis has affected the employment of people from ethnic
 minorities disproportionately. The annual per capita gross domestic product of
 $1,205 provides a low standard of living.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, but prob-
 lems remained in some areas. Police used unwarranted lethal force against suspects
 
 
 877
 
 and minorities in some cases, and security forces beat suspects and inmates. Human
 rights observers charged that the security forces are not sufficiently accountable to
 Parliament or to society and that the resultant climate of impunity is a major obsta-
 cle to ending police abuses. Prison conditions are harsh, and pretrial detention is
 often prolonged. The judiciary is underpaid, understaffed and has a heavy case
 backlog. Most citizens have little confidene in their legal system. Constitutional re-
 strictions on political parties formed on ethnic, racial, or religious lines effectively
 limit participation for some gups. Societal mistreatment of ethnic minorities is a
 serious problem, and both the Government and private citizens continued to ob-
 struct the activities of some non-Eastern Orthodox religious groups. Human rights
 groups report that the Government does not adequately assist homeless and other
 vulnerable children, notably Romani children, and that security forces harass, phys-
 ically abuse and arbitrarily arrest and detain Romani street children. Discrimina-
 tion and violence against women and Roma remain serious problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Police officers used unwarranted le-
 thal force against criminal suspects, as well as against members of minority groups
 whether or not suspected of any crime, resulting in two deaths.
 On January 29, a 17-year-oldRom, Anguel Zabchikov, died while in police custody
 in Rgrad apparently as a result of a beating. The police told Zavchikov's family
 that he fell and fractured his skull while fleeing the police and died instantly. The
 police later reported that he died as a result of excessive alcohol in the bloodstream.
 In addition to the fractured skull, Zabhikov's family described numerous signs of
 severe beating and handcuff marks on both wrists. An investigation is in progress.
 On April 15, Ivan Benchev was found beaten to death in Sofia. Benchev ad been
 arrested with a friend on April 14 for making a false bomb threat. After the police
 released him, he was attacked and abducted 50 meters from the police station. In
 July the Ministry of Interior dismissed three policemen for organizing Benchev's
 beating and kidnaping with former police colleagues now working at a private secu-
 rity firm. A military prosecutor is investigating the case.
 On October 2, former Prime Minister Andrei Lukanov was shot and killed outside
 his home; neither motive nor perpetrators have yet been identified. Some of his col-
 leagues claimed that his assassination was linked to his plans to publicize corrup-
 tion at the highest levels of the BSP; others saw the killing as a gangland-style
 murder related to his business dealings.
 In June three policemen were convicted of the 1995 murder of a male in police
 custody. Two of the officers were sentenced to 20 years and the third to 18 years
 in prison. One of the remaining three policemen was convicted of inflicting bodily
 harm and extorting a confession and was given a lesser sentence; the other two re-
 ceived suspended sentences.
 The investigation into the February 1995 suspicious death of a Rom in Gradets
 was closed after a coroner determined that the man died as a result of freezing to
 death rather than as a result of a beating. There was little progress in the investiga-
 tion of the March 1995 killing of a 22-year-old Rom by a police sergeant in Nova
 Zagora. The investigation into the September 1994 case of a detainee who died 1
 day after being taken into police custody in Pleven was suspended in March by the
 district prosecutor's office. In July, after a local human rights organization appealed
 the district prosecutor's decision, the chief prosecutor's office overturned the suspen-
 sion and ordered the investigation to resume.
 Interior Ministry data on serious police violations over the 18 months ending
 March 31, 1995, show 18 deaths due to police negligence, 59 cases of physical injury,
 more than 60 charges of serious offenses, and 58 convictions of police officers on
 these and lesser charges during the period. The then-Minister of Interior acknowl-
 edged that police abuses occur and made a commitment to address the problem. For
 example, penalties were reportedly imposed on 272 employees during the month of
 May or unspecified offenses and breaches of discipline: 7 were dismissed and 11 re-
 duced in rank. The police have generally refused to make investigative reports avail-
 able to the public. The climate of impunity that still prevails is the single largest
 obstacle to ending abuses.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution expressly prohibits torture and crue, inhuman, or degrading treat-
 ment.
 Despite this prohibition, police beat criminal suspects and Roma during arrests.
 In January, according to a report by the Starna Zagora Regional Directorate for In-
 
 
 ternal Affairs, three men dressed in police uniforms, presenting themselves as offi-
 cers of the Sofia Directorate for Internal Affairs, abducted and beat 23-year-old
 Kamen Chausev who was in preventive detention in Kazanluk. In February police
 reportedly beat Vasilev Dobrev, a passenger in the car of Georgi Goergiev, when
 Dobrev intervened to support Georgiev's refusal to pay a bribe demanded by the po-
 lice. Investigations were initiated in both cases. In February, according to news-
 paper reports, Ahmed Mustatov of Bratovo was arrested and allegedly beaten by
 tr    officers. The local prosecutor is reviewing the findings of a preliminary police
 in llarch, according to Human Rights Watch, an off-duty police officer in Russe
 beat a Romani couple when they refused to pay a bribe. No charges were brought.
 Police reportedly beat six Roma in the village of Barkatch in April after catching
 them stealing corn from a nearby field. The next day police broke into a house in
 the village and, after accusing the occupants of hiding stolen corn, beat a man and
 his 15-year-old son. No police officers were charged or investigated. In May the po-
 lice reportedly beat two men after arresting them at the funeral of three murdered
 policemen. The men were not charged with a crime and, after they were released,
 sought medical attention for their injuries. The beatings were widely reported in the
 press, but again no officers have been charged.
 In March a military court in Pleven sentenced two policemen to 8-month sus-
 Ended sentences and 3 years' probation for abusing their authority and causing
 dily mijuries to two Romani juveniles in April 1995. This was the first time that
 Rolicemen were sentenced to jail (although the sentence was suspended) for abusing
 ma
 A European human rights organization concluded in a September 1995 report
 that criminal suspects arrested by the police run a significant risk of being mis-
 treated at the time of their apprehension or while in police custody and on occasion
 may be subject to severe mistreatment or torture.
 An Amnesty International (AI) report released in June described 7 deaths in cus-
 tody under suspicious circumstances, 3 incidents in which 6 persons were shot with-
 out sufficient provocation, 17 cases of torture, and the mistreatment of dozens of vic-
 tims spannin a period from 1993 to the date of the report's release. The report con-
 cluded  that the recurring incidence of abuses revealed "a pattern of casual violence
 and illegal acts by plice officers throughout the countr. The Government in re-
 sponse looked into the cases raised by Al, reported on the results of inquiries into
 16 of the cases, and expressed readiness to cooperate with AI. In October AI urged
 prvision of additional information, noting that the information provided was "insuf-
 fiient to assess whe  r these investigations have been prompt and impartial."
 A Human Rights Watch report documenting police mistreatment of Romani street
 children stated that lice harass and physically abuse the children. Children de-
 scribed being chased, kicked, and gabbed by police on the street.
 Conditions in some prisons are harsh, including severe overcrowding, inadequate
 lavatory facilities, and insuffcient heating and ventilation. Credible sources re-
 ported cases of brutality committed by prison guards against inmates; in some
 cases, prisoners who complained were placed in solitary confinement. The process
 by which prisoners may complaln of substandard conditions or of mistreatment does
 not appear to function.
 The Government cooperated fully with requests by indep  dent observers to mon-
 itor prison conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides for access to
 legal counsel from the time of detention. Police normally obtain a warrant from a
 prosecutor prior to apprehending an individual; otherwise, in emergency cir-
 cumstances judicial authorities must rule on the legality of a detention within 24
 hours. Defendants hav e   right to visits by family members, to examine evidence,
 and to know the charges against them. Charges may not be made public without
 the permission of the chief prosecator. Pretn al detention is imited to 2 months
 under normal circumstances, although this may be extended to 6 months by order
 of the Chief Prosecutor, who may a]o restart the process. In practice, persons are
 ofen detained for well over 6 months.
 Nearly 4,000 of approximately 10,000 prison inmates are in pretrial detention. In
 the event of a conviction, time spent in pretrial detention is credited toward the sen-
 tence. The Constitution provides for bail, and some detainees have been released
 under this prevision, although bal is not widely used.
 A Human Rights Watch report found that lpolie often arbitrarily detain street
 children, hold them in custdy, question them, and then release them aiter register-
 iag the children with the Children's Pedagogic Office or referring them to a local
 Commission, the body which is autorized under the Juvenile Delinquency Act to
 recommend confinement of a child in a Labor Education School"
 
 
 879
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.Under the Constitution the judiciary is granted
 independent and coequal status with the legislature and executive branch. However,
 most observers agreed that the judiciary continued to struggle with problems such
 as low salaries, understaffing, and a heavy backlog of cases. Partly as a legacy of
 communism and partly because of the court systems structural and personnel prob-
 lems, most citizens have little confidence in their judicial system Human rights
 groups complain that local prosecutors and magistrates sometimes fail to pursue
 vigorously crimes committed against minorities. Few organized crime figures have
 been prosecuted.
 The court system consists of regional courts the Constitutional Court, and, until
 the end of 1996, an interim Supreme Court. he Government had not yet carried
 out several of the reforms provided for in a 1994 judicial reform bill, including the
 establishment of separate supreme courts of cassation (civil and criminal appeal)
 and admini tration. The failure to establish these courts led to a :political confronta-
 tion between the Supreme Judicial Council and the ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party.
 In June the Supreme Judicial Council elected presidents for the two courts. The
 BSP-controlled Parliament retaliatedby passing legislation prohibiting the Supreme
 Judicial Council from electing presidents, vice presidents, and judges of the two
 courts until Parliament passes legislation establishing them. In October the Con-
 stitutional Court declared this prohibition unconstitutional, and the supreme courts
 of cassation and administration were constituted in November.
 The Constitutional Court is empowered to rescind legislation it considers uncon-
 stitutional, settle disputes over the conduct of general elections, and resolve conflicts
 over the division of powers between the various branches of government. Military
 courts handle cases involving military personnel and some cases involving national
 security matters. The Constitutional Court does not have specific jurisdiction in
 matters of military justice.
 Judges are appointed by the 25-member Supreme Judicial Council and, after serv-
 iag for 3 years, may not be replaced except under limited, specified circumstances.
 The 12 justices on the Constitutional Court are chosen for 9-year terms as follows:
 a third are elected by the National Assembly, a third appointed by the President,
 and a third elected by judicial authorities.
 The Constitution stipulates that all courts shall conduct hearings in public unless
 the proceedings involve state security or national secrets. There were no reported
 complaints about limited access to courtroom proceedings. Defendants have the
 right to know the charges against them and are given ample time to prepare a de-
 fense. The right of appeal is guaranteed and widely use. Defendants in criminal
 proceedings have the right to confront witnesses and to have an attorney, provided
 by the state if necessary, in serious cases.
 A Human Rights Watch report likened the Labor Education Schools to which
 problem children can be sent to penal institutions. However, since the schools are
 not considered prisons under the law, the procedures by which children are confined
 in these schools are not subject to minimal due process. Children sometimes appear
 despite the requirement that parents must attend hearings; the right to an attorney
 at the hearing is expressly prohibited by law. Decisions on these cases are not sub-
 ject to judicial review and children typically stay in the Labor Education Schools
 for 3 years or until they reach majority age, whichever occurs first. At year's end
 the Parliament enacted legislation providing for court review of sentencing to such
 schools, setting a limit of a 3-year stay, and addressing other problems in these in-
 stitutions (see Section 5, Children).
 A number of criminal cases against former leaders for alleged abuses during the
 Communist period were carried forward. Former dictator Todor Zhivkov, who was
 serving a 7-year sentence under house arrest for abuse of power involving ersonal
 expense accounts and state privileges was acquitted in February by the Suprenme
 Court. The Court ruled that Zhivkov ias immunity from prosecution for the crimi-
 nal charges in this case. Zhivkov remains under house arrest for his indictment on
 other charges stemming from his involvement in the coercive campaign to rename
 and assimilate ethnic Turks in the mid-1980's, channeling funds to arm third-world
 countries, and establishing a fund to assist leftist workers' organizations worldwide.
 In April the Prosecutor General's office suspended the investigation of the case
 in which 43 former high-level Communists were indicted in 1994 for having given
 grant aid during the 1980's to then-friendly governments in the developing world
 such as Cuba, Angola, and Libya. The Prosecutor General's office also suspended the
 investigation of a case begun in 1993 involving a charge of embezzlement for giving
 grant aid to Communist parties in other countries (the 'Moscow case"). According
 to the prosecutor's office, the cases were suspended because many of the accused
 have immunity as deputies for the BSP. Some human rights observers criticized
 
 
 880
 
 these and previous indictments, aserting that the activities in question were politi-
 cal and economic in nature, not criminal.
 One of the primary figures in these cases, former Prime Minister and one-time
 senmor Communist official Andrei Lukanov, brought a complaint against these pro-
 ceedings to the European Commission of Human Rights. In March the Commission
 ruled that the detention of Lukanov from July to December 1992 was unlawful. The
 Eur       Court of Human Rights is now considering the case, although Lukanov
 was shot and killed in Sofia on October 2.
 There was no progres in a case begun in 1993 relating to the forced assimilation
 and expulsion of ethnic Turks in 1984--85 and 1989, nor in a trial relating to the
 noto rious death camps set up by the Communists after they came to power m 1944.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prvides for the inviolability of the home and the right to choose one's
 place of work and residence and protects the freedom and confidentiality of cor-
 respondence. Human rights observers expressed concern that illegal wiretaps may
 still persist but provided no tangible evidence. In November the opposition Union
 of Democratic Fores charged that its headquarters had been wiretapped by the In-
 terior Ministry during the fall presidential elections. The Ministry demed the charge
 but ordered an inquiry; the military prosecutor's office began investigating the
 charges.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speeh and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of spech
 and the press, and the Government generally respects this right in practice. ow-
 ever, in September Parliament passed, over President Zhelev's veto, legislation that
 was publicly criticized by Council of Europe experts and Bulgarian journalists for
 the inhibitions it would impose on freedom of the broadcast media. Critics of the
 media law were concerned, for example, that the makeup of the National Council
 for Radio and Television would subject the media to political influence by the part
 in power. Asked by 74 opposition Members of Parliament to rule on the law, the
 Consitutional Court in N  tve r declared this and numerous other provisions un-
 constitutional. Until a revised bill is enacted, the broadcast media are left in a legis-
 lative void.
 The variety of newspapers published by political parties and other organizations
 represents the full spectrum of politicalopinion, although ournalists frequently
 color their reports to conform  with the views of the political parties or economic
 groupa that own their respective newspapers.
 In June the chief editor of the tabloid newspaper Noshten Trud was convicted of
 libeling the Prosecutor General in a June 1995 article. The editor was given a 3-
 month suspended sentence and 3 years' probation. Two journalists, correspondents
 for the national dailies Trud and 24 Hours in Smolan, were arrested in February
 and charged with "libel against a government offical for writing unflattering re-
 ports about a local prosecutor. After spending a night in jail, the journalists were
 released by order of a local court. However, the official investigation against the two
 remains open. Some human rights observers charged that prosecutors, especially
 those in smaller towns, use their authority to issue arrest warrants to intimidate
 reporters who criticize their work.
 Pending the new media legislation, national television and radio broadcasting
 bth remained under parliamentary supervision. Some media observers expressed
 concern that such parliamentary supervision fosters censorship and a lack of bal-
 ance in the state-controlled media, For example, on new year's eve 1995, the direc-
 tor of national television canceled the broadcast of a comedy program claiming that
 the show was disrespectful of political institutions. In June an agreement to give
 live coverage of the "no to fear" concert and rally held in downtown Sofia was
 abruptly canceled the day before, allegedly on the orders of a high-ranking govern-
 ment official.
 There are two state-owned national television channels that broadcast in Bul-
 garian. There is also a national channel that broadcasts Russian programmin , and
 another that carries a mixture of Cable News Network International and French
 language programming. Bulgarian national television has been planning Turkish-
 language programming for at least 3 years, but broadcasts have not yet begun.
 There is no private national broadcaster, but a number of privately owned regional
 stations operate. After initial government approval in the fall of 1994 of an applica-
 tion to create a privately owned national broadcast television station, further
 progress has floundered, with no action taken by the current Government.
 Foreign government radio programs such as the British Broadcasting Corporation
 and the Voice of America (VOA) had good access to commercial radio frequencies.
 
 
 However, a request by Radio Free Europe (RFE) to broadcast Voice of America pro-
 grams on what was unused time on its frequency has not been granted and remains
 in limbo many months after the formal request was submitted. Television and radio
 news programs on the state-owned media present opposition views, but opposition
 members claim that their activities and views are given less sir time and exposure
 thsn the those of the ruling party. There are no formal restrictions on programming.
 Both television and radio provide a variety of news and public interest program-
 ruing, including talk and public opinion shows.
 More than 30 independent radio stations are licensed. Some private stations com-
 plained that their licenses unduly restricted the strength of their transmissions in
 comparison with state-owned stations. Radio transmitter facilities are owned by the
 Government.
 Private book publishing remained vigorous.
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right to peaceful assembly
 is provided for by the Constitution, and the Government generally respected this
 right in practice. The authorities require permits for rallies and assemblies held out-
 doors, but most legally registered organizations were routinely granted permission
 to assemble. However, Jehovah's Witnesses reported difficulties obtaining permits
 for outdoor assemblies, and they and Word of Life also had difficulty renting assem-
 bly halls. In most cases, these religious groups had been denied registration by the
 Council of Ministers (see Section 2.c.). In September, at the behest of some Plovdiv
 residents, municipal officials issued and carried out an order to close a Pentacostal-
 Charismatic Church that was an outgrowth of the Bible Faith Center Immanuel
 founded in 1990 by Pastor Ivan Nestorov. On two separate occasions, members of
 the Word of Life were coerced by police into signing a declaration that they would
 not receive in their homes gatherings of church members.
 Vigorous political rallies and demnstrations were a common occurrence and took
 place without government interference.
 The Government has undertaken to respect the rights of individuals and groups
 freely to establish their own political parties or other political organizations. How-
 ever, there are constitutional and statutory restrictions that limit the right of asso-
 ciation and meaningful participation in the political process. For example, the Con-
 stitution forbids the formation of political parties along religious, ethnic or racial
 lines, and prohibits "citizens' associations from engaging in political activity. None-
 theless, the mainly ethnic Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) is
 represented in Parliament. The other major political parties generally accept the
 MRF's right to participate in the political process. In December, however, a group
 of parliamentarians within the Socialist-led coalition filed a challenge to the MRFUs
 constitutionality, based on MRF programs and goals that allegedly threatened Bul-
 garia's territorial integrity and national unity (see below). The Constitutional Court
 rejected their petition as inadmissible.
 The Constitution also prohibits organizations that threaten the country's terri-
 torial integrity or unity, or that incite racial, ethnic, or religious hatred. The Gov-
 ernment has refused since 1990 to register a self-proclaimed Macedonian rights
 group, Umo-Dlinden, on the grounds that it is separatist. In February and May, po-
 lice broke up attempts by the group to hold public meetings. On May 14, the group
 was denied registration as an educational organization in the city of Blagoevrad.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom of reli-
 gion, the Government restricts this right in practice for some non-Orthodox religious
 groups, and discrimination against them increased. The ability of a number of reli-
 gious groups to operate freely continued to come under attack, both as a result of
 government action and because of public intolerance. The government requirement
 that groups whose activities have a religious element register with the Council of
 Ministers remained an obstacle to the activity of some religious groups, such as Je-
 hovah's Witnesses and Word of Life, which have been denied registration. Despite
 several applications, no new religious denominations were registered in 1996. The
 Government provides financial support for the Eastern Orthodox Church and other
 denominations it considers to be "traditional."
 Dozens of articles in a broad range of newspapers depicted lurid and inaccurate
 pictures of the activities of non-Orthodox religious groups, attributing suicides of
 teenagers and the breakup of families to their activities.
 The Government refused most requests for visas and residence permits for foreign
 missionaries, and some of them came under physical attack in the street and in
 their homes. Members of the Mormon church reported continued acts of harassment
 and assault, including some perpetrated by the police themselves. The police re-
 sponse was indifferent despite the expressed concern of the Government about such
 
 
 cases. Missionaries of Jehovah's Witnesses also reported an incident of beating by
 the police.
 In December 1995, a Jehovah's Witness mother living in a Asenovgrad was denied
 custody of her son solely because of her religious beliefs. The woman has appealed
 to the Supreme Court.
 In late 1995, Jehovah's Witnesses brought a complaint to the European Commis-
 sion of Human Rights about the Government's refusal to register the organization.
 In January the Commission ruled that Jehovah's Witnesses appeal was admissible
 before the Commission, but it has not yet issued a decision on the merits of the
 case.
 On several occasions the police shut down religious meetings of unregistered
 groups. In June the police broke up a Jehovah's Witness meeting at a public dance
 hail in Asenovgrad and confiscated religious material. In August the police raided
 a private hall in Sofia and closed down a meeting of Word of Life. The press was
 on hand and gave wide coverage to both of the police raids. These incidents give
 credence to charges by human rights activists that the police are monitoring the ac-
 tivities of certain unregistered groups.
 The Constitution designates Eastern Orthodox Christianity as the "traditional" re-
 ligion. Along with the Orthodox Church, a number of major religious bodies, includ-
 ing the Muslim and Jewish communities, receive government financial support.
 There was no evidence that the Government discriminated against members of any
 religious group in making restitution to previous owners properties that were na-
 tionalized during the Communist regime. For most registered religious groups there
 were no restrictions on attendance at religious services or on private religious in-
 struction. A school for imams, a Muslim cultural center, university theological fac-
 ulties, and religious primary schools operated freely. Bibles and other religious ma-
 terials in the Bulgarian language were freely imported and printed, and Muslim,
 Catholic, and Jewish publications were published on a regular basis. Nevertheless,
 there were reports that police confiscated religious books and cassettes during
 searches of Word of Life members.
 During compulsory military service most Muslims are placed into construction
 units where they often perform commercial or maintenance work rather than serve
 in normal military units. The mainly ethnic-Turkish Movement for Rights and Free-
 doms (MRF) protested this practice (see Section 5).
 A significant proportion of Muslims considered the Government's continued rec-
 ognition of the 1994 statutes on the Muslim faith and of Nedim Gendjev as Chief
 Mufti and head of the Supreme Theological Council to be government interference
 in the affairs of the community. The Government continued to refuse to recognize
 the election of a rival Chief Mufti, Fikri Salli, who was elected at an alternative
 Islamic conference in March 1995. In 1995 Fikri appealed the Government's action
 unsuccessfully to the Supreme Court.
 The Government's Directorate of Religious Affairs hired Boncho Asenov, a formner
 security official during the Communist regime. Reiable sources report that Asenov
 participated in repressive activities against the ethnic Turkish minority and reli-
 gious groups before 1989.
 By order of the Minister of Education, a private religious elementary school lo-
 cated in Loveteh was closed on August 6. The "School of Tomorrow" was run by the
 registered evangelical denomination, "Shalom" (this group is distinct from the Jew-
 ish community organization of the same name). According to Shalom, the school was
 part of a network of similar schools, founded by an American citizen and associated
 with several Protestant churches, in 108 countries.
 At the Department of Theology of Sofia University all students are required to
 present a certificate of baptism from the Orthodox Church, and married couples
 must present a marriage certificate from the same in order to enroll in the Depart-
 ment's classes; in July two non-Orthodox applicants were denied admission to the
 Department when they were unable to present such certificates. The applicants
 have appealed to the local courts.
 The schism that opened in the Orthodox Church in 1992 deepened, and the Gov-
 ernment refused to recognize an alternative Patriarch elected by supporters in July.
 The Supreme Court ruled that the decision was unlawful, but the alternate Patri-
 arch remained unregistered.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement within the country
 and the right to leave it, and these rights are not limited in practice, with the excep-
 tion of limited border zones that are off limits both to foreigners and citizens not
 resident therein. Every citizen has the right to return to Bulgaria, may not be forc-
 ibly expatriated, and may not be deprived of citizenship acquired by birth. A num-
 
 
 883
 ber of former political emigrants were granted passports and returned to visit or
 live.
 As provided under law, a prosecutor restricted foreign travel by several activists
 of Umio-Ilinden (see Section 2.b.) due to an investigation into their activities. The
 activists complained that the investigation was inactive and that the travel restric-
 tions were being used punitively. A human rights oranization took up the case and
 successfully appealed the travelrestrictions  a higher rankin prosecutor. Observ-
 ers criticized the lack of time limits on such inactive or "suspended" investigations.
 Bulgaria has pro visions for granting asylum or refugee status in accordance with
 the standards of the relevant U.N. acts in this field, and the Government provides
 first asylum. However, domestic and international human rights organizations ex-
 pressed concern over the Government's handling of asylum claims and reported that
 there may be cases in which bona fide refugees are forced to return to countries
 where they fear persecution. The Bureau for Territorial Asylum and Refugees as-
 serts that it gives a fair hearing to all persons seeking asylum or refugee status but
 admits that there may be cases which do not come to its attention before the appli
 cant is returned to the country from which he entered Bulgaria. The Ministry of in-
 terior reports that 2,600 people were denied entry at borders over the past few
 years; it is not known how many of these requested asylum.
 The Bureau reports that 1,506 people have applied for asylum or refugee status
 in the past 3 years; 203 applicants were approved and 28 denied. Domestic and
 international human rights organizations complained that the asylum process is
 slow, and many of those who have been granted refugee status have yet to receive
 the necessary documents enabling them to move about freely and work. The Bureau
 is still seeking to establish registration and reception centers blocked in 1994 by
 skinheads an local citizens groups and has identified some new sites for the cen-
 ters.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government and head of state through the
 election of the President and of the members of the National Assembly, although
 the constitutional prohibition of parties formed on ethnic, racial, or religious lines
 has the effect of circumscribing access to the political process for some groups (see
 Section 2.b.). Suffrage is universal at the age of 18. The most recent parliamentary
 elections took place n December 1994. President Zhelev was elected in 1992 in the
 first direct presidential elections. Peter Stoyanov of the UDF, who was selected as
 a candidate in a primary election among opposition parties in June and then won
 presidential elections in the fall of 1996 wilf succeed Zhelev in January 1997.
 There are no restrictions in law on the participation of women in government. A
 number of women hold elective and appointive office at high levels, including a cabi-
 net-level post and several key positions in Parliament. Women hold about 13 per-
 cent of the seats in the current Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigations of Alleged V'wlations of Human Rights
 Local and international human rights groups operate freely, investigating and
 publishing their findings on human rihts cases. local human rights groups re-
 rted some improvement in their dealings with government officials. The Human
 Rit Project stated that the police regularly answered the group's inquiries and
 have responded positively to a proposal for human rights training of police officers
 in severa cities with large Rma populations. However, government officials, espe-
 cially local officials, are otherwise often reluctant to provide information or active
 cooperation.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for individual rights, euality, and protection against
 discrimination, but in practice discrimination still exists, particularly against Roma
 and women.
 There have been reports of inadequate police response to incidents of violence
 against gays but few victims of such assaults are willing to press charges.
 Women.-omestic abuse is reportedly a serious and common problem, but there
 are no figures, official or otherwise, on its occurrence. Currently, the law exempts
 from state prosecution certain types of assault if committed by a family member,
 and the Government does not assist in prosecuting crimes of domestic assault unless
 the woman has been killed or permanently injured. The courts prosecute rape, al-
 though it remains an underreported crime because some stigma still attaches to the
 victim. The maximum sentence for rape is 8 years; convicted offenders often receive
 
 
 a lesser sentence or early parole. Police data released in August show that over the
 past 2 years 131 women were killed, 1,243 between the age of 17 and 30 were raped,
 451 were crippled for life, and 236 sustained serious injuries as a result of violence.
 Marital rape is a crime but is rarely prosecuted. Courts and prosecutors tend to
 view domestic abuse as a family rather than criminal problem, and in most cases
 victims of domestic violence take refuge with family or friends rather than approach
 the authorities. No government agencies provide shelter or counseling for such per-
 sons, although there is a private initiative to address the problem.
 Many of the approximately 30 women's organizations are closely associated with
 political parties or have primarily professional agendas. Of those that exist mainly
 to defend women's interests, the two largest are the Women's Democratic Union in
 Bul ara, heir to the _roup which existed under the Communist dictatorship, and
 the Bulgarian Women s Association, which disappeared under communism but has
 now reemerged and has chapters in a number of cities.
 The Constitution forbids privileges or restrictions of rights on the basis of sex.
 However, women face discrimination both in terms of recruitment and the likelihood
 of layoffs. Official figures show the rate of unemployment for women to be higher
 than that for men. Women are much more likely than men to be employed in low-
 wage jobs requiring little education, although statistics show that women are equal-
 ly likely to attend university. Women, in the main, continue to have primary respon-
 sibility for child rearing and housekeeping even if they are employed outside the
 home. There are liberal provisions for paid maternity leave. However, in some cases
 these may actually work against employers' willingness to hire and retain female
 employees, especially in the private sector.
 Children.-he Government is generally ommitted to protecting children's wel-
 fare but, with limited resources, falls short in several areas. It maintains, for exam-
 ple, a sizable network of orphanages throughout the country. However, many of the
 orphanages are in disrepair and lack proper facilities. Government efforts in edu-
 cation and health have been constrained by serious budgetary limitations and by
 outmoded social care structures. The Constitution provides that school attendance
 is mandatory until the age of 16. Groups that exist to defend the rights of children
 charge that an increasing number of children are at serious risk as social insurance
 payments fall further behind inflation and are often disbursed as much as 6 months
 late.
 Credible sources report that there is no provision for due process of law for
 Romani and other juveniles when they are detained in labor education schools run
 by the Ministry of Education. Living conditions at these reform schools are poor, of-
 fering little medical, educational, or social opportunities. Generally, staff members
 at these institutions lack the proper qualifications and training to adequately care
 for the children. Degrading and severe punishment, such as the shaving of a child's
 head, reduction in diet, severe beatings, and long periods of solitary confinement,
 are common at the schools. The Ministry of Education (MOE) acknowledges prob-
 lems at the schools, attributing the cause to a lack of funding. At the end of the
 year, Parliament enacted legislation providing for court review of sentencing to such
 schools and addressing other problems in the reform school system.
 The vast majority of children are free from societal abuse, although some Romani
 children are frequent targets of skinhead groups; the homeless or abandoned were
 particularly vulnerable. Some Romani minors were forced into prostitution by family
 or community members. There was little police effort to address these problems. The
 new legislation calls for the establishment of shelters for homeless children.
 People With Disabilities.-Disabled persons receive a range of financial assistance
 including free public transportation, reduced prices on modified automobiles, and
 free equipment such as wheelchairs. However, as in other areas, budgetary con-
 straints mean that such payments have fallen behind. Disabled individuals have ac-
 cess to university training and to housing and employment, although no special pro-
 grams are in place to allow them to live up to their full employment potential. To
 date little effort has been made at the national level to change building or street
 layouts to help blind or otherwise physically disabled persons. The city of Varna al-
 located money for the installation of approximately 150 wheelchair ramps (curb
 cuts) in the city center.
 At the end of 1995, Parliament passed legislation requiring the relevant ministry
 and local  vernments to provide a suitable living and architectural environment for
 the disabld within3 years. However, there is a moratorium on the law taking ef-
 fect until the Ministry of Construction has completed issuing new construction
 standards that more fully take into account the needs of the disabled. Policies of
 the Communist regime which separated mentally and physically disabled persons,
 including very young children, from the rest of society have persisted.
 
 
 885
 NationallRPacllEthnic Minoritles.-Ethnic Turks comprise about 10 percent of
 the ppulation. Although estimates of the Romani population vary widely, several
 experts put it aabout 6 percent. (Bulgran Muslims or "Pomaks" are a distinct
 group oiSlavic descent, comprising 2 to 3 percent of the population, whose ancestors
 converted from Orthodox Chrstianity to Islam. Most are Muslim, although a num-
 ber have become atheists or converted to Christianity.) These are the country's two
 largest minorities. There are no restrictions on the speaking of Turkish in public
 or the use of non-Slavic names.
 Voluntary Turkish-language classes in public schools, funded by the Government,
 continued in areas with signmfcant Turkish-speaking populations, although some ob-
 servers complained that the Government was discouraging the optional language
 classes in areas with large concentrations of BulgarianMilsims. According to the
 Ministry of Education (MOE), there are 844 Turkish Iana    teachers for 64000
 children who study Turkish as their mother tongue. The MOE has reached an
 agreement with the Turkish Government to send teachers to study at Turkish uni-
 versities; 30 such teachers participated in a training ourse over the summer. Some
 ethnic Turkish leaders, mainly in the MRF, demanded that Turkish-language
 schooling be made compulsory in ethnic Turkish areas, but the Government resisted
 this.
 In the 1992 census approximately 3.4 percent of the population identified itself
 as Romani. The real figure is probably about twice that high, since many persons
 of Romani descent tend to identify themselves to the authorities as ethnic Turks or
 Bulgarians. Romani groups continued to be divided among themselves, although
 several groups had some success presenting Romani issues to the Government. As
 individuals and as an ethnic group, Roma faced high levels of discrimination.
 Attacks by private citizens on Homani communities continued to occur. In April
 seven teenars beat and stabbed to death Anguel Ivanov, a Roma, in the city of
 Shumen. While there were no witnesses to the attack, the victim was able to iden-
 tify his attackers before dying. An investigation is in progress. In June a group of
 young men attacked and beat three Roma in the town of Samokov. Two of the vic-
 tims suffered numerous injuries and were knocked unconscious. Local Roma told a
 human rights organization that skinhead attacks were common in the town, and the
 police did nothing to stop them. In January at the central rail station in Sofia, a
 group of skinheacs attacked several homeless Roma children sleeping at the station.
 One of the victims was stabbed three times. Several witnesses reported that the po-
 lice arrested some of the attackers, but later released them. Roma children living
 at the station allege that they are frequently attacked by skinheads and occasionally
 by police officers. No charges have been filed in the 1994 and 1995 cases of attacks
 by private citizens on two Romani communities. Authorities often fail to aggres-
 sively investigate cases of assault or other crimes against Roma, although there was
 some improvement in their responsiveness to inquiries of human rights organiza-
 tions (see Section 4).
 Roma encounter difficulties applying for social benefits, and rural Roma are dis-
 couraged from claiming land to which they are entitled under the law disbanding
 agricultural collectives. Many Roma and other observers made credible allegations
 that the quality of education offered to Romani children is inferior to that afforded
 most other students.
 The Government admitted that it has been largely unsuccessful in attracting and
 keeping many Romani children in school, but it stated that improved education for
 these children is a government priority. The MOE, together with UNESCO, started
 seven pilot schools designed specifically for Romani children. The schools have had
 good results, but because of financial constraints the MOE is unable to expand the
 program. The MOE continued its program to introduce Romani-language school-
 books into schools with Romani populations and issued follow-on textbooks for the
 program. The program has had mixed success, partly due to a lack of qualified
 teachers.
 Workplace discrimination against minorities continued to be a problem, especially
 for Roma. Employers justify such discrimination on the basis that most Roma have
 relatively low training and education. Supervisory jobs are generally given to ethnic
 Bulgarian employees, with ethnic Turks, Bulgarian Muslims, and Roma among the
 first to be laid off. The National Employment Office is responsible for two programs
 designed to improve education, training, and labor market participation: an ongoing
 literacy and training program in ethnically mixed regions; and, with foreign assist-
 ance, a "from social assistance to employment" program aimed at reducing the num-
 ber of persons receiving social assistance, many of whom are Turkish or Roma.
 During ompulsory military service most Roma (and Muslims-see Section 2.c.)
 are shunted into units where they often perform commercial, military construction,
 or maintenance work rather than serve in normal military units. The MRF pro-
 
 
 886
 tested this practice, as did human rights groups and labor observers who cited it
 as a violation of International Labor Organization (ILO) accords. There are only a
 few ethnic Turkish and Romani officers in the military.
 Thousands of Bulgarians, mainly in the southwest identify themselves as Mac-
 edonians, most for historical and geographic reasons. Members of the two organiza-
 tions that purport to defend their interests, Umo-Ilinden and Tmo-Ilinden, are be-
 lieved to number in the hundreds (see Section 2.b.).
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1991 Constitution provides for the right of all
 workers to form or join trade unions of their own choice, and this right was appar-
 ently freely exercised. Estimates of the unionized share of the work force range from
 30 to 50 percent. This share is shrinking as large firms lay off workers, and most
 new positions appear in small, nonunionized businesses.
 There are two large trade union confederations, the Confederation of Independent
 Trade Unions of Bulgaria (CITUB), and Podkrepa. CITUB, the successor to the
 trade union contrlle-y the former Communist regime, operates as an independent
 entity. Podkrepa, an independent confederation created in 1989, was one of the ear-
 liest opposition forces but is no lon er a member of the Union of Democratic Forces,
 the main oppositionparty. In 199b a third trade union confederation, the Commu-
 nity of Free Union Organizations in Bulgaria (CFOUB), was admitted to the Na-
 tional Tripartite Coordination Council (NTCC), which includes employers and the
 Government (see Section 6.b.).
 The 1992 Labor Code recognizes the right to strike when other means of conflict
 resolution have been exhausted, but "political strikes" are forbidden. Workers in es-
 sential services are prohibited from striking, in September the Constitutional Court
 ruled that this prohibition is constitutional. There was no evidence that the Govern-
 ment interfered with the right to strike, and several work stoppages took place. The
 Labor Code's prohibitions against antiunion discrimination include a 6-month period
 of protection against dismissal as a form of retribution. While these provisions ap-
 pear to be within international norms, there is no mechanism other than the courts
 for resolving complaints, and the burden of proof in such a case rests entirely on
 the employee.
 In 1993 the ILO requested further information on lustration proceedings, meas-
 ures directed at compensating ethnic Turks for abuses under the previous regime,
 efforts taken to improve the economic situation of minorities, and measures to pro-
 mote equality between men and women in workplace opportunity. At year's end, the
 ILO was still reviewing the information provided to it by the Government.
 There are no restrictions on affiliation or contact with international labor organi-
 zations, and unions actively exercise this right.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiuely.-The Labor Code institutes
 collective bargaining, which was practiced nationally and on a local level. The legal
 prohibition against striking for key public sector employees weakens their bargain-
 ing position; owever, these groups were able to influence negotiations by staging
 protests and engaging in other pressure activities without going on strike. Both
 C1TUB and P       pa complained that while the legal structure or collective bar-
 gaining was adequate, many employers failed to bargain in good faith or to adhere
 to concluded agreements. Labor observers viewed the Government's enforcement of
 labor contracts as inadequate.
 Only the three labor members of the National Tripartite Cooperation Council are
 authorized to bargain collectively. This restriction led to complaints by smaller
 unions, which may in individual work places have more members than the NTCC
 members. Smaller unions also protested their exclusion from the NTCC. Podkrepa
 and CITUB walked out of the NTCC several times, charging that the -Government
 was failing to negotiate in good faith. The Government acknowledges that the Coun-
 cil's record was inconsistent.
 There were no instances in which an employer was found guilty of antiunion dis-
 crimination and required to reinstate workers fired for union activities. Inter-
 national labor organizations criticized the "national representation" requirement for
 participation in the NTCC as a violation of the right to organize.
 The same obligation of collective bargaining and adherence to labor standards
 prevails in the export processing zones, and unions may organize workers in these
 areas.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor. Many observers argued that the practice of shunting minority
 and conscientious-objector military draftees into work units that often carry out
 commercial construction and maintenance projects is a form of compulsory labor
 (Section 5).
 
 
 887
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code sets the minimum
 age for employment at 16 years of age; the minimum age for dangerous work is set
 at 18 years old. Employers and the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare (MISW)
 are responsible for enforcing these provisions. Child labor laws are enforced well in
 the fornal sector. Underage employment in the informal and agricultural sectors is
 increasing as collective farms are broken up and the private sector continues to
 grow. In addition, children work on family-owned tobacco farms.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The national monthly min'mum wage was ap-
 proximately $24 (5,500 leva) effective October 1. The minimum wage is not enough
 to provide a wage earner and family with a decent standard of living. The Constitu-
 tion stipulates the right to social security and welfare aid assistance for the tempo-
 rarily unemployed, although in practice such assistance is often either late or not
 disbursed.
 The Labor Code provides for a standard workweek of 40 hours with at least one
 24-hour rest period per week. The MISW is responsible for enforcing both the mini-
 mum wage and the standard workweek. Enforcement has been generally effective
 in the state sector (although there are reports that state-run enterprises fall into
 arrears on salary payments to their employees if the firms incur losses) but is weak-
 er in the emerging private sector.
 A national labor safety program exists, with standards established by the Labor
 Code. The Constitution states that employees are entitled to healthy and non-
 hazardous working conditions. The MISW is responsible for enforcing these provi-
 sions. Under the Labor Code, employees have the right to remove themselves from
 work situations that present a serious or immediate danger to life or health without
 jeopardizing their continued employment. In practice, refusal to work in situations
 with relatively high accident rates or associated chronic health problems would re-
 sult in loss of employment for many workers. Conditions in many cases are worsen-
 ing owing to budget stringencies and a growing private sector that labor inspectors
 do not yet supervise effectively.
