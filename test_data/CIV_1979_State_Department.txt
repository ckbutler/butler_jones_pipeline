 IVORY COAST
 The Ivorian one-party system is based on a broad consen-
 sus supporting the goals and methods of Ivory Coast's socio-
 economic development. This consensus has been reinforced
 by the political skills of President Houphouet-Boigny and
 the Ivorian leadership, by dialogue within the sole political
 party, the Democratic Party of Ivory Coast, and by the widely
 shared perception that the Ivorian standard of living con-
 tinues to improve.
 Although Ivory Coast remains a developing country in which
 the vital needs of some of its people are not fulfilled, its
 economic growth has permitted appreciable improvement in the
 standard of living. In keeping with its President's emphasis
 on dialogue, Ivory Coast often seeks to involve dissenters in
 the operation of the system, rather than to isolate or impri-
 son them. The Government of Ivory Coast has expressed sup-
 port for human rights and has welcomed the human rights poli-
 cies of the United States. Its delegation to the United
 Nations Commission on Human Rights has cooperated with our
 delegation. During 1979, the Government continued its sup-
 port for human rights in international fora, playing a par-
 ticularly noteworthy role in the growing African attention
 to human rights issues on the continent.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law, is contrary to Ivorian custom,
 and is not condoned by the Government. There have been no
 reports of torture in Ivory Coast.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although capital punishment is not legally prohibited,
 it has not been used since independence. Police and
 other government officials do not treat individuals or
 prison inmates in an exceedingly cruel, inhuman or degrad-
 ing manner. Prisoners are allowed visits from family
 members and attorneys of their choice. The poor, particu-
 larly if they are foreign Africans, are occasionally treated
 roughly. Prison conditions are poor. Prisoners rely on
 family or friends to supplement a sparse prison diet and to
 provide other basic needs.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The Ivorian Constitution and pertinent statutes prohibit
 arbitrary arrest or imprisonment, and in practice they
 rarely occur. However, the Government takes firm measures,
 including detention, to suppress public protests or acts it
 considers threats to internal security. For example, in
 early 1977 the Government briefly detained about 1400
 students who organized or participated in demonstrations.
 The Government also occasionally detains individuals it
 believes may be security threats. According to the Ivorian
 
 
 94
 penal code, anyone arrested must be brought before a prosecu-
 tor or judge within 48 hours. The public prosecutor can
 detain a suspect for up to 48 hours without charging him and
 can obtain further periods of detention of up to four
 months each by order of a judge. A judge who issues such
 an order must provide a monthly written explanation to the
 Minister of Justice of why the detention should be con-
 tinued. According to the Government, there are no politi-
 cal prisoners in Ivory Coast; the Department of State is
 not aware of any. The last known political prisoners were
 given amnesty by President Houphouet-Boigny in 1975.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 As in the French system, the right to a fair public trial
 exists and appears to be respected. In most rural areas,
 however, justice is often administered at the village
 level through traditional tribal institutions.
 Trials vary in length from a few hours to several weeks;
 pre-trial detention may be lengthy. Defendants have the
 right to legal counsel and the Ivorian judicial system
 provides for court-appointed attorneys for indigent defen-
 dants, although in practice such attorneys are not readily
 available.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 In the modern parts of cities, legal safeguards against
 arbitrary searches are respected. In less developed urban
 sectors, legal safeguards are sometimes ignored as a result
 of illiteracy, poorly trained officials and local custom.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The Ivorian economy has developed at an impressive pace,
 though significant income disparities and uneven distri-
 bution of goods and services persist. In some areas,
 such as health, economic growth has not significantly
 mitigated poor conditions. In others, such as housing,
 shortages exist despite significant governmental efforts to
 improve conditions. Parts of the country have not shared
 in the general prosperity as much as have the larger urban
 centers and the areas which produce export crops. On
 balance, however, Ivorian development policies have made
 considerable progress in providing for the basic needs
 of the people. Among the poor, for example, food short-
 ages rarely affect nutrition. The Government spends 30
 to 40 percent of its budget for education. Although
 problems remain, steady progress is being made in reducing
 illiteracy and in transforming a basically French educa-
 tional system to meet Ivorian needs.
 The most important source (nearly 50 percent) of revenues in
 the Government's operating budget is customs duties: tariff
 rates were sharply increased during 1979. As imports are
 largely purchased by wealthy Ivorians and expatriates this
 tax is progressive. When coupled with the personal and
 corporate income tax (approximately 28 percent of revenues
 in the operating budget),  the tax system is progressive
 despite a regressive VAT and increased excise tax on tobacco
 
 
 products and alcoholic beverages. The pattern of taxes
 and public expenditures in the operating budget would
 seem to redistribute income toward lower income persons.
 Corruption does not seem significantly to affect governmental
 development policies. However, mismanagement and ineffi-
 ciency have had an impact on the Government's ability to
 improve living standards. Poor coordination among the
 various ministries, for example, recently led the Government
 to overspend and, subsequently, to cut back on development
 projects.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 In Ivory Coast there is limited freedom of speech and
 virtually complete freedom of religion. There is freedom
 of assembly except when the Government perceives a signif-
 icant and immediate danger to public order. In such cases
 the Government acts firmly and may temporarily detain unruly
 elements. All Ivorian news media are owned or controlled by
 the Ministry of Information. Criticism frequently appears
 on the shortcomings of policy execution, but not on the
 basic policies themselves. Foreign publications are readily
 available, some of which criticize the Ivorian Government,
 the party and the President. The authorities attempt to
 suppress distribution of locally produced anti-government
 literature, but their reaction to its occasional appearance
 is comparatively lenient and often ineffective. During
 1979, for example, 12 Ivorian students who had reported-
 ly distributed tracts calling for the overthrow of the
 Government lost their military deferments and were drafted.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 The Government exercises minimal control over domestic
 travel, i.e., occasional check points outside major urban
 centers where police verify that identification, motor
 vehicle licenses, insurance papers, and other documents are
 in order. Ivorians can freely travel abroad and emigrate.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political participation in Ivory Coast is restricted to
 the single Democratic Party of Ivory Coast. Public crit-
 icism of basic governmental policies or of the President,
 while theoretically permitted, rarely occurs. There is
 considerable popular participation within the party.
 For example, party members, including practically all
 adults, participate at the neighborhood and village level in
 the selection of officers of the local party sub-sections.
 On a few occasions, several candidates have been allowed to
 compete in primary elections for the party nomination to
 municipal offices. Party members also elect local represent-
 atives to meetings of the party sub-section where candidates
 for the national assembly are proposed to the party's
 national political bureau. Presidential and legislative
 elections are held every five years, with a single slate
 approved by universal adult suffrage. Views and complaints
 
 
 96
 on party and governmental officials and needs can be pressed
 through professional and other associations. The President
 meets with these associations and holds extensive and
 candid dialogues to resolve significant or difficult issues.
 Labor unions are closely tied to the Government but have a
 fair degree of freedom in representing worker interests.
 Strikes are not illegal, but the thrust of the labor code
 requires mediation, arbitration and "cooling-off" periods to
 resolve labor disputes.
 Although there are no governmental policies or institutional
 forces which cause, support, or condone either racial or
 sexual discrimination, a degree of prejudice exists against
 some foreign residents. Though some Ivorian traditional
 societies accord women a considerable economic and political
 role, in others women are more restricted. The full partici-
 pation of women in social, economic and political life is
 encouraged by official policy. In 1975 the Ivorian leader-
 ship decided that the number of women deputies in the
 National Assembly would be increased (there are now 11), and
 in 1976 a ministry concerned with women's affairs was
 established with a woman as minister.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The Government of Ivory Coast has been cooperative toward
 an inquiry into its human rights situation; in 1975 Presi-
 dent Houphouet-Boigny personally received a representative
 of Amnesty International. We are not aware of any other
 inquiries regarding human rights in Ivory Coast. During
 1979, Ivory Coast played a key role in the establishment
 and funding of a five-nation commission of African jurists,
 which included an Ivorian, to investigate Amnesty Inter-
 national allegations of massacres of school children
 in the Central African Empire.
