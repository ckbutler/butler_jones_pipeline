 NIGERIA
 Nigeria continued to be ruled by the Federal Military Government of Gerieral
 Ibrahim Babangida who came to ower in a 1985 coup. For almost all of 1992, a
 19-member Armed 'orces Ruhlguncil (AFRC) was Nigeria's main decisionmak-
 ing organ. The AFRC ruled by decree. The executive branch consisted of a 20-mem-
 ber mixed military-civilian Cabinet, the Council of Ministers. On November 17,
 Babangida announced the extension of the transition from January to August 27,
 1993. He also dissolved the AFRC and the Council of Ministers and created a Na-
 tional Defense and Security Council (NDSC) to replace the AFRC, and a Civilian
 Transition Council to manage the day-to-day affairs of government ministries. The
 NDSC and the Transition Council assumed office in the first week of 1993.
 Nigeria's firmly controlled progress toward an elected civilian government was
 dealt a setback in 1992. In response to substantial electoral malpractices in the Au-
 gat presidential primaries, the AFRC scheduled new primaries for September.
 These primaries were also marred by widespread electoral abuses, including vote-
 buying and tampering with official returns. As a result, in October the Government
 nullified all results of the September primaries. The local, state, and national execu-
 tive bodies of the two political parties were disbanded and replaced with govern-
 ment-appointed caretaker committees. In November President Babangida an-
 nounced the banning of all 23 aspirants involved in the failed September primaries
 from further participation in the transition progam and delayed the presidential
 election from December 5, 1992, to June 12, 1993. The inauguration scheduled for
 January 2 1993, is now to be held on August 27, 1993, the eighth anniversary of
 President habangida's accession.
 Elections were held in July for members of the Senate and House of Representa-
 tives. Members-elect were sworn in on December 5, 1992, and will be seated on Jan-
 uary 2, 1993. However, AFRC Decree 53 excludes the legislators from power in all
 significant areas of national life until the inauguration of a civilian president. The
 legislative and failed presidential primary elections were conducted by the con-
 troversial open-ballot system, which requires voters to stand behind the pictures of
 their candidates. Many private citizens, government officials and employees, mem-
 bers of the clergy, and others who are unwilling to be seen openly supporting a
 given candidate or party are effectively disenfranchised by the open-ballot system.
 President Babangida announced in November that this system would be modified
 into an open-secret system for the presidential elections, whereby voters could cast
 their ballots privately while the actual vote tabulation would continue to be con-
 ducted in public.
 The Government enforces its authority throuh the federal security system (the
 military, the State Security Service, and the national police) and through the courts.
 Plans to create a new internal security force, the National Guard. were realized in
 
 
 196
 1992, when personnel were recruited from existing services, and training programs
 were initiated. No National Guard units have yet been deployed. The Guard is in-
 tended to relieve the armed forces of the internal security role in situations where
 local police are incapable of maintaining public order. Total military expenditures
 for 1989, the last year for which the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
 conducted a detailed analysis, were $130 million. Despite participation in the re-
 gional peacekeeping force i Liberia and humanitarian relief operations in Somalia,
 the Government continued its drastic force-level reduction inititated in 1991. How-
 ever, any associated savings will be negated by the establishment of the National
 Guard.
 Most of Nigeria's 90 million population is rural, engaging in small scale agri-
 culture. Nigeria depends on oil exports for over 90 percent of its foreign exchange
 earnings and 80 percent of its budget revenues. In order to cope with reduced oil
 revenues, Nigeria adopted an indigenous Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) in
 1986. The SAP was a success in many respects, but economic conditions for the av-
 erage Nigerian remain difficult. Large budget deficits inanced by money creation
 have pushed inflation into the 60-perent range. While Nigerian elites continue to
 prosper, there is widespread unemployment, underemployment, and inflation. The
 majority of the Nigerian population is in poverty. Economic distress has fueled epi-
 sodic civil unrest in urban areas and probably heightened interethnic violence in
 some rural areas.
 Human rights in Nigeria remained circumscribed; human rights problems in-
 cluded extrajudicial killings, plice brutality, dangerous and unsanitary prison con-
 ditions, arbitrary arrests, violenc and discrimination against women, and infringe-
 ments on freedoms of speech, press, travel, and political and labor affiliation. Mili-
 tary decrees regularly circumvent judicial review and key prvisions of the 1.989
 Constitution. Decree Two of 1984, carrying broad powers of detention, remained in
 force and in use, though several persons held under the decree were released in
 1992. Human rights monitors still faced harassment in the form of arrests and re-
 strictions on travel. Various political associations and a labor union were proscribed
 during the year, and several candidates were banned from seeking office. Communal
 violence and rioting resulted in thousands of deaths in several major disturbances,
 and unhealthful prison conditions led to hundreds of deaths by disease and
 manourishment. There were also reports of forced repatriation of Chadians, many
 of whom were allegedly executed upon their return.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Induding Freedom from
 a. Politica and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Extrajudicial killings and excessive
 use of force by police and security services were again common occurrences in Nige-
 ria in 1992. Perhaps the most highly publicized instance was the September shoot-
 ing death at a Lagos police checkpoint of an army colonel, Domven Rindam. Within
 a ns of he incident, three policemen were arraigned for murder, police and mili-
 tary panels of inquiry were established, and police checkpoints throughout the coun-
 try were dissolved. Earlier, in February mobile police checkpoints had been tempo-
 rarily removed after a police sergeant shot and killed a bus driver in a Lagos sub-
 urb, touching off a minor riot. The sergeant was reportedly dismissed from the force
 and is in detention awaiting trial. The police mobile force, nicknamed "kill-and-go,"
 was manning checkpoints again before the end of the month. In June and July, two
 gasoline tank truck drivers were shot and killed at police checkpoints, sparking
 strikes by sympathizing drivers which resulted in temporary fuel shortages in
 Lags. That same month, mobile policemen were again removed from the streets.
 Sme checkpoints have since been restored, perhaps partly in response to public
 calls for their return.
 Human rights groups and the press reported other instances of police killings, in-
 eluding a commercial motor~clist beaten to death on May 7 in Imo State, a student
 shot during an otherwise peaceful student protest at Lagos State University, acol-
 lege student shot in the back during a secondary school soccer match in Port Har-
 court, a suspect arrested during May riots in Lagos who died in custody at -koyi
 Prison in July, and a Taraba State House of Assembly legislator murdered in June.
 In the latter case, two policemen were arreste d are believed to be in detention
 awaiting trial.
 The Civil Liberties Organization (CLO) reported that nearly 400 bodies had been
 delivered by police to the likeja General Hospital mortuary in the first 9 months of
 1992. While the CLO contends that the majority of the victims were killed at check-
 points or in detention facilities, this remains unsubstantiated, since the cause and
 place of death of the vitimsowe not included in the information provided. The po-
 
 
 lice claim that the bodies were primarily those of accident and murder victims. Nev-
 ertheless, the high number of reported extrajudicial killings by security agents have
 led many, including President Pachal Bafyau of the Nigeria Labour Congress, to
 allege that more persons an killed in Nigeria by the police than by armed robbers.
 Police use of deadly force has been amply illustrated. Between January and July,
 the Delta state Commissioner of Police announced a total of 53 armed robbery sus-
 pects had been killed by police, while over the same period only 41 had been ar-
 rested. Similarly, plice in Benin City announced they had killed 17 robbery sus-
 pects over a 2-week period in April.
 There have been some efforts to make police officials more accountable. A High
 Court judge in Delta State ordered five policemen to appear in June to answer ques-
 tions concerning the deaths of two students in police custody in November 1991. The
 National Association of Democratic Lawyers pursued a civi action against police of-
 ficials implicated in the alleged torture death of Segun Fakayode in December 1991
 (see Section 1.c.). A Lagos High Court justice ordered the arrest of two police officers
 in August for questioning in the death of Bassey Ekong, who had been held without
 trial for 2 years. A police corporal, found guilty of killing a middle-aged man in Imo
 state in 1987, was sentenced to death by a court in July, but the sentence, which
 may be appealed and must be confirmed by the Governor, had not been carried out
 by year's end. Two policemen were dismissed from the force and arraigned in the
 November beating death of the wife of a businessman whose home they were
 searching without a valid warrant. The two men have been remanded to prison.
 Nevertheless many policemen guilty of extrajudicial killings go unpunished and
 unquestioned. bespite the 1990 recommendation by a judicial commission of inquiry
 (into the massacre of approximately 25 villagers in Umuechem, Rivers state) that
 122 policemen be prosecuted for their involvement in the incident, there is no evi-
 dence that any of the accused policemen have been arrested or tried. In fact the
 report listing the names of the policemen involved has never been released. There
 is no evidence of legal action being taken against the officers involved in the murder
 of a family of seven at a police checkpoint at Oka-Oba in March 1991, or against
 officers implicated in the 1991 deaths of Nwogu Okere, Anthony Nnaemeka, Larry
 Igwe, or Segun Fakayode. While senior police officials occasionally remind officers
 of the stiff penalties they may face for excessive force, murder, illegal discharge of
 weapons, or extortion, few police are ever arrested or even disciplined for such of-
 fenses.
 b. Disappearance.-No politically motivated disappearances were reported. Sev-
 eral policemen were reported missing after the September murder of Colonel
 Rindam. Government detention practices have the effect of causing many detainees
 to be "missing" for extended periods (see Section 1.d).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Nigerian law prohibits torture and mistreatment of prisoners, and provides criminal
 sanctions for such excesses. Nevertheless, detainees frequently die while in police
 custody (see Section l.a.), and there are credible reports that suspects are regularly
 beaten and tortured by police seeking to extract confessions. For example, Segun
 Fakayode was arrested in good health in Ondo on December 6, 1991, and held by
 polie until December 11, when they delivered him to a state hospital, where he
 died. His body purportedly showed evidence of severe torture, including numerous
 bruises and a swollen head. In another case Anthony Nnaemeka was arrested on
 January 23, 1992, in Lagos for alleged theft. fie died the same day, reportedly after
 being beaten while hanging naked from an iron rod. Mistreatment of both male and
 femalepisoners by g      and fellow inmates, at the behest or with the consent
 of guar, reportedy occurs often. Citizens are often beaten and harassed at police
 checkpoints, usually in connection with a demand for a bribe by the police, who re-
 main poorly paid and poorly disciplined.
 Conditions in Nigera's prisons remain life-threatening. Lack of potable water and
 sewage facilities, medical supplies, and transportation contribute to deplorable sani-
 tary conditions. Disease runs rampant in the cramped, poorly ventilated, and filthy
 facilities. There were various reports of epidemics in prisons. In the fourth quarter
 of 1991, approximately 30 prisoners died of diseases in Niger State prisons alone.
 A shortage of drugs and equipment was cited as contributing to the problem. The
 diseases included typhoid and kwashiokor (malnutrition). The CLO documented 20
 deaths from tuberculosis and diarrhea between July 1991 and February 1992 in
 Makurdi. Overcrowding is still a serious problem despite ongoing projects to expand
 or rehabilitate prisons. The 40-year-old prison in Enugu (with a recommended ca-
 pacity of 500) currently houses 3,000 prisoners, one-third of whom are still awaiting
 trial. Despite the CLO's estimate in 1991 that some 2,000 inmates die yearly in the
 nation's prisons, the Minister of the Interior told a news conference that the 1991
 figure was closer to 5.000-about 8 nercent of the nrison nonilatinn.
 
 
 198
 In other efforts to deal with the problem, the Government released over 500 pris-
 oners from custody and agreed to separate children living in prison with their moth-
 ers from serious offenders; others are calling on the Government to remove the chil-
 dren from prison completely and put them in foster care. A national committee on
 prison reform continues its study of ways to improve prison conditions.
 d. Arbitrary, Arrest, Detention, or Exie.-Nigerian criminal justice procedures call
 for trial within 3 months of arraignment for most categories of criminals. Inefficient
 administrative procedures, petty extortion, bureaucratic inertia, poor communication
 between police and prison officials, and inadequate transportation result in consid-
 erable delays, often stretching several years, in bringing sus cts to trial. The Min-
 ister of the Interior estimated that approximately 20,000 orNigeria's 60,000 pris-
 oners were awaiting trial; credible estimates from nongovernmental organizations
 put the figure much higher.
 Police officers are empowered to make arrests without warrants if there is reason-
 able suspicion of an offense, or-if they witness the commission of an offense. These
 provisions give police wide and often abused powers to arrest. Under the law, the
 arresting officer must inform the accused of charges at the time of arrest and take
 the person to the station for processing within a reasonable time. The suspect must
 be given the opportunity to engage counsel and obtain bail. Credible reports indicate
 that the police do not generaly adhere to these safeguards. Suspects are often held
 incommunicado under harsh conditions for extended periods without charge. Arbi-
 trary detention, particularly at police checkpoints, occurs frequently. Relatives and
 friends of wanted suspects are also commonly put in detention without charge in
 an effort to induce an accused to present himself or herself to the police.
 The State Security (Detention of Persons) Decree of 1984 (Decree Two) provides
 that the Government may detain without charge persons suspected of acts preju-
 dicial to state security or harmful to the economic well-being of the country. When
 invoked by the Vice President, the Decree suspends the detainee's civil liberties and
 forbids judicial review of actions taken within its provisions. The high courts have
 nevertheless attempted to extend their jurisdiction in Decree Two cases by deter-
 mining whether procedures outlined under Decree Two were proerly observed.
 The Government established a review panel which periodically would submit rec-
 ommendations to the Vice President on the continued incarceration of Decree Two
 detainees. Detentions under this Decree are supposed to be reviewed every 6 weeks,
 though this provision is believed to be regularly ignored. Neither meetings of the
 review panel nor its membership are publicy reported, though the Federal Attorney
 General is known to sit on the panel. The panel reportedly met at least 3 times in
 1992. Many Nigerians still consider Decree Two the main threat to their basic free-
 doms because the judicial ouster clause encourages arbitrary detention by allowing
 officers to make arrests with impunity. Also the definition of what constitutes acts
 prejudicial to state security or the nation's economic well-being can be very broadly
 interpreted. Human rights groups continue to charge that detentions are regularly
 renewed without review. They also contend that persons are sometimes detained
 under Decree Two without a prior order signed by the Vice President. In July a
 Lagos High Court declared illegal the arrest of human rights monitor Beko
 Ransome-Kuti under Decree Two because the detention order was made after his
 arrest.
 Decree Two was used in 1992 to detain and silence persons for antigovernment
 activities or statements. In the aftermath of riots in several Nigerian cities in May
 four human rights monitors and a student union leader were arrested and detained
 under Decree Two. Beko Ransome-Kuti, Femi Falana, and Baba Omojola, all lead-
 ing members of "Campaign for Democracy" (CD), an umbrella human rights organi-
 zation which is openly critical of the Government's closely directed political transi-
 tion program, were arrested in Lagos on May 19. Yet another prominent human
 rights monitor and legal counsel to two of the detainees, Gani Fawehinmi, was ar-
 rested on May 30. Still another human rights monitor, Dr. Osagie Obayuwana, was
 arrested at a police checkpoint in Lagos on May 24, reportedly for being in posses-
 sion of CD literature. He wal released after a few days and was never charged be.
 fore a court. The president of the proscribed National Association of Nigerian Stu-
 dents (NANS) and fellow CD member, Olusegun Maiyegun, was arrested on June
 11. The Government disobeyed several Lagos High Court orders in June that the
 detainees be presented in court to verify their health and whereabouts and to re-
 solve issues concerning their arrests and continued detentions. A court order to re-
 lease Femi Falana on June 8 also went unheeded. The five detainees, who were
 being held incommunicado at Kuje Prison, near Abuja, were subsequently arraigned
 before a magistrate court there on June 15 on charges of "treasonable felony" and
 released on bail on June 29. In October the trial of the five was adjourned to March
 1993. The men remain free on bond.
 
 
 199
 Although the CLO estimates that 25 people remain in custody under Decree Two,
 Vice President Aikhomu announced in March that there were no longer any detain-
 ees under that Decree. He made the announcement shortly after the release from
 custody of 11 relatives of p  sons suspected of involvement in a coup attempt in
 April 1990. All had been held without charge, some for nearly 2 years. Among those
 released was Gloria Mowrin, whose detention was reported last year. Another
 prominent Decree Two detainee, Jennifer Madike, who had been implicated in a
 government corruption scandal in 1991, was released in August.
 There were no known instances of forced exile as a means of political control.
 a. Denial of Fair Public lWaL.-Decree One of 1984, the Basic Constitution (Modi-
 fication and Suspension) Decree, was the first decree promulgated by the military
 officers who overthrew the civilian regime of former President Shehu Shagari on De-
 cember 31,1983. It left the institutional framework of the judiciary branch relatively
 intact, but established a parallel system of military tribunals which were given sole
 jurisdiction over certain offenses, such as coup plotting, corruption, armedrobbey,
 illegal sale of petroleum, or trafficking in narcotics. A decree in 1991 subsequently
 amended Decree One by providing that only sitting or retired civilian judges be al-
 lowed to preside over tribunals hearing nonmilitary cases. The special tribunals and
 the promulgation of decrees that prohibit judicial intervention have weakened judi-
 cial independence in Nigeria.
 In most cases before the tribunals, the accused have the right to legal counsel,
 bail (in many cases), and appeal, though some tribunals substitute a presumption
 of guilt for the presumption of innocence, and conviction rates in the tribunals re-
 prtedly exceed conviction rates in the regular courts. Sentences are generally se-
 vere. Free legal counsel is available through the Legal Aid Council for persons
 charged with capital crimes, but the Council is inadequately funded to provide coun-
 sel for all persons charged with lesser offenses.
 Convictions for armed robbery by the Special Robbery and Firearms Tribunals, as
 well as convictions under the Treason and Other Offenses Tribunal, carry the death
 penalty with no right of judicial appeal. In the case of armed robbery, death sen-
 tences were confirmed by the state governor, while treason convictions had to be
 confirmed by the NDSC. Convictions before the Miscellaneous Offenses Tribunal
 and the Recovery of Public Property Tribunal may not be appealed in the regular
 courts, though there is provision for appeal before the Special Appeals Tribunal.
 The regular court system is composed of beth federal and state trial courts state
 a p peals ourts, the Federal Court ol Appeal, and the Federal Supreme Court. "ourts
 of first instance under the 1989 Constitution include magistrate or district courts,
 customary or area courts, religious or Shari's (Islamic) courts, and, for some speci-
 fled cases, the state high courts. The nature of the case usually determines which
 court has jurisdiction. In principle, customary and Shari'a courts have jurisdiction
 only if beth plaintiff and defendant agree to it, though in practie fear of legal costs,
 delay, and distance to alternative courts encourage many litigants to choose these
 courts. Under the 1989 Constitution, the effective date of which has once again been
 postponed, this time to August 1993, Shari'a courts are limited to followers of Islam
 and to only those states that establish them.
 Trials in the regular court system are public and generally respect constitu-
 tionally guaranteed individual rights. These include a presumption of innocence, the
 right to be present to confront witnesses, to present evidence, and to be represented
 by legal counsel. here is legal provision for bail, but the Nigerian Bar Association
 and human rights groups charge that bail is underutilized. As a result, many ac-
 cused persons remain in jail while awaiting trial for petty offenses. Bail is denied
 to those charged with murder armed robbery and drug offenses.
 Nigeria's courts have established legal traditions which a number of judges have
 sought to observe and uphold despite encroachments on their legal powers by suc-
 cessive military regimes, the existence of numerous military decrees bearing judicial
 ouster clauses and establishing parallel tribunals, and perennial underfunding. All
 of these cut to the heart of the judiciary's independence. Noted jurists have decried
 the poor funding of the judiciary as a leading factor in judicial corruption, which
 continued to be an area of public criticism in 1992. Human rights groups claim that
 the Government exerts implicit pressure in certain cases.
 Judges nevertheless demonstrated independence during the detention of the five
 human rights monitors in May and June, demanding that the Government produce
 the detainees in person and guarantee visitation rights by family, legal counsel, and
 doctors. Damages were also awarded to some of the detainees when judges ruled
 that their detentions had been illegal, null, and void. Three justices of the Lagos
 Court of Appeal described as contemptuous the Government's failure to release Glo-
 ria Mowann in February in accordance with a high court ruling and refused to con-
 sider the Government's appeal of the decision until it had first comolieid with the
 
 
 200
 high court order and released the detainee (see Section 1.d.). An Ikeja high court
 ordered police and security agents to leave the premises of the Concord Press.-Lim-
 ited on April 16 after it had been shut down and surrounded by government security
 agents 8 days earlier. The Government did not, however, comply with that order,
 nor with any of the other court orders mentioned above.
 It is difficult to distingish political prisoners from political detainees being held
 without charge, for whichn there are no firm statistics. The detentions of the five
 human rights monitors in May and June were political in nature. The exact number
 of political prisoners and detainees cannot be determined. The Government claims
 no one is held under Decree Two, while the CLO maintains that 25 persons are de-
 tained under that decree.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family. Home, or Correspondence.-Nige.
 rian law stipulates that a search warrant be issued by a magistrate or senior police
 official before law enforcement agents may search private premises. Human rights
 u   report that security officers routinely ignore this requirement. Shortly after
 the May and June arrests of human rights monitors the offices of the Committee
 for the Defense of Human Rights (CDHR) and the LO in Lagos, and that of the
 CLO in Kaduna, were reportedly searched and ransacked by security agents. The
 organizations state that no warrant was presented before the search. Office equip-
 ment and files were seized during the operations and never returned. Nigerian soci-
 ety otherwise is largely free of arbitrary interference by the State in the conduct
 of their private lives. Provisions of the 1989 Constitution guarantee the rights ofpri-
 vacy in the home, in correspondence, and in oral electronic communications. The
 State does not carry out general surveillance of the population.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the 1989 Constitution provides for
 freedom of speech and the press, serious constraints remain. There are no restric-
 tions on ownership of print media; newspapers and journals remain very lively and
 often outspoken, despite considerable fear of government retribution for articles
 deemed too offensive or inflammatory. Private daily newspapers compete with the
 various state and federally owned newspapers. Officials regularly caution journalists
 publicly and privately on their responsibilities and the limits of press freedom. In
 late 1992, the Government licensed nine commercial television broadcasters, some
 of whom are expected to begin operations in early 1993. It is not known whether
 religious and political organizations will be issued broadcast licenses.
 Although there are no constitutional or other published guidelines or decrees di-
 rectly limiting freedom of speech and the press, Decree Two prohibitions against
 acts prejudicial to state security or to economic stability cast an ominous shadow
 over journalists considering which stories they may safely investigate and write.
 Among the issues considered most sensitive by the Government are: identifying top
 government officials with criminal activity and corruption; writing on subjects the
 Government claims to be incitement to riot or ethnoreligious disturbances; and
 touching on subjects the Government sees as "disrupting the transition to civilian
 rule program." These well-known sensitivities and the Government's proven willing-
 ness to take action against offending journalists and journals commonly result in
 self-censorship.
 There were various instances of  vernment censorshi in 1992. On April 9, police
 and security agents closed down the Concord Group of newspapers, the publisher
 of a daily national newspaper, a weekly national magazine, and other publications.
 Decree 14 of 1992 proscribed the publishing firm but was repealed 15 days later.
 The Government charged the newspaper with undermining the national interest
 and security and reopened it only after the chairman of the company, M.K.O.
 Abiola, publicly apologized to the President. Several senior members of the staff of
 the company refused to apologize and resigned in protest.
 The editor of the Nigerian Tribune, Folu Olamiti, and his deputy were arrested
 in March and arraigned for alleged incitement, defamation and publication of false
 news for an article entitled'"Ibadan under Police Siege.' two journalists were ar-
 rested in Kaduna on September 9 for writing articles offensive to the Government,
 and two human rights monitors were arrested in Osogbo in February for carrying
 a pamphlet critical of the Government. A printer was reportedly arrested in Novem-
 ber for printing pamphlets critical of the military Government's delay of the transi-
 tion to civilian rule.
 The Government also announced measures which will limit certain press and ar-
 tistic freedoms. The Nigerian Film Corporation in May announced its intention to
 implement new policies restricting foreigners' access to make movies in Nigeria and
 to set standards for the type and content of films which may be exported. The Min-
 istry of Information and Culture accredits foreign journalists (both permanent resi-
 
 
 dents and visiting journalists) and acts as a clearing house for all information
 meant for publication in foreign media. Those seeking licenses to operate private tel-
 evision and radio stations are required to promote the national interest, unity, and
 cohesion; they may not offend religious sensibilities or promote ethnicity, sectional-
 ism, hatred, or disaffection among the nation's many ethnic groups.
 Academic freedom is generally respected, although some groups allege that gov-
 ernment security agencies maintain an active undercover presence on the campuses,
 and that university authorities sometimes act at the behest of the Government to
 suspend or expel student activists. Furthermore, the Academic Staff of Universities
 Union (ASUU) was banned on July 22 after striking over wage and autonomy is-
 sues. Although the strike was settled in September, the Government has not lifted
 the ban on ASUU. The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) remained
 officially banned in 1992. Its president and a former officer were arrested and held
 for a short period in June after the May student protests which sparked riots in
 several cities and campuses throughout the country (see Section 1.d.). The Govern-
 ment banned or limited student union activities as a result of numerous student
 potests and campus closures during the year, and all college campuses were closed
 etween July and September during the ASUU strike. Student activists continued
 to face harassment from university and security officials, while school officials also
 sought to control the activities of violent criminal gangs popularly known as "secret
 cults." "Anticult" boards and other disciplinary bodies continued to function in 1992,
 though civil courts overturned some of their expulsion decisions upon appeal. The
 universities generally complied with reinstatement orders. Human rights groups
 had complained that innocent students were sometimes denounced by informants
 out to settle a grudge.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Nigeria's 1989 Constitution
 provides all citizens the right to assemble freely and to associate with other persons
 in political parties, trade unions, or other special interest associations. Permits are
 not normally required for public meetings indoors, and permit rectuirements for out-
 doorpublic functions are often ignored. However, on the authority of Decree Five
 the Government has banned gatherings whose political, ethnic, or religious over-
 tones it feared might lead to unrest. Decree Five was used to prohibit the CLO's
 November 27 "Vigil for Democracy." The CLO ignored the ban, however, and the
 vigil was broken up by police and security service agents. Open air religious services
 away from places of worship remain prohibited in most states due to religious ten-
 sions in various parts of the country.
 Nigerians form and participate in a wide variety of special interest organizations,
 including religious groups, trade groups, women's orgnzations, and professional as-
 sociations. Organizations need not register with the Government and are generally
 permitted free association with other national and foreign bodies..Relgious groups
 must nevertheless be sanctioned by either the Christian Associatin of Nigeria or
 the Supreme Council for Islamic Affar.The Government still permits only two po-
 litical parties, which it organized and founded in 1989. In May the Government
 banned several political organizations which it contends were founded primarily
 along ethnic, tribal, religious, or other parochial lines for the purpose of sponsoring
 various political candidates. In May olice and security agents in Jlos unsuccessfully
 attempted to prevent a summit meeting of CD members, and in June sought to pre-
 vent a meeting of the Nigerian Bar Association, which was considering responses
 to the Government's arrest of two prominent human rights law ters.
 After 5 human rights monitors were released from detention in June, security
 agents at tempted to prevent them from holding a press conference in offices belong-
 ing to the Nigerian Union of Journalists. In July police used tear gas to disperse
 a gathering of former residents of a shantytown known as Morko, which was de-
 stroyed by the Lags State Government in 1990. In the same month, securiy per-
 sonnel arrested the organizers of the National Seminar for Women Politicians. Fol-
 lowing postponement of the transition to civilian rule, the police prevented the CLO
 from convening a conference on taxation and women's legal rights in Lagos and also
 banned the convening of a conference in Bein City on Human Rights and the Third
 Republic.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The 1989 Constitution prohibits federal and state govern-
 ments from adopting an official state relig ion. Constitutional provisions guarantee-
 ing freedom of belief, practice' and education in regard to religon are generally.re-
 spected. Ethnoreligious violence, particularly in northern Nigeria, often icludesthe
 razing of churches and mosques by rival factions, as occurred during the bloody Feb-
 ruary and May disturbances in Kaduna State.
 Distribution of religious publications is generally unrestricted, but these are sub-
 ject to the same censorship considerations as the regular press. There were allega-
 tions in 1992, by both Christian and Muslim organizations, that the Ministry of For-
 
 
 202
 eign Affairs and the Immigration Department were restricting the entry into the
 country of certain religious practitioners, particularly persons suspected of pros-
 elytizing. Religious practitioners operating schools, institutions, or medical facilities
 generally were not affected, nor were those seeking a renewal of existing residence
 permits.
 In February and May there were outbreaks of violence between largely Christian
 and Muslim ethnic groups in Kaduna State, originally around the town of Zangon-
 Kataf, and later spreading to Kaduna and other cities. Casualty estimates range
 from several hundred to a few thousand. Dozens of churches and mosques were de-
 stroyed before security forces could reimpose order.
 The Government instituted a ban in 1987 (which is still in effect) on religious or-
 ganizations on campuses of schools above the primary level, though individual stu-
 ents retain the right to practice their religion in recognized places of worship.
 There is a lightly enforced ban on published religious advertisements, and religious
 programming on television and. radio remains closely controlled by the Government.
 The ban on the Maitatsine Muslim *sect" has not been repealed, but there were no
 efforts during 1992 to enforce it.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Nigeria's Constitution entitles its citizens to move freely throughout the
 country and to reside where they wish. The Constitution also prohibits expulsion or
 the denial of exit or entry to any Nigerian citizen. Nigerians travel abroad in large
 numbers, and thousands are engaged overseas in work and study. Exit visas are not
 required. The Government occasionally prevents travel for political reasons. It
 seized the passports of two prominent members of the CLO in January and April.
 In March the Government released the passport seized in January, along with the
 passports of three other human rights monitors seized at various times since 1990.
 The Government retains custody of the passport seized in April, and legal proceed-
 ings are underway to secure its release.
 Under Nigerian law, wives--including foreigners-must have their husband's per-
 mission to take their children out of Nigeria. Security officials in the past have pre-
 vented some wives from leaving with children, but there were no known instances
 of such interference in 1992. Citizens leaving Nigeria have the right to reenter, and
 citizenship may not be revoked for any reason.
 Nigerian law and practice permit temporary refuge and asylum in Nigeria for po-
 litical refugees from other countries. Nigeria supports and cooperates with the Lagos
 office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). A Liberian
 refugee camp continued to operate in Ogun State. Its population varied between 700
 and 1,500 persons, depending on the level of conflict in Liberia. There is also an
 undetermined number of Chadian refugees residing primarily in the northern bor-
 der region. Human rights groups in Chad and Nigeria have alleged that up to 300
 Chadian refugees were arrested by Borno State poie authorities in March and forc-
 ibly repatriated to Chad, where they were allegedly executed by forces of the Gov-
 ernment of Chad. The National Commission for Refugees investigated these allega-
 tions in May and reported they could find no substantiation. The UNHCR in Lagos
 reported that no Chadian refugees registered with it had been forcibly repatriated.
 Many of the Chadian refugees who fled into northern Nigeria during the heavy
 fighting in the Lake Chad region in January, however, were not registered with the
 UNHCR, and no refugee camps were established for them. Some of the Chadians
 residing in northern Nigeria were alleged by the Chadian Government to be mem-
 bers of rebellious armed factions.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens did not have this right at the national level during 1992. In 1992 the
 19-member AFRC headed by President Babangida was the highest political author-
 ity in the land. Until late 1992, the Government continued its closely controlled pro-
 gram of political transition to civilian government. Elected civilians were inaugu-
 rated as state governors, mehibers of state houses of assembly and members of the
 national legislature. The Government conducted elections for the Senate and House
 of Representatives, and oversaw presidential primaries by the two official political
 parties. After dictating the creation of the only two legal parties, the Government
 provided their constitutions, manifestos, platforms and the majority of their financ-
 ing, and gave them the exclusive right to contest for public office. The two parties
 are the National Republic Convention (NRC), which is "slightly to the right," and
 the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which is "slightly to the left." The two parties
 conducted primaries in June for the national legislative elections held on July 4.
 The National Electoral Commission (NEC) a governmental body, in late June
 disqualifed 19 House and Senate SDP candidates and 13 NRC candidates from con-
 
 
 203
 testing the July 4 elections. While the candidates were reportedly banned for secu-
 rity reasons or for offenses committed during previous government service, no offil
 cial explanation was provided to the public, and the banned candidates had no re-
 course for appeal.
 The Government initially planned for the two parties to bold their presidential
 primaries in six rounds of five states each, on six successive Saturdays in August
 and September. The first round, conducted August 1, was marred by widespread
 fraud and electoral malpractices and, at the behest of both parties, the NEC an-
 nulled the announced results and rescheduled the primaries for 3 rounds of 10
 states each, to be held on successive Saturdays in September. The primaries were
 again marred by widespread allegations of voter accreditation fraud, vote buying,
 and fraudulent election returns. Numerous candidates called for the cancelation of
 results in various states, and 10 of the 12 SDP presidential aspirants conducted a
 boycott of the third and final round of primaries on September 26.
 On October 16, President Babangida announced that the AFRC had canceled the
 remaining round of presidential primaries, dissolved the executive committees of
 both parties at the national, state, and local level, named caretaker committees to
 run the parties, and said that the NEC would propose to the AFRC a new selection
 process for presidential candidates. On November 17, President Babangida an-
 nounced the banning of all 23 presidential aspirants who participated in the an-
 nulled September primaries and laid out a new schedule for completing the transi-
 tion to civilian rule by August 27, 1993. The presidential election is now scheduled
 for June 12, 1993. The President also announced that the open ballot, which effec-
 tively disenfranchised those persons not willing to be seen openly supporting a can-
 didate or party, would be replaced by the open-secret ballot (see Introduction).
 AFRC Decree 53 of December 2, 1992, precludes the National Assembly from leis-
 lating in any significant area of national life until the inauguration of a civilian
 president.
 Nigerian politics continue to be male-dominated. However, there are no legal im-
 pediments to political participation or voting by women, and the Government ac-
 tively encouraged their involvement. Several women contested national office in
 1992, though only 1 woman won a seat in the 91-member Senate, and 6 women ob-
 tained places in the 589-member House of Representatives.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights groups across a broad spectrum are engaged in the vocal and public
 camp aign for the promotion of human rights in Nigeria, and their number increases
 year y. Among the most active Nigerian human rights organizations are: the Civil
 Liberties Organization (CLO); the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights
 (CDHR); the Constitutional Rights Project (CRP); the National Association of Demo-
 cratic Lawyers (NADL); Human Rights Africa (HRA); the Legal Research and Re-
 source Development Centre (LRRDC); the National Association of University
 Women (NAUW); the International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA); and the
 Human Rights Committees of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) and its state and
 local chapters. A number of prominent authors, artists, educators, and jurists, in ad-
 dition to professional and labor organizations, have spoken out frequently on human
 rights issues as well.
 There were several incidents of government interference and harassment of
 human rights monitors throughout the year. These increased following the post-
 ponement of national elections. For instance the police and security agents dis-
 banded a prodemocracy vigil and prevented other events from taking place (see Sec-
 tion 2.b.), raided CLO offices in Kaduna, arrested CLO members, searched the home
 of Dr. Beko Ransome-Kuti, and confiscated prodemocracy literature. High-level gov-
 ernment officials denounced the activities of some members of the human rights
 community during the year as being politically motivated, dishonest, destabilizing,
 and treasonous. In a December 28 statement, the Inspector General of Police an-
 nounced that "security agencies (were) monitoring the activities of the human rights
 activists." On January 1, 1993, President Babangida warned that the Government
 would deal forcefully with individuals and organizations seen to be destabilizing Ni-
 geria. The same day, Dr. Ransome-Kuti was taken into custody; he was released on
 January 4. Both events seem to have been linked to opposition calls for mass pro-
 tests on January 2, the date the transition to civilian government was originally to
 have taken place.
 Foreign human rights groups are permitted to visit Nigeria. The Government has
 upon occasion responded to domestic human rights groups' charges.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 There is no official policy of discrimination against any of Nigeria's 250 ethnic
 groups, and laws do not favor one group over another. The 1989 Constitution re-
 quires that government employment and the provision of government services re.
 flect "federal character," i.e., apportioning public employment and government serv-
 ices to reflect the ethnic and regional distribution of the population. The Govern-
 ment generally makes a conscious effort to strike a balance among different groups
 in its decisionmaking and in appointments to key government positions. Ethnic and
 regional hiring quotas are observed in most public sector employment. However Ni-
 geria has a long history of tension among its diverse ethnic groups. Bloodshed be-
 tween rival ethnic groups in Kaduna, Benue, Taraba Enugu and Akwa-Ibm States
 in 1992 were responsible for thousands of deaths and tens of thousands of displaced
 persons. Tradition continues to impose considerable pressure on individual govern-
 ment officials to favor their own ethnic or religious group, and religious and ethnic
 favoritism or harassment persists. Persons not indigenous to their state of residence
 frequently experience difficulty, e.g., in finding employment and enrolling their chil-
 dren in the schools of their choice.
 Women have always had some economic power and have exerted influence in Ni-
 gerian society through women's councils, family connections, and to a much lesser
 extent, mainstream social, economic, or political organizations. As primary school
 enrollment increases, girls and young women are gaining greater access to edu-
 cation. However, females receive less than a third of the education that males re-
 ceive, according to U.N. estimates.
 There has been a dramatic increase in the number of women obtaining university
 degrees and becoming professionals, including teachers, lawyers, doctors, judges,
 senior government officials, media figures, and business executives. Women never-
 theless suffer discrimination in employment as well as social prejudice. The pattern
 of discrimination against women varies according to the ethnic and religious diver-
 sity of Nigeria's large and heterogeneous population. As noted in Section 2.d., in
 some states, husbands can prevent their wives from obtaining employment or pass-
 ports. In many states a woman cannot own property in her own right and, as a
 widow, cannot inherit her husband's prerty, which in the absence of children, usu-
 ally reverts to the husband's family. Women do not receive equal pay for equal work
 in many instances, and male professionals receive fringe benefits not extended to
 their female counterparts.
 Women often rind it extremely difficult to acquire commercial credit or obtain tax
 deductions or rebates as the heads of households. Single mothers face added dis-
 crimination. The sale of young girls for marriage is still fairly common. While vio-
 lence against women exists, there are no statistical data to help determine the ex-
 tent of the problem. Police do not normally intervene in domestic disputes. Wife
 beating is common, particularly in rural areas where women are poorly educated
 and ignorant of the law. In the more traditional areas, it is questionable whether
 the courts and police actively intervene to protect women who formally accuse their
 husbands if the level of alleged abuse does not exceed customary norms.
 The Government publicly opposes female genital mutilation (circumcision). Ac-
 cording to an independent expert in the field, the percentage of Nigerian women
 who have undergone this procedure may be as high as 50 percent. The most dan-
 gerous form, infibulation, is still practiced in some areas. Nongovernmental organi-
 zations and the Federal Ministry of Health sponsored public awareness and edu-
 cation projects to inform communities of the health hazards associated with female
 genital mutilation, but the practice has not been criminalized.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Nigerian workers, except members of the armed
 forces and employees designated essential by the Government, may join trade
 unions. While firefighters and police were always considered essential services, since
 1990 employees of the central bank, the security printers, and the customs and ex-
 cise staff have been added tW that category and their union dissolved. Utilities, the
 national airline, public sector enterprises, and the post office, however, are not con-
 sidered essential services and are unionized. The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC),
 Nigeria's umbrella labor federation, has repeatedly called on the Government to re-
 instate unions in all sectors of the economy except for the armed forces, firefighters,
 and police. Although the Government promised to examine this issue, it did not do
 so until late in the transition, leaving the issue for the incoming civilian govern-
 ment.
 Under Nigerian labor law any nonagricultural enterprise which employs more
 than 50 employees is obliged to recognize trade unions and must pay or deduct a
 dues checkoff for the employees who are members. The Government works closely
 
 
 205
 with the NLC to enforce this provision. Most of the agricultural sector, the informal
 sector, and practically all small industries and businesses remain nonunionized,
 however. The NLC has complained that some employers deliberately break up their
 industries into multiple units employing less than 50 workers to avoid unionization.
 The right to strike is recognized by law, except in the case of essential services
 as defined by the Government. During 1992 strikes were relatively few and of short
 duration and focused primarily on pay and benefits. The Labor Ministry, as a mat-
 ter of policy, effectively exerts pressure to prevent or force settlement of most dis-
 putes.
 The NWC claims 3 million members out of a total work force of 30 million, but
 this figure is difficult to verify. Although the available work force has increased as
 the population has grown, trade union membership has probably declined somewhat
 due to low economic growth. With unemployment at high levels, many workers re-
 main more interested in securing employment than in labor union activity.
 While the trade union movement has had, within limits, considerable latitude for
 action, it remains subject to government oversight. Despite p revisions in the 1989
 Constitution and Nigeria's ratification of 29 International Labor Organization (ILO)
 conventions, government decrees and policy continue to restrict labor freedoms. A
 1978 decree established the NLC as a single central labor body, created 42 (now 41)
 industrial unions through forced mergers, and deregistered all other unions.
 In recent years the Government and the NLC have agreed that further consolida-
 tion of the labor movement would increase its effectiveness. The Government pre-
 sented a plan that would merge the present 41 unions into 19, while the NLC as
 its own merger plan, which would reportedly result in 21 unions. Both the Govern-
 ment and the NLC have become deeply involved with the transition and economic
 restructuring, however, and the merger schemes have been set aside until the tran-
 sition is complete and a new government is in place.
 The ILO continues to criticize the Nigerian Labor Code, which it asserts is not
 fully in compliance with ILO conventions. Held up for criticism is the single trade
 union system, the ban on organizing for certain categories of workers, the bread
 powers of the Government to supervise union accounts at any time, and restrictions
 on the right to strike through compulsory arbitration.
 In August 1991, Decree 35 amended a policy in force since 1975 which permitted
 international labor affiliation only with the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity and affiliated pan-African labor federations. The old policy provided for crimi-
 nal fines and imprisonment of individuals and prescription'of unions for violating
 the ban. Decree 35 of 1991 partially repealed the ban by allowing affiliation with
 non-African international labor organizations, but only for training and educational
 assistance. In 1992 the ILO praised Nigeria for issuing Decree 35.
 NLC president Paschal Bafyau has publicly endorsed the Social Democratic Party
 (SDP). Although the Government warned Bafyau that under the transition to civil
 rule program it is illegal for organized bodies, such as the NLC, to engage in par-
 tisan   itics, neither Bafyau nor the NW have been sanctioned.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Co l ectivel y.-The labor laws of Nigeria per-
 mit both the right to organize and the right to bargain collectively between manage-
 ment and trade unions. Collective bargaining is, in fact, common in many sectors
 of the economy.
 Nigerian law further protects workers against retaliation by employers for labor
 activity through an independent arm of the judiciary, the Nigerian Industrial Court,
 which handles complaints of antiunion discrimination.
 The Government, however, retains bread authority over labor matters. In many
 areas of contention, the unions often take their demands directly to the Government
 rather than to the employers. At the same time, the Government can intervene
 forcefully to end debate on issues which it feels contravene its essential political or
 economic programs.
 In January 1991, the Government abolished the uniform wage structure for all
 government entities. Now each tier of government-federal, state, local, and state-
 owned firms-is free to negotiate its own level of wages, benefits and conditions of
 employment. As a result, negotiations previously conducted on a nationwide basis
 under the direct supervision of the Labor Ministry are now conducted on a local,
 often plantwide, basis with less government involvement. The Labor Ministry has
 tried to restrict its role to enforcement of minimum wage and freedom of association
 laws.
 President Babangida laid the cornerstone for an export processing zone on Novem-
 ber 8, 1991, but there has been little action since, and a date for commencement
 of operations has not been announced. The Government has thus yet to address the
 shape of labor law and regulations within the zone.
 
 
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Nigeria's 1989 Constitution pro-
 hibits forced or compulsory labor, and no violations were reported in 1992.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Nigeria's 1974 Labor Decree pro-
 hibits employment of children under 15 years of age in commerce and industry and
 restricts other child labor to home-based agricultural or domestic work. The Labor
 Decree does allow the apprenticeship of youths aged 13 to 15, but only under spe-
 cific conditions. Apprenticeship exists in a wide range of crafts, trades, and state
 enterprises. With respect to apprentices over the age of 15, their activit is not spe-
 cifically regulated by the Government. According to the NLC, child laor is not a
 serious problem in Nigeria and is largely confined to the informal sector, where it
 is often difficult to enforce the law. However, casual observation reveals many chil-
 dren employed in the informal sector in urban areas.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Nigeria's 1974 Labor Decree also establishes
 a 40-hour workweek, prescribes 2 to 4 weeks of annual leave, and sets a minimum
 wage for commerce and industry. While this wage may be adequate for some, it is
 insufficient to support a family in major urban areas. The wages of many workers
 have not kept pace with inflation, and this has led to calls for large wage increases
 and increasingly frequent strikes. The 1974 Decree also contains general health and
 safety rovisions, some aimed specifically at youth and female workers, and all en-
 forceable by the Ministry of Labor.
 Employers must compensate injured workers and dependent survivors of those
 killed in industrial accidents. The ineffectiveness of the Ministry in enforcing these
 laws in the workplace is regularly criticized by labor unions.
 In 1991 Nigeria invited an IL0 tripartite team to evaluate the country's labor in-
 spection system. The team determined that Nigeria is not yet fully in compliance
 with the relevant ILO conventions, as it does not maintain adequate statistics on
 its inspection program.
