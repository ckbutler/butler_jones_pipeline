 BRUNEI
 Brunei is a small, wealthy, Islamic monarchy located on the
 north coast of Borneo. Although there are substantial Chinese
 and other minorities, it is predominantly Malay in
 population. Brunei is a hereditary and traditional Sultanate
 that has been ruled by the same family for over 500 years. A
 British-protected state until January 1, 1984, Brunei has been
 internally self-governing since 1959.
 A Constitution promulgated in 1959 provided for the first
 sharing of political power by the Sultan, who since
 independence has been advised by a Council of Ministers.
 The Constitution, however, permits the Sultan to override the
 decisions of legislative and executive bodies in most
 instances.. In elections for a legislative council in 1962, a
 party opposed to policies of the Sultan won a large majority;
 tensions over policy differences led to an armed uprising in
 December 1962 that was quickly put down by British troops.
 The Sultanthen invoked an article of the Constitution
 allowing him to assume emergency powers for 2 years. This
 state of emergency has been'renewed every 2 years and is still
 in force. Although the Constitution is not suspended, the
 state of emergency allows the Sultan great latitude in ruling
 by orders. These orders have in effect suspended certain
 articles of the Constitution.
 Since 1962 there have been no disturbances or agitation in
 Brunei. Economic factors have much to do with the prevailing
 general sense of well-being. Relative to its small population
 of about 220,000 people, Brunei produces substantial amounts
 of petroleum, roughly 160,000 barrels of crude oil per day
 plus slightly over 5 million tons of liquified natural gas
 (LNG) per year. It has one of the highest per capita gross
 domestic products in the world. The oil and LNG revenues
 enable the Government to provide free medical care, schools,
 and free university training. A large proportion of the Malay
 population is employed by the Government at generous salaries
 which permit a higher standard of living than in surrounding
 countries. Government employees are also eligible for
 low-interest or no-interest loans to purchase homes,
 automobiles, and appliances. The nation's other large
 employer, Brunei Shell Petroleum, provides comparable
 benefits. Brunei has no income tax.
 The human rights situation in Brunei in 1986 remained
 essentially unchanged.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known instances of politically motivated
 killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances nor was there evidence of
 persons having been abducted, secretly arrested, or
 clandestinely detained.

 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no known instances of people having been subjected
 to torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment. Prison conditions are good.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There were no allegations or known instances of people
 detained, punished, or tried for the expression of views
 critical of or different from those of the Government in 1986
 or any recent year. Six detainees from the insurrection of
 1962 and from the mid-1970's were released during the year,
 but it is estimated that as many as five may still be held.
 Several leaders of the 1962 insurrection live abroad. They
 have not been sentenced to exile, a punishment that is not
 practiced in Brunei, but may still fear that they would be
 imprisoned if they should return home. Detention conditions
 for detainees are modern and comfortable.
 Brunei does not permit forced or compulsory labor and there
 have been no reports of this practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The legal system in Brunei is in most respects derived from
 the British system. Those suspected of common crimes are
 detained, tried, and punished according to the law. Lacking a
 senior judiciary of its own, the Brunei High Court has for its
 Chief Justice a British judge seconded from Hong Kong. There
 were no known instances of interference with the judiciary by
 the Government in 1986 or in any other recent year.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Although the Government may intrude into the privacy of
 individual persons, families, or homes, in practice it does
 not do so.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including;
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although a political party was organized in 1985 with
 government approval, there have been no challenges which would
 have tested the Government's degree of tolerance in the
 political arena.
 Brunei's only television station is government owned (two
 Malaysian stations can also be received). It consistently
 avoids controversial issues, as do the newscasts on local
 radio stations. The single weekly newspaper also usually
 avoids controversial issues. It may occasionally address
 issues embarrassing to the Government, but sometimes
 attributes such coverage to the foreign news media.
 Distribution of a weekly overseas magazine that once published
 articles considered critical of the Government has resumed.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government permits the formation of associations for many
 kinds of private economic, recreational, or other purposes

 without interference, but it requires their registration.
 There are no reports that registration has been denied by the
 Government. In May 1985, the Government allowed establishment
 of the Brunei National Democratic Party (BNDP), the first
 political party since party activity ended in 1967. Just
 before its first public meeting, the Government announced that
 government employees could not attend party meetings, become
 members of political parties, or otherwise engage in organized
 political debate. Few members of the public were attracted to
 the party's launching assembly (the local press reported fewer
 than 100 people attended) and the longer term prospects of the
 party are unclear. There have been no other known instances
 of government interference with party membership drives.
 Party officials, in conversations with the foreign press, have
 outlined clearly their objectives.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official state religion, but the Constitution
 guarantees freedom of worship for other religions and this
 right is freely exercised.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement in the
 country or abroad for its citizens. Brunei has not been
 willing to accept refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Under the continuing state of emergency there are no
 representative bodies at the national or local level.
 Citizens can effect changes in government only by working
 through appointed village headmen and district officers, who
 meet regularly with their constituents.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no chapters of Amnesty International or other
 organizations concerned with human rights in Brunei.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The status of women in Brunei is similiar to that in
 surrounding countries. Women are not under legal pressure to
 observe strict Muslim standards of dress, although most Muslim
 women do observe these standards. Non-Muslim women generally
 dress conservatively. Women are widely employed in the
 Government, primarily in clerical and secretarial positions.
 A few hold professional senior level positions.
 The great majority of the substantial Chinese minority in
 Brunei are not citizens (those having no claims to other
 nationalities were "British-protected persons" prior to
 independence and are now either stateless permanent or
 temporary residents). Many of the Chinese are temporary
 residents from other countries and some of these have been in
 Brunei for many years. In general, the Chinese community has
 prospered in Brunei and much of the country's commercial
 activity is in Chinese hands.

 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Working conditions are subject to inspection by the Labor
 Commission on several types of occasions: routinely, annually,
 at the time of immigrant worker quota renewal, and in response
 to complaints. These inspections concern adherence to minimum
 safety and health standards and compliance with compensation
 plans as filed with the Labor Commission. Brunei does not
 have a minimum wage law, but the Labor Department determines a
 "prevailing wage" for each worker category. Employers are
 required to pay at least the prevailing wage to obtain
 approval for a worker quota. In practice, given the shortage
 of labor, market forces allow most citizens of Brunei to
 command wages above prevailing wage rates. Employment of
 children below the age of 16 is prohibited, and below the age
 of 18 requires the written consent of the child's parent or
 guardian and approval of the Labor Commission. However, older
 children often help out with a family enterprise when school
 is not in session. Another restriction is that women under 18
 may not work at night or on offshore oil platforms. Work in
 excess of 48 hours requires payment of overtime. Double time
 must be paid for work performed on legal holidays.
