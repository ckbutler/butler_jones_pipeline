 BULGARIA
 The ouster of long-term leader Todor Zhivkov at the end of
 1989 brought profound political change to Bulgaria. Within a
 few months the ruling Bulgarian Communist party had renounced
 one-party rule, formally repudiated the forced assimilation
 campaign against the ethnic Turkish and Pomak (Bulgarian
 Muslim) minorities, and permitted the formation of rival
 political organizations. Changing its name to the Bulgarian
 Socialist Party (BSP), the ruling party agreed to roundtable
 talks with political opposition forces which established the
 basis for political and economic reforms. The BSP won
 parliamentary elections in June 1990 with a small majority of
 seats. The Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), a coalition of
 opposition political groups, won over one-third of the seats,
 and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF), which
 represents the Muslim population, won the third largest
 block. International observers pronounced the elections free,
 but many agreed with opposition claims that intimidation by
 Socialists was a factor in their victory. After the
 elections, Prime Minister Andrey Lukanov formed an all-BSP
 government. In August UDF Chairman Zhelyu Zhele i was elected
 President to succeed Petur Mladenov, who had taken over from
 Zhivkov.
 The Ministry of the Interior supervises the militia (police),
 state security forces, internal security troops, border
 guards, and special purpose forces. Early parliamentary
 reforms addressed conversion of the Ministry of the Interior
 into a legitimate police and security service, removing the
 intelligence service from the control of the Ministry and
 placing it under the President. Militia forces were
 drastically reduced. The Government said it had abolished the
 Ministry's notorious sixth department, responsible for
 monitoring the political and social activities of Bulgarian
 citizens. There are allegations, however, that correspondence
 and telephone conversations of opposition activists continue
 to be monitored. Police units have committed no known abuses,
 but they and other Ministry units failed to react in time when
 demonstrators in August got out of control and burned BSP
 headquarters in Sofia.
 The deepening economic crisis delayed some attempts at overall
 reform. Mid-1990 economic statistics publicly confirmed a
 large foreign debt, decreased productivity, decreased capital
 investment, unfulfilled contracts with trading partners,
 increased outlays for social security and salaries, high
 unemployment, and inflation. Persian Gulf events magnified
 Bulgaria's economic problems, as did the prospect of
 conducting Bulgarian-Soviet bilateral trade in hard currency
 terms in 1991.
 There was significant progress in human rights, particularly
 with respect to freedom of speech, press, assembly,
 association, religion, and travel. Progress was more marked
 in urban areas; in the provinces, there continued to be some
 obstruction to freedom of speech, press, and assembly, among
 others. Much progress was made in reversing the previous
 policy of forcibly assimilating ethnic Turks and Bulgarian
 Muslims, but they continued to experience some societal
 discrimination.

 BULGARI
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of such killings in 1990.
 b. Disappearance
 No instances of disappearance were known to have occurred.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading-
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were no reports of torture or other cruel treatment.
 Several human rights organizations, which were allowed access
 to Bulgarian prisons in 1990, reported that conditions were
 stark and difficult but did not threaten life or general
 health. The Government in 1990 took steps to eliminate some
 of the more severe aspects of prison life. Hard labor
 reportedly no longer exists as a form of punishment. In the
 wake of revelations of "death camps" at Belene and elsewhere,
 the Government closed its most notorious facility, the Belene
 Island prison, and either amnestied or transferred the
 prisoners. Until early 1990, there had-been credible reports
 of improper sanitary facilities, no heat, and grueling work
 and punishment routines for prisoners there. The President
 exercised his considerable constitutional authority to pardon
 dozens of prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Early in 1990, the Government and the legislature (Grand
 National Assembly or GNA) began the process of bringing the
 penal code into line with accepted international norms. The
 new constitution and penal code are expected to be completed
 by the GNA in 1991. New procedures for detention and access
 to an attorney were implemented, but there is as yet no
 judicial review of detention. Bail does exist. Cases of
 arbitrary arrest and detention have decreased or possibly
 disappeared altogether. Summary exile, house arrest, internal
 exile, and incommunicado detention.no longer exist as lawful
 forms of punishment and were not imposed. Ousted Bulgarian
 Communist Party leader Todor Zhivkov and two of his
 associates, however, have been held under house arrest (in
 lieu of being imprisoned) for 1'0 months pending trial. They
 have had access to counsel during this period.
 Podkrepa trade union Chief Dr. Konstantin Trenchev was briefly
 placed under "city arrest" after being charged with incitement
 in connection with the fire that partially destroyed BSP
 headquarters in August. The "city arrest" provisions
 restricted Trenchev's international travel while his case was
 under investigation; however, the President intervened and
 persuaded the authorities to waive the restriction and permit
 Trenchev to travel. Opposition groups allege the fire may
 have been set by the BSP and that charges were brought in
 order to intimidate Trenchev. The investigation of the blaze
 has been inconclusive thus far.
 
 
 1102
 BULGARIA
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Bulgarian law and general practice provide for public trial in
 criminal cases. Persons suspected of criminal offenses are now
 entitled to counsel as soon as a formal investigation begins.
 Closed trials may be held in cases involving state security or
 to preserve state secrets. Separate military courts and a
 special military section of the Supreme Court exist for cases
 involving military personnel and Interior Ministry personnel.
 There has been no major reform of these judicial bodies.
 A number of blatantly unfair judicial decisions, some
 involving criminal trials, were reversed in 1990. The Supreme
 Court thereby put lower courts on notice that judicial
 decisions could not be crafted in a way that ignored or
 distorted the relevant laws. Most political prisoners were
 amnestied, but their convictions or arrest records remained in
 court registers. Podkrepa Chairman Trenchev, Chairman Nikolay
 Kolev of the Independent Society for the Defense of Human
 Rights, and several other activists sued to have the records
 of their cases expunged, but they are still awaiting a
 response from the court.
 The Independent Society, as well as international bodies, such
 as Amnesty International (AI), maintain lists of political
 prisoners in Bulgaria. Although the Government claims to have
 amnestied all prisoners held on purely political grounds early
 in 1990, the Independent Society, as well as AI, claim that
 some people remain in Bulgarian prisons for political acts.
 In most of these cases, which reportedly number less than 50,
 they allege that the prisoners are held on false charges, such
 as commission of terrorist acts and common criminal offenses,
 only as a means of punishing them for their political acts and
 beliefs.
 Among those alleged to have been wrongfully convicted and
 still being held are ethnic Turks and Muslims convicted of
 penal offenses such as weapons charges or terrorism. There
 were no reports of such sentences in 1990.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Sanctity of the home is nominally safeguarded by law, and
 police may not legally search property without prior
 permission from a court or prosecutor. Several political
 activists reported in early 1990 that their homes were still
 being entered illegally and that the Government monitors
 private correspondence and telephone conversations, as was
 common before 1990. Citizens report that now, unlike in the
 past, they can generally receive correspondence from Turkey
 provided that the letters are not addressed in the Turkish
 language or alphabet.
 Membership in the Fatherland Front, now Fatherland Union, a
 mass organization controlled by the former Bulgarian Communist
 Party, is no longer mandatory, and compulsory Marxism-Leninism
 courses in schools and universities have been either abolished
 or made elective.
 As the right to privacy is gradually implemented, the number
 of government informers has reportedly been greatly reduced.
 The authorities no longer interfere with religious
 instruction. President Zhelev abolished the strict residency
 
 
 1103
 BULGARIA
 decrees which gave the Ministry of the Interior the power to
 determine who was permitted to live in Sofia and other major
 cities. Forced resettlement and internal exile have been
 abolished as forms of punishment*
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 One of the most significant human rights achievements in 1990
 was the lifting of most restrictions on freedom of speech and
 press. Persons were generally free to speak out on political
 and other issues and to criticize the Government and its
 officials openly without official reprisal.
 A genuine opposition press developed in 1990. Among the many
 political parties and movements that obtained permission to
 publish newspapers were the Union of Democratic Forces, the
 Radical Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party, the
 Green Party, Ecoglasnost, and other groups. All were able to
 operate without government interference or censorship and
 without improper pressure. The Chief Mufti in Bulgaria was
 also permitted to publish the first and so far only issue of a
 bimonthly newspaper, partly in Turkish. However, the MRF was
 unable to publish a periodical because the Government had not
 yet allocated any newsprint to it.
 The newsprint issue was a major cause for debate and protest.
 Many political organizations received both permission to
 publish and allocations of newsprint. Because of the
 Govenment's control over newsprint, it exercised de facto
 control of the press. It claimed that it could not procure
 sufficient supplies from the Soviet Union without hard
 currency, but circulation of BSP-controlled papers was not
 significantly decreased in the face of growing demand from new
 publications. Independent purchasers can acquire newsprint
 privately if they have hard currency.
 Bulgarian Radio and Television, which had initiated steps
 toward independence in late 1989, were placed under the
 supervision of the GNA in 1990 and, for the first time,
 provided a generally impartial and balanced account of news
 events. Although still a state monopoly, television and radio
 allocated regularly scheduled air time to three political
 parties during the election campaign. Throughout the year,
 supporters of both the BSP and the political opposition
 protested that the television's management was biased in favor
 of their opponents. The chairman of Bulgarian television was
 forced to resign as a result of opposition protests and
 student strikes. Radio and Television workers supported the
 November general strike which brought down the Socialist
 government.
 No fully independent book publisher yet exists. The Kyril and
 Methodius Foundation and other presses have taken some steps
 toward publication of new Western books and previously
 forbidden works. Academic presses are gradually becoming more
 autonomous. Similarly, academic freedom is increasing. The
 faculties of Bulgarian universities, however, are still
 largely politicized although many faculty members supported
 the strikes which brought down the Government.
 
 
 1104
 BULGARIA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association flourished in 1990. While
 some fear, intimidation, and inhibition still reportedly exist
 in provincial areas, numerous marches, mass meetings, and
 demonstrations occurred throughout the year in both large and
 small cities. Many took place during the June election
 campaign. Despite widespread reports that local government
 officials discriminated against opposition groups in granting
 permission for rallies as well as the use of public halls,
 these groups held many public rallies without complying with
 the new law on assembly and without interference from the
 authorities.
 A new law on associations provided for legal registration of
 independeDt groups as juridical bodies. Hundreds of political
 and social organizations took advantage of the new law and
 registered in the courts. Many of them, such as the
 Independent Society for the Defense of Human Rights, the
 independent trade union Podkrepa, and various political
 parties, were quick to establish contacts and affiliation with
 international and foreign counterparts without government
 interference.  Some groups, however, found the road to
 official acceptance difficult, if not impossible. In the case
 of the MRF, registration was delayed for several critical
 weeks before the June election as court and government
 officials debated whether to allow an organization representing
 an ethnic and religious minority to be registered. The
 Constitution and the new law on associations, as approved in
 roundtable talks with the UDF and the Bulgarian National
 Agrarian Union, forbids registration of groups with a religious
 or ethnic profile. Although the overwhelming majority of
 members in the MRF are Muslims, both ethnically Bulgarian and
 Turkish, its charter carefully avoids religious and ethnic
 definition. Ultimately, the organization was registered and
 allowed to put up candidates for GNA seats. Its application of
 its deputies to operate as a parliamentary group was debated
 intensely in the relevant parliamentary commission and
 ultimately accepted.
 The Ilinden Association, a Macedonian rights group, was
 unsuccessful in its application for registration. The courts
 deemed it to be an ethnic group with separatist objectives
 which is prohibited under the Constitution. The association
 has lost its appeal of the trial court's decision.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Bulgaria's Constitution and laws provide for freedom of
 religion, but under the totalitarian system this freedom was a
 sham. The Communist (later Socialist) government made
 substantial efforts before the elections to remove many old
 barriers to religious worship. The Patriarch of the Bulgarian
 Orthodox Church and the Chief Mufti addressed the nation on
 radio and television on religious holy days, and Orthodox
 services were broadcast on Easter. The Mufti even spoke in
 Arabic in his opening remarks at the time of Ramadan and the
 hajj. Also for the first time, Easter services at Sofia's
 Nevski Cathedral were opened to the general public. A school
 for imams and an institute for the higher study of the Islamic
 religion opened in the autumn.
 As leader of the Committee for Religious Rights, a constituent
 group in the UDF, Father Kristofer Subev, a former political
 prisoner active in protesting the Zhivkov regime's domination
 
 
 1105
 
 BULGARIA
 of the Orthodox Church, led successful marches and protests to
 establish Christmas and Easter as national holidays. Subev's
 "Alternative Easter Service," held at the same time as the
 Patriarch's service at Nevski Cathedral, drew the largest
 crowd for a religious ceremony in Bulgaria since the advent of
 the Communist era. Attendance at religious services increased
 substantially as security agents no longer accosted worshipers.
 Weddings in churches and openly held christenings are now
 regular events. Questions not yet addressed include the
 return of all property confiscated from the church; voluntary
 religious instruction in schools; and the removal from church
 leadership positions of those persons tainted by close
 association with the totalitarian regime.
 The Government has tried to rescind all facets of the previous
 regime's campaign to assimilate forcibly the country's Muslims.
 Security agents reportedly no longer prevent men from
 attending services at mosques. There is no interference with
 religious instruction, and several Bulgarian Muslims made the
 hajj and traveled to Saudi Arabia for religious education.
 The Government has not facilitated the printing of the Koran
 in Bulgarian, however, and most mosques suffer from a severe
 shortage of printed religious materials in the Bulgarian
 language.
 The Government has not interfered with the importation of a
 large number of Bibles in Bulgarian. Protestant and
 Evangelical groups have established foreign contacts to help
 import the Bibles. Several Evangelical churches and Bible
 centers have been formed and officially registered with the
 courts. Two such Protestant groups have been allowed to rent
 public halls for services, which they have called meetings in
 accordance with the law on public assemblies. An Easter
 service by one church filled the Bulgaria Hall, a concert
 center which seats more than 1,000 people.
 The Roman Catholic community also revived and received a
 number of foreign visitors, including a group of archbishops
 and bishops from the United States in July. Bulgaria
 reestablished diplomatic relations with the Vatican in
 December, and the Pope accepted an invitation to visit Bulgaria
 in 1991. Overflow services at Sofia's Roman Catholic Church
 in 1990 drew a much larger number of local citizens- than in
 previous years. The Roman Catholic population of approximately
 60,000 (evenly divided between the'Latin and Uniate rites) is-
 served by less than 40 priests, or less than one-fifth the
 number that existed when the Communists took power.
 Bulgaria's small Jewish community of 4,000 to 5,000, people,
 which was spared from the holocaust and, for the most part,
 emigrated to Israel soon after World War II, was allowed to
 establish international contacts. One of the six Jews elected
 to the GNA, Solomon Passi, was one of the first to be allowed
 to obtain religious education abroad.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 -President Zhelev abolished a 1974 decree that restricted
 citizens' rights to residency in certain major urban areas.
 The decree, combined with registration requirements for
 citizens traveling anywhere outside of their registered
 domicile within the country, had limited freedom of movement.
 Now citizens are free to relocate to other cities or areas,
 
 
 1106
 BULGARIA
 although in practice this right will be greatly limited by the
 severe housing shortage and economic difficulties.
 Following the passage in 1989 of new passport, travel, and
 citizenship laws, Bulgarian authorities in 1990 issued
 passports to tens of thousands of Bulgarian citizens. Many
 thousands left Bulgaria, both before and after the elections
 to seek work or asylum in the West.
 In August the GNA invited all emigres to return to Bulgaria
 without fear of persecution or punishment for certain
 previously illegal acts, such as political offenses. This
 invitation reinforced the citizenship law which guaranteed the
 right of return and an amnesty to citizens who had left during
 Zhivkov's rule. Stefan Cholakov, a leading dissident who was
 expelled in 1988, returned and resettled in 1990. Leading
 Radio Free Europe reporter Rumiana Usunova, who had been
 vilified in the press and who had received death threats as
 recently as November 1989, was asked to return as editor in
 chief of the major opposition newspaper. Several emigres
 returned and ran for the GNA as UDF candidates.
 Bulgarian treatment of asylum seekers has improved. For
 example, Romanian and Soviet citizens were allowed to remain
 in Bulgaria far beyond the terms of their visas as they
 applied for asylum in Bulgaria and elsewhere. In July two
 Soviet citizens who had tried unsuccessfully to remain in
 Greece were allowed to stay in Sofia as their applications for
 asylum in Bulgaria were being adjudicated.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Constitutional amendments passed in 1990 provide citizens the
 legal right to change the government, a right they exercized
 in the June elections. The voting and counting procedures
 employed in these elections were relatively free and fair,
 although U.S. observers hedged their full endorsement of the
 entire campaign process, noting disparities in the distribution
 of resources and some intimidation of voters, especially in
 the provinces. In urban areas, citizens were able openly to
 support candidates of various parties, hear campaign
 advertising on television and radio, read uncensored
 opposition newspapers, and attend preelectoral rallies and
 meetings. In the provinces, there were reports of unfair
 restrictions on the opposition's use of public halls and
 squares for political meetings, on the distribution of
 opposition newspapers, and on access to local media. In
 addition, BSP local officials used their control over
 patronage to threaten retaliation against citizens who
 supported the opposition.
 The elections determined the composition of the 400-seat Grand
 National Assembly (GNA). Two hundred seats were determined in
 single-member constituencies on the basis of majority vote,
 while the remaining 200 deputies were drawn from party lists
 on the basis of proportional representation. The BSP won 211
 seats to the UDF's 144, the MRF's 23, and the Bulgarian
 National Agrarian Union's 16. Six seats were won by minor
 parties and independents.
 The GNA is identified in the Constitution as the primary
 lawmaking body. The Council of Ministers, led by a Prime
 Minister elected by a majority of the GNA, determines major
 policy objectives and is charged with implementing the laws in
 
 
 1107
 
 BULGARIA
 accordance with the Constitution. After failing to form a
 coalition with the opposition, outgoing Prime Minister Andrey
 Lukanov was forced to form an all-BSP government in late
 September. Lukanov then resigned on November 29 after his
 government was brought down by a general strike demanding his
 resignation. The President may also issue decrees, but the
 limits of his power as a third branch of government remained
 unclear under the amended Zhivkov-era constitution, which
 remains in force until a new constitution is adopted.
 The GNA in September passed a decree to dissolve existing
 local government councils and form new ones that include
 representatives of all political forces and will govern until.
 the first free local elections are held in February 1991.
 After the fall of the Lukanov Government, President Zhelev
 called for the new constitution to be completed by March 1991
 and new parliamentary elections to be held in May 1991,
 There are no overt restrictions, in law or in practice, on
 women's participation in government or politics, although
 their numbers are small and their influence is limited.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Local human rights organizations have become major voices in
 the campaign for extending fundamental human rights to all of
 Bulgaria's citizens. They include the Independent Society for
 the Defense of Human Rights, Citizens Initiative, the Club for
 the Repressed Since 1945, and the local chapter of Helsinki
 Watch. The Government received visitors from AI, Helsinki
 Watch, the International Human Rights Law Group, and similar
 organizations. Representatives of these international groups
 were free to contact local human rights organizations and to
 explore human rights developments. Many prisoners of
 conscience whose cases were championed and publicized by AI
 and Helsinki Watch arepnow leading figures in the political
 opposition and the GNA.
 The Independent Society has been allowed to visit prisons
 which house or housed political prisoners and has been allowed
 limited access to many people who 4re still being held in
 these facilities. The President's legal/pardons advisor
 stated he would personally supervise a review of each of these
 cases to insure that those held had been lawfully and fairly
 convicted of actual crimes and not subjected to purely
 political prosecution.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 While the. Constitution prohibits discrimination based on these
 criteria, prejudice and discrimination still exist against
 Bulgaria's Muslims and Gypsy minorities. Direct
 discrimination by the central Government was not documented in
 1990, but Muslims and other minorities still suffer-ed from
 public discrimination in housing, jobs, education, and health
 care. No major instances of violence against minority
 citizens were noted in 1990.
 Many ethnic Turks, who in 1989 had been forcibly exiled to
 Turkey or had emigrated, returned in 1990 to find that in many
 cases their homes ha&-been sold or razed without their consent.
 Local citizens and even government officials were widely
 
 
 1108
 BULGARIA
 reported to have taken advantage of the situation and to have
 profited personally from expropriations and sales of movable
 and immovable property. During the summer of 1990, the central
 Government instructed local governments to make every effort
 to resettle returning ethnic Turks expeditiously. Many
 Muslims, however, continued to be victims of exploitation and
 ethnic prejudice which prevented their acquisition of jobs and
 housing. Government representatives admitted that workers
 councils in various enterprises were sometimes reluctant to
 reinstate returning ethnic Turkish workers in their previous
 jobs. A 1990 International Labor Organization Conference
 Committee examined the situation of 220,000 ethnic Turkish
 minority workers. While noting the progress made, the
 Committee was not satisfied that the Government had taken
 sufficient measures to overcome the discrimination suffered by
 this population in terms of job restoration, housing, and
 related issues.
 Muslims and Gypsies were reportedly offered only the most
 inferior housing in many cities. They suffer widely from
 exclusion from positions of responsibility, even in farm
 collectives and agricultural enterprises. Supervisory jobs
 are generally given only to ethnic Bulgarian employees. Male
 Muslims and Gypsies are generally given the worst assignments
 during their periods of compulsory military service.
 Construction troops, which undertake a variety of civilian as
 well as military building and maintenance projects, are
 largely composed of minority conscripts of ethnic Turkish or
 Gypsy descent.
 In addition, severe ethnic discrimination has excluded ethnic
 Turks and Bulgarian Muslims from higher education. In 1990
 reportedly less than 100 of Bulgaria's 100,000 university-level
 students were Muslim
 Muslims remain dissatisfied with the Bulgarian official
 prohibition on circumcision outside of hospitals, although
 penalties for these operations and discrimination against
 patients who need treatment for postprocedure complications
 are reportedly declining. In some cases, hospitals in the
 Bulgarian-Turkish border regions and in towns such as Haskovo
 and Kurdzali reportedly continue to discriminate against
 Muslims in fundamental health care services and discourage
 religious rites such as circumcision.
 The Government has repeated its commitment of December 1989 to
 restoration of fundamental rights to the ethnic Turkish and
 Bulgarian Muslim minorities. However, many opposition and
 minority activists accuse local governments and BSP offices of
 initiating or tolerating nationalist and antiminority protest
 in various regions of the country. The Government has defended
 its lack of direct action against these protestors, who have
 disrupted basic city services in several areas, as deriving
 from fear of inciting genuine violence and further ill will
 between nationalists and the minority population. When
 nationalists in the Razgrad region, however, declared symbolic
 independence in protest against the new name change law and
 proposals for optional Turkish-language instruction in school,
 the Government, led by the President, and all major political
 forces immediately and unequivocally condemned this action.
 A new law, providing for restoration of names by means of an
 administrative procedure, marked a major human rights
 milestone, and other advances such as the opening of Islamic
 
 
 1109
 BULGARIA
 schools and cultural insitutes mark a further departure from
 past practices..
 Several organizations exist to defend the rights and interests
 of women. Many of these are closely linked, in ideology if
 not membership itself, with the Socialist Party. Women are
 not generally discriminated against in educational and
 professional opportunities. Under the Constitution, "every
 able-bodied citizen is obliged to do socially useful work,"
 and women are expected to hold full-time jobs in addition to
 their duties in the home. The Constitution states that men
 and women have equal rights. No statistics are available on
 violence against women.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Under the Bulgarian Constitution and Labor Code, as amended,
 all workers are entitled to form or join unions of their own
 choosing without previous authorization. With a large
 democratic opposition in Parliament and a President committed
 to depoliticizing the country's major political and civic
 institutions, many enterprises have made enormous strides in
 realizing such rights. Members of the civil service,
 including the militia and the diplomatic service, have begun
 to organize into trade unions. Podkrepa, the independent
 trade union movement, created in 1989, has spread rapidly
 through all sectors of the work force and, as of late 1990,
 claimed more than 300,000 members. About 55 percent of the
 work force of approximately 4 million is unionized, although
 most of it is in the trade union formerly integrated with the
 Communist Party. Reorganized in 1990 as the Confederation of
 Independent Trade Unions of Bulgaria (KNSB), these unions are
 ostensibly independent of the new Socialist Party.
 A new labor law, adopted in 1990, permits multiple trade union
 structures and imposes few restrictions on bread-and-butter
 trade unio activities. However, political activities by
 trade unionists and officials are restricted by the
 prohibition on political activity at the workplace. By
 agreement of the BSP, the UDF, and the Agrarians in roundtable
 talks, political parties are banned from the workplace. The
 BSP removed its organizations from enterprises prior to the
 June parliamentary elections.
 This new law also recognizes the right to strike when other
 means of conflict resolution have been exhausted, but the law
 forbids strikes for political purposes. Hundreds of legal and
 illegal strikes took place in 1990, especially in the first
 half of the year. By year's end, even militiamen and customs
 officers, supposedly in "essential services" exempted by law
 from the right to strike, had engaged in strikes. Virtually
 all workers are protected by dispute resolution mechanisms
 such as mediation and arbitration. For the most part, strikes
 in 1990 ended in wage increases and other job benefits for the
 striking workers. Mine, medical, and transport workers all
 won large concessions from the Government.
 The Government does not restrict unions from joining
 international federations. The KNSB has ended its affiliation
 with the Communist-dominated World Federation of Trade
 Unions. Podkrepa has contacts with We tern.trade unions,
 including the American Federation of Labor and Congress of
 Industrial Organizations.
 
 
 1110
 BULGARIA
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Bulgaria's labor law does not address antiunion discrimination.
 There were charges of interference with organizational efforts
 by Podkrepa during the preelection period; however, these may
 have been largely motiviated by specific political differences
 and have diminished or disappeared as Podkrepa has grown.
 Collective bargaining is not enshrined in the labor law. Wages
 are determined by a government code. The Minister of Labor,
 the Minister of Industry, Trade, and Services, and the Prime
 Minister may alter this code. In August wages were indexed to
 the cost of living and inflation as a result of a negotiated
 agreement with the participation of the KNSB and Podkrepa.
 Labor law and practice are the same in the special economic
 zones--currently there is a duty-free zone in Ruse, and 3 more
 zones are planned--as in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is not now prohibited by law,
 although it reportedly no longer exists as a form of
 punishment or sentence.
 Through 1989, compulsory labor had been required under state
 council decrees that directed the Government to assign labor
 where needed under critical circumstances. In 1989 the decree
 was implemented to put workers in jobs vacated by ethnic Turks
 who fled to Turkey during the mass exodus that summer. The
 decree was rescinded at the end of 1989.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 According to the Labor Code, 16 years is the minimum age for
 employment. Workers under the age of 18 years may not engage
 in heavy, harmful, or dangerous work. Their workweek is also
 limited to a maximum of 36 hours. Employers and the Ministry
 of Employment and Social Welfare enforce these provisions.
 They also enforce the requirement for compulsory education up
 to the age of 14.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The legal, maximum workweek for adults is 42.5 hours (5 days
 of 8.5 hours each) in most professions and occupations. Paid
 vacations are also required by law.
 The legal minimum wage since 1988 has been $50 per month at
 the current official commercial exchange rate. The average
 monthly wage is $100. The minimum wage is not sufficient for
 a single wage earner to provide a decent standard of living
 for a family. In families with two working spouses, the
 average wage provides, at best, a very modest standard of
 living.
 Bulgaria has a national labor safety program, and the KNSB is
 assigned a role in promoting job safety. Podkrepa has also
 undprtaken to protect workers' safety and promote good working
 conditions. No reliable figures are available on industrial
 accidents, and, as yet, no specific legal protection exists
 for workers who file complaints about hazardous conditions.
 Enforcement of safety standards varies greatly. Many
 citizens, however, have already turned to their new Assembly
 representatives with petitions and protests concerning their
 work conditions and job environment. Standards of enforcement
 of the safety program vary greatly.
